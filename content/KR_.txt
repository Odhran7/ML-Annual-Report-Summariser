​ 

stores 

​ 

as of january 29 2022 kroger operates supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the district of columbia as of january 29 2022 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2726 supermarkets of which 2252 had pharmacies and 1613 had fuel centers approximately 50 of our supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition we connect with customers through our expanding seamless ecosystem and the consistent delivery of a full fresh and friendly customer experience fuel sales are an important part of our revenue net earnings and loyalty offering our fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable each fuel center typically includes 5 to 10 islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 40000 to 50000 gallons of fuel supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses

​ 

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 225 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce

​ 

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products and toys

​ 

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

​ 

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store

segments 

​ 

we operate supermarkets multidepartment stores and fulfillment centers throughout the united states our retail operations which represent 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below

​ 

creating a safe environment 

​ 

our associates’ safety is a top priority and it is one of our core values since the beginning of the pandemic our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers we’ve implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and other facilities beyond the pandemic we prioritize providing the right safety training and equipment safe working conditions and resources to maintain and improve associates’ wellbeing through our strategy to set clear expectations routine monitoring and regular communication and engagement we reduce the number of injuries and accidents that happen in our workplace

we track health and safety metrics centrally for an enterprisewide view of issues trends and opportunities and monitor associate injury performance including total injuries occupational safety and health administration “osha” injury rates and losttime injuries as well as customer injury metrics like slipandfall injuries we also track the completion of required training for associates and we regularly share these metrics with leaders and relevant team members to inform management decisions

​ 

supporting labor relations 

​ 

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 310 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years wages health care and pensions are included in all of these collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 65 of our associates our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable healthcare for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities we serve our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business

​ 

managing climate impacts 

​ 

managing climate change impacts is an important part of thriving together  kroger’s environmental social  governance “esg” strategy and has been a focus for our business for many years with a large portfolio of supermarkets distribution warehouses and food production plants as well as a complex supply chain we recognize kroger’s impact on our climate we continue to explore opportunities and take steps to reduce the impacts of our operations on the environment and to reduce the potential risk of a changing climate on our operations this includes increasing our usage of renewable energy investments in new technologies and enhancing our operational efficiency the key elements of our esg strategy are included below 

​ 

governance 

​ 

climate impacts are managed by leadership with input from several departments across the business the public responsibilities committee of the board of directors oversees our responsibilities as a corporate citizen and the company’s practices related to environmental sustainability including climate impacts along with other environmental and social topics of material importance kroger discloses detailed energy and emissions data as well as our approach to managing climate effects in our annual esg report which can be found on our sustainability web site at wwwthekrogercocomesgreport  the information in our esg report is not part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

​ 

risk assessment 

​ 

to help identify and manage climaterelated risks to our business we conducted both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments that have assessed the effect and vulnerability of climate risk on our operations we have also assessed the likelihood and extent to which different climate risks such as extreme precipitation drought and heat stress would affect different types of facilities and geographies as a result of our risk assessments we do not currently anticipate the modeled physical risks to adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for the foreseeable future we plan to continue these qualitative and quantitative risk assessments moving forward 

​ 

kroger also acknowledges that current and emerging climaterelated legislation could affect our business as a result of forthcoming state and federal requirements regarding the phase down of hydrofluorocarbon hfc refrigerants we anticipate steadily replacing our refrigerant infrastructure to reach required levels which could incur significant costs to the business if legislation required an accelerated timeline regarding the phase down of hfc refrigerants we could incur higher costs this legislation will affect all retailers using refrigerants in their operations 

​ 

climate adaptation 

​ 

to help prepare for and manage a variety of risk scenarios including natural disasters and business disruptions to our supply chain we maintain more than 200 business continuity plans we have installed technologies and processes to ensure our supermarkets food production plants fulfillment centers and supply chain can respond quickly and remain operational we also monitor energy availability and costs to help anticipate how changing climate patterns like increasing temperatures could affect our energysourcing costs and activities our teams also monitor transition risks due to climate change including the effect possible new legislation may have on our business

​ 

climate mitigation 

​ 

for many years kroger has implemented emission reduction projects including energy efficiency improvements refrigerant leak detection and mitigation measures renewable energy installations and procurement and fleet efficiencies in 2020 we set a new goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30 by 2030 against a 2018 baseline the goal was developed using climate science and is aligned with the paris agreement specifically supporting a wellbelow 2°c climate scenario according to the absolute contraction method kroger anticipates resetting our current greenhouse gas reduction target to meet with the requirements of the science based target initiative which would include aligning with the 15°c scenario and setting a new scope 3 target 

​ 

additional discussion about our approach to managing climate effects is included in kroger’s annual esg report

​

risk factors 

tableend ​ 

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

​ 

competitive environment 

​ 

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by the fragmentation of local regional and national retailers including both retail and digital formats market consolidation intense competition and entry of nontraditional competitors customer behavior shifted quickly and considerably during the pandemic including a shift from food away from home to food at home we see three major trends shaping the industry postpandemic ecommerce cooking at home and prepared foods to go if we do not appropriately or accurately anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences or if trends shift more quickly to food away from home our sales and profitability could be adversely affected if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our customers our ability to compete and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

we are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our four competitive moats – seamless personalization fresh and our brands  each of these are strategic differentiators and each one is designed to better serve our customers and to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth momentum we believe our plans to continue to improve these four strategic differentiators will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers if we are unable to continue to enhance the foregoing key elements of our connection with customers or they fail to strengthen customer loyalty our ability to compete and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected our ecosystem monetizes the traffic and data insights generated by our retail supermarket business to create fastgrowing assetlight and margin rich revenue streams we may be unsuccessful in implementing our alternative profit strategy which could adversely affect our business growth and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability 

​ 

in addition evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online delivery ship to home and mobile channels in our industry increase the competitive environment we must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill customer orders providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences if we are not successful in reducing or offsetting the cost of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings expense reductions or alternative revenues our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

in addition if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant digital experience for our customers our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected digital retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with new developments by our competitors as well as the evolving needs and preferences of our customers our digital business has accelerated significantly during the covid19 pandemic including pickup delivery and ship we must compete by offering a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us and by investing in providing and maintaining relevant customerfacing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable and easy to use the future success of the digital business will also depend on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of fulfilling orders across our modalities whether in store in pickuponly locations or through customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado group plc

​ 

product safety 

​ 

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish we could be adversely affected by personal injury or product liability claims product recalls or other health and safety issues which occur from time to time if we sell products that cause illness or injury to customers resulting from product contamination or spoilage the presence of certain substances or damage caused in handling storage or transportation we could be exposed to claims or litigation any issue regarding the safety of items whether our brands items manufactured by the company or for the company or cpg products we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

employee matters 

​ 

a majority of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we are a party to approximately 310 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur and have occurred in the past if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions in addition changes to national labor policy could affect labor relations with our associates and relationships with unions further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

we have committed to paying fair wages and providing the benefits that were collectively bargained with the united food and commercial workers “ufcw” and other labor unions representing associates our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs changes to wage regulations including further increases in the minimum wage and extra pay ordinances enacted by local governments could have an impact on our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling wages and other costs is subject to numerous external factors including the available qualified workforce in each area where we are located unemployment levels within those areas wage rates and changes in employment and labor laws 

​ 

our continued success depends on the ongoing contributions of our associates including members of our senior management and other key personnel we must recruit hire develop and retain qualified associates with an increasingly large range of skills to meet the needs of our evolving and complex business we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them competition among potential employers has resulted and may in the future result in increased associate costs and has from time to time affected our ability to recruit and retain associates there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient highly qualified associates in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data and technology 

​ 

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  ​ 

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy

​ 

our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control and we regularly defend against and respond to data security incidents cyberattackers have targeted and accessed and may in the future again attempt to target and access information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information due to the political uncertainty involving russia and ukraine there is a possibility that the escalation of tensions could result in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly affect our operations although we have implemented procedures to protect our information and require our vendors to do the same we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against or be able to effectively respond to rapidly evolving increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against further a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information in addition hardware software or applications we may use may have inherent defects vulnerabilities or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security 

​ 

our cybersecurity program continued investment in our information technology systems and our processes to evaluate and select vendors with reasonable information security controls may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks data breaches or disruptions to our business operations which could result in a loss of customers or business information negative publicity damage to our reputation and exposure to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and may not be covered by our insurance in addition compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyberattacks are significant following a cyberattack our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberattack could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers and business relationships litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands reputation business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business our business depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information failures to honor new and evolving data privacy rights failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations or cash flows large scale data breaches at other entities including supply chain security vulnerabilities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ information there can be no assurance that such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated

​ 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to among other things systems changes and the development of new processes if we our third party service providers or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations or selfregulatory regimes that apply to all or parts of our business such as section 5 of the ftc act the california consumer privacy act ccpa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa or applicable international laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of noncompliance 

​ 

payment systems 

​ 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks select credit and debit cards and kroger pay a mobile payment solution as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us including due to short term disruption of service we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our payment card terminals or internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs and other costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members or if our thirdparty service providers’ systems are breached or compromised our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

indebtedness 

​ 

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

​ 

legal proceedings and insurance 

​ 

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury contract disputes regulatory claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows please also refer to the “litigation” section in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

​ 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability cyber risk exposure and associate health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability with respect to insured matters we are liable for retention amounts that vary by the nature of the claim and some losses may not be covered by insurance changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

multiemployer pension obligations 

​ 

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policiesmultiemployer pension plans” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing associates covered by those agreements we believe the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to most of these funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably or adjust their current views unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

​ 

we also currently bear the investment risk of two multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

integration of new business and strategic alliances 

​ 

we enter into mergers acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated or desired benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies capital requirements and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

fuel 

​ 

we sell a significant amount of fuel in our 1613 fuel centers which could face increased regulation including due to climate change or other environmental concerns and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of war or terrorism disruptions to the economy including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic the recent invasion of ukraine by russia and other matters that affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react to such factors which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

economic conditions 

​ 

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions and other economic factors that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions overall economic slowdown or recession changes in housing market conditions changes in government benefits such as snapebt or child care credits the availability of credit interest rates inflation or deflation tax rates and other matters could reduce consumer spending inflation could materially affect our operating results through increases to our cost of goods supply chain costs and labor costs in addition the economic factors listed above or any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors can increase our merchandise costs and operating general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows increased fuel prices also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell a deterioration in overall economic conditions the likelihood of which is made more uncertain by the recent increases in the inflation rate could adversely affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

covid19 

​ 

the global covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business two full years into the pandemic many factors and uncertainties remain including

in addition we cannot predict with certainty the extent of the effect that covid19 will have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions however any adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us to the extent that covid19 continues to affect the us and global economy and our business it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and operational risk as a result of regulatory requirements 

​ 

legal and government regulation 

​ 

we are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business including laws and regulations involving antitrust and competition privacy data protection environmental healthcare antibribery anticorruption tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters these and other rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies create challenges for the company may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively affect our reputation and our business results additionally we are currently and in the future may be subject to a number of inquiries investigations claims proceeding and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

in addition increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental social and governance esg matters including expanding voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change waste production water usage human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report and could negatively affect the company’s reputation

​ 

additionally we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages and new provisions relating to the covid19 pandemic we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

weather natural disasters and other events 

​ 

a large number of our stores distribution facilities and fulfillment centers are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts ice and snow storms and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters have and may again in the future disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities moreover the effects of climate change including those associated with extreme weather events may affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities that are optimal for us or at all adverse weather natural disasters geopolitical and catastrophic events such as war civil unrest acts of terrorism or other acts of violence including active shooter situations which have occurred in the past at our locations or pandemics such as the spread of covid19 or other future pandemics and other matters that could reduce consumer spending could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

climate impact 

​ 

the longterm effects of global climate change present both physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable these changes could over time affect for example the availability and cost of products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require in addition many of our operations and facilities are in locations that may be affected by the physical risks of climate change and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events we also use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our operations all of which could face increased regulation and cost increases as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns transitioning to alternative energy sources such as renewable electricity or electric vehicles could incur higher costs regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs will also increase in coming years which may increase our costs associated with compliance tracking reporting and sourcing these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

supply chain 

​ 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively affect our business the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our business the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites acts of war or terrorism disruptive global political events for example the recent invasion of ukraine by russia quality control issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters or health crises including the covid19 pandemic regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 ​ 

covid19 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is continuing to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations we expect the ultimate significance will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic and any governmental and public actions taken in response since the beginning of the pandemic our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers we’ve implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and other facilities 

​ 

as the pandemic has evolved we have experienced unusually strong sales beginning in 2020 and continuing throughout 2021 we continue to see people eat and work more from home and prioritize health and cleanliness the change in customer behavior caused by covid19 was a major factor in our results over the past two years the pandemic brought to the forefront the importance to the customer of fresh and a seamless digital offering we continued to invest and grow our capabilities in these areas which led to achieving positive identical sales without fuel in 2021 against very strong identical sales results last year which results in a twoyear stacked growth rate of 143 digital sales twoyear stacked growth was 113 for 2021  enabled by our team’s ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers’ demand for safe lowtouch or touchless shopping modalities

​ 

our operating general and administrative “oga” expenses for 2021 reflected a reduction of the significant covid related costs we incurred in 2020 our oga expenses for 2020 included significant incremental costs related to investments in pay and benefits for our associates and measures to safeguard our associates and customers as a percentage of sales these incremental costs in 2020 were partially offset by sales leverage resulting from strong sales growth due to the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats over the past two fiscal years allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet at the onset of the pandemic in march 2020 we proactively borrowed 1 billion under the revolving credit facility this was a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility reduce reliance on the commercial paper market and maintain liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic during 2020 we fully repaid the 1 billion borrowed under the revolving credit facility in addition to 12 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding as of yearend 2019 using cash generated by operations we maintain a temporary cash investment balance of 15 billion as of yearend 2021

use of nongaap financial measures 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap

​ 

we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management and management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the merchandising and operational effectiveness of our gotomarket strategy 

​ 

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management and management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the operational effectiveness of our financial model 

​ 

the adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted fifo operating profit metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods we believe adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted fifo operating profit are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate yearoveryear comparisons of our net earnings net earnings per diluted share and fifo operating profit because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations  net earnings for 2021 include the following which we define as the “2021 adjusted items”

key performance indicators 

​ 

we evaluate our results of operations and cash flows using a variety of key performance indicators such as sales identical sales excluding fuel fifo gross margin adjusted fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share and return on invested capital we use these financial metrics and related computations to evaluate our operational effectiveness and our results of operations from period to period and to plan for near and longterm operating and strategic decisions these key performance indicators should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap these measures which are described in more detail in this annual report on form 10k may not be comparable to similarlytitled performance indicators used by other companies 

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

sales 

​ 

total sales 

 in millions

 

 ​ 

total sales increased in 2021 compared to 2020 by 41 the increase was primarily due to an increase in supermarket fuel sales total sales excluding fuel increased 02 in 2021 compared to 2020 which was primarily due to our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 02 identical sales excluding fuel increased in 2021 on top of record sales results in 2020 which was primarily caused by unprecedented demand due to the covid19 pandemic during 2020 our twoyear identical sales excluding fuel stacked growth was 143 total supermarket fuel sales increased 547 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in fuel gallons sold of 79 and an increase in the average retail fuel price of 436 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

​ 

total sales increased in 2020 compared to 2019 by 84 the increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel partially offset by a reduction in supermarket fuel sales and decreased sales due to the disposal of turkey hill dairy and you technology in the first quarter of 2019 total sales to retail customers without fuel increased 136 in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 141 partially offset by decreased sales due to the deconsolidation of lucky’s market in the fourth quarter of 2019 total sales excluding fuel and dispositions increased 142 in 2020 compared to 2019 the significant increase in identical sales excluding fuel was caused by unprecedented demand due to the covid19 pandemic digital sales growth and growth in market share market share growth contributed to our identical sales increase excluding fuel as our sales outpaced the general growth in the food retail industry during 2020 the increase in identical sales excluding fuel was broad based across all supermarket divisions and remained heightened throughout 2020 during the pandemic customers reduced trips while significantly increasing basket value 

​ 

total supermarket fuel sales decreased 325 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 175 and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 182 the decrease in fuel gallons sold was reflective of the national trend which decreased due to the covid19 pandemic the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel

​ 

we calculate identical sales excluding fuel as sales to retail customers including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations kroger specialty pharmacy businesses and shiptohome solutions we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we define kroger specialty pharmacy businesses as identical when physical locations have been in operation continuously for five full quarters discontinued patient therapies are excluded from the identical sales calculation starting in the quarter of transfer or termination although identical sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies our identical sales excluding fuel results are summarized in the following table we used the identical sales excluding fuel dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2021 and 2020

identical sales 

 in millions

​ 

 ​ 

gross margin lifo and fifo gross margin 

​ 

we define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in gross margin

​ 

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2201 in 2021 and 2332 in 2020 the decrease in rate in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from increased fuel sales which have a lower gross margin rate a decrease in our fuel gross margin continued strategic investments in lower prices for our customers a covid19related inventory write down for personal protective equipment donated to community partners a higher lifo charge and increased shrink and transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by growth in our alternative profit streams and effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold 

​ 

our lifo charge was 197 million in 2021 compared to a lifo credit of 7 million in 2020 the increase in our lifo charge was attributable to higher inflation in most categories with grocery and meat being the largest contributors 

​ 

our fifo gross margin rate which excludes the lifo charge was 2215 in 2021 compared to 2332 in 2020 our fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel our fifo gross margin rate decreased 43 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 this decrease resulted primarily from continued strategic investments in lower prices for our customers a covid19related inventory write down for personal protective equipment donated to community partners and increased shrink and transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by growth in our alternative profit streams and effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold 

operating general and administrative expenses 

​ 

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages healthcare benefit costs retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga

​ 

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1683 in 2021 and 1849 in 2020 the decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from decreased covid19related costs lower contributions to multiemployer pension plans decreased incentive plan costs the 2020 oga adjusted items the effect of increased fuel sales which decreases our oga rate as a percentage of sales and broadbased improvement from cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies store productivity and sourcing cost reductions partially offset by significant investments in our associates and the 2021 oga adjusted items 

​ 

our fuel sales lower our oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel the 2021 oga adjusted items and the 2020 oga adjusted items our oga rate decreased 61 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 this decrease resulted primarily from decreased covid19related costs lower contributions to multiemployer pension plans decreased incentive plan costs and broadbased improvement from cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies store productivity and sourcing cost reductions partially offset by significant investments in our associates 

​ 

rent expense 

​ 

rent expense was 845 million or 061 of sales for 2021 compared to 874 million or 066 of sales for 2020 rent expense as a percentage of sales decreased 5 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the completion of a property transaction related to 28 previously leased properties that we are now accounting for as owned locations and therefore recognizing depreciation and amortization expense over their useful life for additional information about this transaction see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense was 28 billion or 205 of sales for 2021 compared to 27 billion or 207 of sales for 2020 depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent as a percentage of sales in 2021 compared to 2020 

​ 

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

​ 

operating profit was 35 billion or 252 of sales for 2021 compared to 28 billion or 210 of sales for 2020 operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 42 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 due to decreased oga expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by an increased lifo charge and a lower fifo gross margin rate fuel earnings also contributed to our operating profit growth for 2021 compared to 2020

fifo operating profit was 37 billion or 266 of sales for 2021 compared to 28 billion or 209 of sales for 2020 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2021 and 2020 adjusted items increased 7 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 due to decreased oga expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by a lower fifo gross margin rate fuel earnings also contributed to our fifo operating profit growth for 2021 compared to 2020 

​ 

specific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and fifo operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section

​ 

the following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to fifo operating profit and to adjusted fifo operating profit  excluding the 2021 and 2020 adjusted items

​ 

 

 ​ 

interest expense 

​ 

interest expense totaled 571 million in 2021 and 544 million in 2020 the increase in interest expense in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the completion of a property transaction related to 28 previously leased properties that we are now accounting for as owned locations the structure used to complete this transaction requires our liability to be shown as debt as a result of this transaction rent expense decreased with a corresponding increase in interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense for additional information about this transaction see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective income tax rate was 188 in 2021 and 232 in 2020 the 2021 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to a discrete benefit of 47 million which was primarily from the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations covering multiple years the benefit from sharebased payments and the utilization of tax credits partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2020 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions

​ 

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

​ 

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section

​ 

net earnings of 217 per diluted share for 2021 represented a decrease of 336 compared to net earnings of 327 per diluted share for 2020 adjusted net earnings of 368 per diluted share for 2021 represented an increase of 61 compared to adjusted net earnings of 347 per diluted share for 2020 the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from increased fifo operating profit excluding fuel increased fuel earnings and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by a higher lifo charge 

​ 

return on invested capital 

​ 

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted roic operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit for roic purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge credit depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve and iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets

​ 

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies

​ 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2021 and 2020 on a 52 week basis  in millions

​ 

 

1 taxes receivable were 42 as of january 29 2022 66 as of january 30 2021 and 82 as of february 1 2020

2 other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 9 as of january 30 2021 we did not have any accrued income taxes as of january 29 2022 and february 1 2020 accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates

​ 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain

​ 

impairments of longlived assets 

​ 

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 64 million in 2021 and 70 million in 2020 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as oga expense

​ 

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results

​ 

business combinations 

​ 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting all the assets acquired liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available we use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances including the income approach significant estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill see note 2 for further information about goodwill 

​ 

goodwill 

​ 

our goodwill totaled 31 billion as of january 29 2022 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

​ 

our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter the 2021 fair value of our kroger specialty pharmacy reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach a market multiple model and a comparable mergers and acquisition model market approaches with each method weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on management’s projected future cash flows estimates of revenue growth rates margin assumptions and an appropriate discount rate the market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2021 2020 and 2019 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

​ 

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2021 2020 and 2019 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses

​ 

multiemployer pension plans 

​ 

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans

​ 

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 11 billion in 2021 619 million in 2020 and 461 million in 2019 the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 is due to the contractual payments we made in 2021 related to our commitments established for certain ratification agreements the increase in 2020 compared to 2019 is due to incremental contributions we made in 2020 to multiemployer pension plans helping stabilize future associate benefits

​ 

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these offbalance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds 

​ 

based on the most recent information available to us we believe the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that our contributions to most of these funds will increase over the next few years  we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2021 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer 

​ 

as of december 31 2021 we estimate our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately 11 billion 850 million net of tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 600 million 450 million net of tax as of december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to higher expected returns on assets in the funds during 2021 and the restructuring of the sound retirement trust helping stabilize future associate benefits our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable

​ 

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

​ 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made

cash flow information 

​ 

the following table summarizes our net increase in cash and temporary cash investments for 2021 and 2020 

​ 

 ​ 

net cash provided by operating activities 

​ 

we generated 62 billion of cash from operations in 2021 compared to 68 billion in 2020 net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted for noncash items generated approximately 64 billion of operating cash flow in 2021 compared to 52 billion in 2020 cash provided used by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities including working capital was 229 million in 2021 compared to 16 billion in 2020 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities including working capital was primarily due to the following 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

cash paid for taxes decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower taxable income in 2021 compared to 2020 

​ 

net cash used by investing activities 

​ 

investing activities used cash of 26 billion in 2021 compared to 28 billion in 2020 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to decreased payments for property and equipment in 2021 due to timing of payments 

​ 

net cash used by financing activities 

​ 

we used 34 billion of cash for financing activities in 2021 compared to 27 billion in 2020 the amount of cash used for financing activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the following 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

capital investments 

​ 

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding the purchase of leased facilities totaled 32 billion in 2021 and 2020 capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 58 million in 2020 we did not purchase any leased facilities in 2021 our capital priorities align directly with our value creation model and our target to consistently grow net earnings our capital program includes initiatives to enhance the customer experience in stores improve our process efficiency and enhance our digital capabilities through technology developments as such we increased our allocation of capital investments related to digital and technology compared to prior years these investments are expected to drive digital sales growth and improve operating efficiency by removing cost and waste from our business

debt management 

​ 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of obligations under finance leases decreased 49 million to 134 billion as of yearend 2021 compared to 2020 the decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted from the payments of 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 260 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 295 and 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 340 partially offset by an increase in debt primarily from the completion of a property transaction and a net increase in obligations under finance leases of 616 million primarily related to our three kroger delivery customer fulfillment center openings we purchased and then immediately sold a portfolio of 28 of our existing stores allowing us to secure longterm access to these locations at favorable lease rates the structure used to complete this transaction requires our liability to be shown as debt 

​ 

common share repurchase programs 

​ 

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 14 billion in 2021 and 12 billion in 2020 

​ 

in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 225 million in 2021 and 128 million in 2020 of our common shares under the stock option program

​ 

on september 11 2020 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “september 2020 repurchase program” the september 2020 repurchase program was exhausted on june 11 2021 on june 16 2021 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “june 2021 repurchase program” on december 30 2021 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “december 2021 repurchase program” the december 2021 repurchase program authorization replaced the existing june 2021 repurchase program

​ 

the shares repurchased in 2021 were reacquired under the following share repurchase programs 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of january 29 2022 there was 821 million remaining under the december 2021 repurchase program

​ 

during the first quarter through march 23 2022 we repurchased an additional 92 million of our common shares under the stock option program and 287 million additional shares under the december 2021 repurchase program as of march 23 2022 we have 534 million remaining under the december 2021 repurchase program 

​ 

dividends 

​ 

the following table provides dividend information for 2021 and 2020  in millions except per share amounts

​ 

 ​ 

liquidity needs 

​ 

we held cash and temporary cash investments of 18 billion as of the end of 2021 which reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital we actively manage our cash and temporary cash investments in order to internally fund operating activities support and invest in our core businesses make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through cash dividend payments and share repurchases our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions we remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase programs and we will evaluate the optimal use of any excess free cash flow consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy 

​ 

the table below summarizes our shortterm and longterm material cash requirements based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 29 2022 in millions of dollars

​ 

 

 ​ 

we expect to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs with cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2021 cash flows from our operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs include anticipated requirements for working capital to maintain our operations pension plan commitments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper servicing our lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities capital investments payments deferred under the cares act and other purchase obligations we may also require additional capital in the future to fund organic growth opportunities additional customer fulfilment centers joint ventures or other business partnerships property development or acquisitions dividends and share repurchases in addition we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

​

​ 

factors affecting liquidity 

​ 

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at january 29 2022 we had no outstanding commercial paper commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis factors that could affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and financial position the state of the economy the current inflationary environment conditions in the food retail industry and changes in our business model further information on the risks and uncertainties that can affect our business can be found in the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10k although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating “public debt rating” means as of any date the rating that has been most recently announced by either sp or moody’s as the case may be for any class of noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by the company as of march 23 2022 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding

​ 

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio our “financial covenant” a failure to maintain our financial covenant would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility this financial covenant is described below

​ 

 ​ 

our credit facility is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenant at yearend 2021

​ 

as of january 29 2022 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on july 6 2026 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of january 29 2022 we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 2 million as of january 29 2022 

​ 

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 29 2022 we had authorized for issuance 33 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on may 24 2019

​ 

we maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost or decrease the funds available under our credit facility if the letters of credit were issued against our credit facility we had 412 million of outstanding surety bonds as of january 29 2022 these surety bonds expire during fiscal year 2022 and are expected to be renewed 

​ 

we have standby letters of credit outstanding as part of our insurance program and for other business purposes the letters of credit for our insurance program collateralize obligations to our insurance carriers in connection with the settlement of potential claims we have also provided a letter of credit which supports our commitment to build a certain number of fulfillment centers the balance of this letter of credit reduces primarily upon the construction of each fulfillment center if we do not reach our total purchase commitment we will be responsible for the balance remaining on the letter of credit we had 363 million of outstanding standby letters of credit as of january 29 2022 these standby letters of credit expire during fiscal year 2022 and are expected to be renewed letters of credit do not represent liabilities of ours and are not reflected in the company’s consolidated b alance sheets

​ 

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities

​ 

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against thirdparty claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

​ 

twoyear financial results 

​ 

significant fluctuations occurred in our business during 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic as a result management compares current year identical sales without fuel adjusted fifo operating profit and adjusted net earnings per diluted share results to the same metrics for the comparable period in 2019 in addition to comparisons made to 2020 this enables management to evaluate results of the business and our financial model over a longer period of time and to better understand the state of the business after the height of the pandemic compared to the period of time prior to the pandemic the purpose of the following tables is to better illustrate comparable twoyear growth from our ongoing business for 2021 for identical sales without fuel adjusted fifo operating profit and adjusted net earnings per diluted share compared to 2019 two year financial results for these measures are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate comparisons of results and trends over a longer period of time to demonstrate the effect of covid19 on our results the tables provide the twoyear stacked results or compounded annual growth rate for each measure presented and how it was calculated items identified in these tables should not be considered alternatives to any other measure of performance these items should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes for the companys financial results including those measures reported in accordance with gaap due to the nature of these items as further described below it is important to identify these items and to review them in conjunction with the companys financial results reported in accordance with gaap

financial risk management 

​ 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations w e are exposed to market risk from a variety of sources including changes in interest rates commodity prices the fair value of certain equity investments and defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans our market risk exposures are discussed below 

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25 of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

​ 

when we use derivative financial instruments it is primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets we had no forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of january 29 2022 or january 30 2021 

​

​ 

commodity price risk 

​ 

we are subject to commodity price risk generated by our purchases of meat seafood and dairy products among other food items we purchase manufacture and sell various commodity related food products and risk arises from the price volatility of these commodities the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations to help manage or minimize the effect of commodity price risk exposure on our operations we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts and have the ability to increase or decrease retail prices to our customers as commodity prices change 

​ 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of diesel and unleaded fuel the majority of our fuel contracts utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential we expect to take delivery of these commitments in the normal course of business and as a result these contracts qualify as normal purchases while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount which can affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the shortterm 

​ 

we have entered into fixed price contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas for a portion of our energy needs we expect to take delivery of these commitments in the normal course of business and as a result these contracts qualify as normal purchases 

​ 

as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 we had no commodity derivative contracts outstanding

​ 

equity investment risk 

​ 

we are exposed to market price volatility for our investment in ocado group plc “ocado” which is measured at fair value through net earnings f air value adjustments flow through “loss gain on investments” in the company’s consolidated statements of operations  the change in fair value of this investment resulted in an unrealized loss gain on investments of 821 million in 2021 10 billion in 2020 and 157 million in 2019 as of january 29 2022 the value of our investment in ocado was 987 million as of january 29 2022 a 10 change in the fair value of this investment would be approximately 100 million for additional details on this investment s ee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

companysponsored benefit plans 

​ 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement healthcare plans for certain eligible employees changes in interest rates affect our liabilities associated with these retirement plans as well as the amount of expense recognized for these retirement plans increased interest rates could result in a lower fair value of plan assets and increased pension expense in the following years the target plan asset allocations are established based on our ldi strategy an ldi strategy focuses on maintaining a close to fullyfunded status over the longterm with minimal funded status risk this is achieved by investing more of the plan assets in fixed income instruments to more closely match the duration of the plan liability as of january 29 2022 our defined benefit pension plans had total investment assets of 31 billion declines in the fair value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to these plans for additional details s ee note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend ​ 

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 30 2021 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes the kroger fact book and other additional information about the company kroger’s website and any reports or other information made available by kroger through its website are not part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

​ 

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2020 2019 and 2018 are to the fiscal years ended january 30 2021 february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

​ 

stores 

​ 

as of january 30 2021 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2742 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names of which 2255 had pharmacies and 1596 had fuel centers we offer pickup also referred to as clicklist® and harris teeter expresslane™— personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 2223 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to substantially all of kroger households approximately 51 of our supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition fuel sales are an important part of our revenue net earnings and loyalty offering our fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable each fuel center typically includes 5 to 10 islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 40000 to 50000 gallons of fuel supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses

​ 

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 225 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce

​ 

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products and toys

​ 

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

​ 

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store

​ 

segments 

​ 

we operate supermarkets and multidepartment stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below

risk factors 

tableend ​ 

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

​ 

competitive environment 

​ 

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation customer behavior shifted quickly and considerably during the pandemic including a shift from food away from home to food at home we see three major trends shaping the industry postpandemic ecommerce cooking at home and prepared foods to go if we do not appropriately or accurately anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences or if trends shift more quickly to food away from home our sales and profitability could be adversely affected if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our customers our ability to compete and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

we are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our four competitive moats – seamless personalization fresh and our brands  each of these are strategic differentiators and each one is designed to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth momentum we believe our plans to deepen and strengthen our competitive moats provide a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers if we are unable to continue to enhance the foregoing key elements of our connection with customers or they fail to strengthen customer loyalty our ability to compete and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected our ecosystem monetizes the traffic and data insights generated by our enhanced customer experience we are using our assets in new ways through these fastgrowing assetlight and margin rich businesses we may be unsuccessful in implementing our alternative profit strategy which could adversely affect our market share and business growth and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability 

​ 

in addition evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online delivery ship to home and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment we must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill customer orders providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences if we are not successful in reducing or offsetting the cost of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings expense reductions or alternative revenues our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

in addition if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant digital experience for our customers our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted digital retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with new developments by our competitors as well as the evolving needs and preferences of our customers our digital business accelerated significantly during the covid19 pandemic including pickup delivery and ship we must compete by offering a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us and by investing in providing and maintaining relevant customerfacing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable and easy to use the future success of the digital business will also depend on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of fulfilling orders across our modalities whether in store in pickuponly locations and through customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado

​ 

product safety 

​ 

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish we could be adversely affected by personal injury or project liability claims product recalls or other health and safety issues if we sell products that cause illness or injury to customers resulting from product contamination or spoilage the presence of certain substances or damage caused in handling storage or transportation we could be exposed to claims or litigation any issue regarding the safety of items whether our brands items manufactured by the company or for the company or cpg products we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

employee matters 

​ 

a majority of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we are a party to approximately 350 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions in addition changes to national labor policy could affect labor relations with our associates and relationships with unions further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

we are committed to paying fair wages and providing the benefits that were collectively bargained with the united food and commercial workers “ufcw” and other labor unions representing associates our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs changes to wage regulations including further increases in the minimum wage and extra pay ordinances enacted by local governments could have an impact on our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling wages and other costs is subject to numerous external factors including the available qualified workforce in each area where we are located unemployment levels within those areas wage rates and changes in employment and labor laws 

​ 

our continued success depends on the ongoing contributions of our associates including members of our senior management and other key personnel we must recruit hire develop and retain qualified associates with an increasingly large range of skills to meet the needs of our evolving and complex business we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them competition among potential employers could result in increased associate costs or in our failure to recruit and retain associates there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient highly qualified associates in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data and technology 

​ 

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  ​ 

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy

​ 

our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control and we regularly defend against and respond to data security incidents cyberattackers have targeted and accessed and may in the future again attempt to target and access information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information although we have implemented procedures to protect our information and require our vendors to do the same we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against or be able to effectively respond to rapidly evolving increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against further a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information in addition hardware software or applications we may use may have inherent defects vulnerabilities or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security 

​ 

our cybersecurity program continued investment in our information technology systems and our processes to evaluate and select vendors with reasonable information security controls may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks data breaches or disruptions to our business operations which could result in a loss of customers or business information negative publicity damage to our reputation and exposure to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and may not be covered by our insurance in addition compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyberattacks are significant following a cyberattack our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberattack could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers and business relationships litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands reputation business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business our business depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations or cash flows large scale data breaches at other entities including supply chain security vulnerabilities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ information there can be no assurance that such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated

​ 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to among other things systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act ccpa or the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of noncompliance 

​ 

payment systems 

​ 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks select credit and debit cards and kroger pay a mobile payment solution as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us including due to short term disruption of service we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our payment card terminals or internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs and other costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members or if our thirdparty service providers’ systems are breached or compromised our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

indebtedness 

​ 

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

​ 

legal proceedings and insurance 

​ 

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury contract disputes regulatory claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows please also refer to the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability cyber risk exposure and associate health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability with respect to insured matters we are liable for retention amounts that vary by the nature of the claim and some losses may not be covered by insurance changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

multiemployer pension obligations 

​ 

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policiesmultiemployer pension plans” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing associates covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably or adjust their current views unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

​ 

we also currently bear the investment risk of two multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

integration of new business and strategic alliances 

​ 

we enter into mergers acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated or desired benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies capital requirements and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

fuel 

​ 

we sell a significant amount of fuel in our 1596 fuel centers which could face increased regulation including due to climate change or other environmental concerns and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism disruptions to the economy including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react to such factors which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

economic conditions 

​ 

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

weather natural disasters and other events 

​ 

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities moreover the effects of climate change including those associated with extreme weather events may affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities that are optimal for us or at all adverse weather natural disasters geopolitical and catastrophic events such as war civil unrest acts of terrorism or other acts of violence including active shooter situations which have occurred in the past at our locations or pandemics such as the spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 or other future pandemics and other matters that could reduce consumer spending could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

covid19

the global covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business a full year into the pandemic many factors and uncertainties remain including 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

in addition we cannot predict with certainty the extent of the impact that covid19 will have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions however any material adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us to the extent that covid19 continues to affect the us and global economy and our business it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and operational risk as a result of regulatory requirements 

​ 

government regulation 

​ 

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages and new provisions relating to the covid19 pandemic we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

supply chain 

​ 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our business the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites acts of war or terrorism quality control issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters or health crises regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

our financial model is underpinned by our leading position in food we continue to invest in areas of the business that matter most to our customers and deepen our competitive moats to drive sales growth in our retail supermarket business including fuel and pharmacy this in turn generates the data and traffic that enables our fastgrowing alternative profit streams our financial strategy is to continue to use our free cash flow to invest in the business to drive longterm sustainable net earnings growth through the identification of highreturn projects that support our strategy capital allocation is a core element of our value creation model and we will allocate capital towards driving profitable sales growth accelerating digital expanding margin as well as maintaining the business we will continue to be disciplined in deploying capital towards projects that exceed our hurdle rate of return and prioritize the highest return opportunities to drive 3 to 5 net earnings growth at the same time we are committed to maintaining our net debt to adjusted ebitda range of 230 to 250 in order to keep our current investment grade debt rating our resilient cash flow will allow us to continue to grow our dividend over time and continue to return excess cash to investors via share repurchases resulting in consistently strong and sustainable total shareholder return of between 8 and 11

covid19 

​ 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization announced that infections of covid19 had become a pandemic and on march 13 the us president announced a national emergency relating to the disease the impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows was material in fiscal year 2020 we expect the ultimate significance will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic and any governmental and public actions taken in response 

​ 

since the beginning of the pandemic our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers we’ve implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and other facilities including safety partitions and physical distancing floor decals implementation of customer capacity limits and providing personal protective equipment like masks for our associates all of which are described in our blueprint for businesses – an open source guide we created to help other companies navigate the complexities of safely operating during a pandemic 

​ 

as the pandemic has evolved we have experienced unusually strong sales we continue to see people eat and work more from home and prioritize health and cleanliness the change in customer behavior caused by covid19 was a major factor in our 2020 results the pandemic brought to the forefront the importance to the customer of fresh and digital we continued to invest and grow our capabilities in these areas leading to gains in both digital and total food at home market share identical sales without fuel were 141 for 2020 as customers continued to consolidate trips and spend more per transaction digital revenue grew 116 in 2020 enabled by our team’s ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers’ demand for safe lowtouch or touchless shopping modalities 

​ 

our oga expenses include significant incremental costs related to investments in pay and benefits for our associates and measures to safeguard our associates and customers supported by our strong performance and cash position in 2020 we committed more than 25 billion to safeguard the environment our associates and customers work and shop in and to reward associates including committing nearly 1 billion to better secure pensions for over 30000 associates this was in addition to paid emergency leave financial assistance through our helping hands program and more as a percentage of sales these incremental costs were partially offset by sales leverage resulting from strong sales growth due to the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

on march 18 2020 we proactively borrowed 1 billion under the revolving credit facility this was a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility reduce reliance on the commercial paper market and maintain liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats during the pandemic allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet during 2020 we fully repaid the 1 billion borrowed under the revolving credit facility and 12 billion in outstanding commercial paper obligations as of yearend 2019 using cash generated by operations 

​

use of nongaap financial measures 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 

​ 

we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness

​ 

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness 

  

the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate yearoveryear comparisons for our net earnings and net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations net earnings for 2020 include the following which we define as the “2020 adjusted items” 

​

 ​ 

total sales increased in 2020 compared to 2019 by 84 the increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel partially offset by a reduction in supermarket fuel sales and decreased sales due to the disposal of turkey hill dairy and you technology in the first quarter of 2019 total sales to retail customers without fuel increased 136 in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 141 partially offset by decreased sales due to the deconsolidation of lucky’s market in the fourth quarter of 2019 total sales excluding fuel and dispositions increased 142 in 2020 compared to 2019 the significant increase in identical sales excluding fuel was caused by unprecedented demand due to the covid19 pandemic digital sales growth and growth in market share market share growth contributed to our identical sales increase excluding fuel as our sales outpaced the general growth in the food retail industry during 2020 the increase in identical sales excluding fuel was broad based across all supermarket divisions and remained heightened throughout 2020 during the pandemic customers reduced trips while significantly increasing basket value 

​ 

total supermarket fuel sales decreased 325 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 175 and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 182 the decrease in fuel gallons sold was reflective of the national trend which decreased due to the covid19 pandemic the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel

​ 

total sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 by 04 the increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel partially offset by decreased supermarket fuel sales a reduction in convenience store sales due to the sale of our convenience store business unit in the first quarter of 2018 and decreased sales due to the disposal of turkey hill dairy and you technology in the first quarter of 2019 total sales excluding fuel dispositions and the merger with home chef increased 23 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to our merger with home chef and our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 20 identical sales excluding fuel for 2019 compared to 2018 increased primarily due to growth of loyal households a higher customer basket value including retail inflation and kroger specialty pharmacy sales growth partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers 

​ 

total supermarket fuel sales decreased 57 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 48 and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 10 the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel

​ 

we calculate identical sales excluding fuel as sales to retail customers including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations kroger specialty pharmacy businesses and shiptohome solutions we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies our identical sales excluding fuel results are summarized in the following table we used the identical sales excluding fuel dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2020 and 2019

​ 

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2332 in 2020 and 2207 in 2019 the increase in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted primarily from decreased fuel sales which have a lower gross margin rate an increase in our fuel gross margin growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold and decreased shrink transportation and advertising costs as a percentage of sales reflecting the significant increase in sales volumes partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and a change in our product sales mix including lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as delibakery 

​ 

our lifo credit was 7 million in 2020 compared to a lifo charge of 105 million in 2019 our lifo credit was primarily driven by fourth quarter 2020 working capital improvements in pharmacy inventory and dairy deflation 

​ 

our fifo gross margin rate which excludes the lifo charge was 2332 in 2020 compared to 2216 in 2019 our fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel our fifo gross margin rate increased 14 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 this increase resulted primarily from growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold and decreased shrink transportation and advertising costs as a percentage of sales reflecting the significant increase in sales volumes partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and a change in our product sales mix including lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as delibakery

​

operating profit was 28 billion or 210 of sales for 2020 compared to 23 billion or 184 of sales for 2019 operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 due to improved sales to retail customers without fuel a higher gross margin rate decreased rent and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales and increased fuel earnings partially offset by increased oga expense with fuel as a percentage of sales 

​ 

fifo operating profit was 28 billion or 209 of sales for 2020 compared to 24 billion or 193 of sales for 2019 fifo operating profit excluding the 2020 and 2019 adjusted items increased 64 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 due to improved sales to retail customers without fuel a higher gross margin rate decreased rent and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales and increased fuel earnings partially offset by increased oga expense with fuel as a percentage of sales 

​ 

specific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and fifo operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section

 ​ 

interest expense 

​ 

interest expense totaled 544 million in 2020 and 603 million in 2019 the decrease in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted primarily from decreased borrowings over the last 12 months we decreased total debt including obligations under finance leases by 663 million 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective income tax rate was 232 in 2020 and 237 in 2019 the 2020 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions the 2019 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and lucky’s market losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest which reduced pretax income but did not impact tax expense 

​ 

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

​ 

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section

​ 

net earnings were 327 per diluted share for 2020 compared to net earnings of 204 per diluted share for 2019 adjusted net earnings of 347 per diluted share for 2020 represented an increase of 584 compared to adjusted net earnings of 219 per diluted share for 2019 the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from increased fifo operating profit without fuel the decrease in the lifo charge increased fuel earnings and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by a higher income tax expense 

​ 

common share repurchase programs 

​ 

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 12 billion in 2020 and 400 million in 2019 

​ 

in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 128 million in 2020 and 65 million in 2019 of our common shares under the stock option program

​ 

on november 5 2019 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “november 2019 repurchase program” on september 11 2020 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “september 2020 repurchase program” the september 2020 repurchase program authorization replaced the existing november 2019 repurchase program 

​ 

the shares repurchased in 2020 were reacquired under the following share repurchase programs 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of january 30 2021 there was 400 million remaining under the september 2020 repurchase program

​ 

during the first quarter through march 24 2021 we repurchased an additional 36 million of our common shares under the stock option program and 191 million additional shares under the september 2020 repurchase program as of march 24 2021 we have 209 million remaining under the september 2020 repurchase program 

​ 

capital investments 

​ 

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 32 billion in 2020 and 30 billion in 2019 capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 58 million in 2020 and 82 million in 2019 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage

return on invested capital 

​ 

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted roic operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit for roic purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge credit depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv for 2019 an adjustment due to the adoption of asu 201602 “leases” at the beginning of 2019 as further described in notes 10 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes v the average liabilities held for sale and vi certain other adjustments averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets

​ 

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies

​ 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2020 and 2019 on a 52 week basis  in millions the 2019 calculation of roic excludes the financial position and results of operations of you technology and turkey hill dairy due to the sales in 2019 and lucky’s market due to the deconsolidation in 2019 

​ 

 

1 taxes receivable were 66 as of january 30 2021 and 82 as of february 1 2020 we did not have any taxes receivable as of february 2 2019 

2 other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 9 as of january 30 2021 and 60 as of february 2 2019 we did not have any accrued income taxes as of february 1 2020 accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

​ 

critical accounting policies 

​ 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates

​ 

we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain

​ 

impairments of longlived assets 

​ 

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 

​ 

we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 70 million in 2020 in 2019 we recognized an impairment charge related to lucky’s market totaling 238 million the lucky’s market impairment charge consisted of property plant and equipment of 200 million goodwill of 19 million operating lease assets of 11 million and other charges of 8 million additionally we recorded asset impairments totaling 120 million in 2019 including 70 million of operating lease assets this 2019 impairment charge included the 35 planned store closures across our footprint in 2020 related to our transformation efforts we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as oga expense 

​ 

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results

​ 

business combinations 

​ 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting all the assets acquired liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available we use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances including the income approach significant estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill see note 3 for further information about goodwill 

​ 

goodwill 

​ 

our goodwill totaled 31 billion as of january 30 2021 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

​ 

our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter the 2020 fair value of our kroger specialty pharmacy reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach a market multiple model and a comparable mergers and acquisition model market approaches with each method weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on management’s projected future cash flows estimates of revenue growth rates margin assumptions and an appropriate discount rate the market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2020 2019 and 2018 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

​ 

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2020 2019 and 2018 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses

​ 

multiemployer pension plans 

​ 

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans

​ 

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 619 million in 2020 461 million in 2019 and 358 million in 2018 the increase in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 is due to the first quarter 2020 multiemployer pension contribution 

​ 

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these offbalance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds 

​ 

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2020 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer 

​ 

as of december 31 2020 we estimate our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately 17 billion 13 billion net of tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 600 million 500 million net of tax as of december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to higher expected returns on assets in the funds during 2020 restructuring of the national fund and the first quarter 2020 multiemployer pension contribution our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

​ 

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

​ 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made

cash flow information 

​ 

net cash provided by operating activities 

​ 

we generated 68 billion of cash from operations in 2020 compared to 47 billion in 2019 net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted for noncash items and other impacts generated approximately 53 billion of operating cash flow in 2020 compared to 50 billion in 2019 cash provided used by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities including working capital net of effects from mergers and disposals of businesses was 15 billion in 2020 compared to 312 million in 2019 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities including working capital net of effects from mergers and disposals of businesses was primarily due to the following 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

cash paid for taxes decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the payment of taxes on the gain on sale of the you technology and turkey hill dairy businesses in 2019

​ 

cash paid for interest increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the timing of certain semiannual senior note interest payments that were paid during the first quarter of 2020 which were accrued as of the end of fiscal year 2019

​ 

net cash used by investing activities 

​ 

investing activities used cash of 28 billion in 2020 compared to 26 billion in 2019 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 



net cash used by financing activities 

​ 

we used 27 billion of cash for financing activities in 2020 compared to 21 billion during 2019 the amount of cash used for financing activities for 2020 compared to 2019 increased primarily due to increased payments on commercial paper and share repurchases partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and decreased payments on longterm debt 

​ 

debt management 

​ 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of obligations under finance leases decreased 663 million to 134 billion as of yearend 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted primarily from net payments on commercial paper borrowings of 12 billion and payment of 700 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 330 partially offset by the issuance of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 220 the issuance of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 170 and a net increase in obligations under finance leases of 183 million

​ 

dividends

​ 

 ​ 

liquidity needs 

​ 

based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months our liquidity needs include anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments pension plan commitments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2020 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets we have approximately 800 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months 311 million of the employer portion of social security tax payments we have deferred under the cares act that is required to be paid by december 31 2021 and expect to pay approximately 307 million in the first half of 2021 to satisfy a portion of the national fund commitment we expect to satisfy these obligations using cash generated from operations temporary cash investments on hand or through the issuance of additional senior notes or commercial paper we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

​ 

we held cash and temporary cash investments of 17 billion as of the end of 2020 which reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital we remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program and we will evaluate the optimal use of any excess free cash flow consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy 

​ 

the cares act which was enacted on march 27 2020 includes measures to assist companies in response to the covid19 pandemic these measures include deferring the due dates of tax payments and other changes to income and nonincomebased tax laws as permitted under the cares act we are deferring the remittance of the employer portion of the social security tax the social security tax provision requires that the deferred employment tax be paid over two years with half of the amount required to be paid by december 31 2021 and the other half by december 31 2022 during 2020 we deferred the employer portion of social security tax of 622 million of the total 311 million is included in “other current liabilities” and 311 million is included in “other longterm liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets

factors affecting liquidity 

​ 

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at january 30 2021 we had no outstanding commercial paper commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating “public debt rating” means as of any date the rating that has been most recently announced by either sp or moody’s as the case may be for any class of noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by the company as of march 24 2021 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding

​ 

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants are described below

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

our credit facility is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2020

​ 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 30 2021 in millions of dollars

​ 

 

 ​ 

as of january 30 2021 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on august 29 2022 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of january 30 2021 we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 2 million as of january 30 2021 

​ 

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 30 2021 we had authorized for issuance 33 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on may 24 2019

​ 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility

​ 

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities

​ 

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against thirdparty claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

financial risk management 

​ 

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25 of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status

​ 

when we use derivative financial instruments it is primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets as of january 30 2021 we had no forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements outstanding 

​ 

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate

​ 

the tables below provide information about our underlying debt portfolio as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding finance leases as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 we have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 30 2021 or february 1 2020 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend ​ 

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 1 2020 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

​ 

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2019 2018 and 2017 are to the fiscal years ended february 1 2020 february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

​ 

employees 

​ 

as of february 1 2020 kroger employed approximately 435000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 360 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years

​ 

stores 

​ 

as of february 1 2020 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2757 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names of which 2270 had pharmacies and 1567 had fuel centers we offer pickup also referred to as clicklist® and harris teeter expresslane™— personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 1989 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to 97 of kroger households approximately 54 of our supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of real estate our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses

​ 

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 225 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce

​ 

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products and toys

​ 

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

​ 

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

​ 

segments 

​ 

we operate supermarkets and multidepartment stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below

risk factors 

tableend ​ 

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations

​ 

competitive environment 

​ 

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation in addition evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online delivery ship to home and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment  we must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill customer orders providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences if we are not successful in offsetting increased cost of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences our sales and profitability could be adversely affected if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

​ 

we are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats of today – which are product freshness and quality our brands  and personalized rewards – and our competitive moat of tomorrow the seamless ecosystem we are building if we are unable to enhance the foregoing customer connection our ability to compete and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers however we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger  including our alternative profit strategy and our cost savings initiatives which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers our market share and business growth and our operations and results the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability 

​ 

product safety 

​ 

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

labor relations 

​ 

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results

​ 

we are a party to approximately 360 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data and technology 

​ 

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

​ 

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy

​ 

our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control cyberattackers may attempt to access information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information although we have implemented procedures to protect our information and require our vendors to do the same we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against rapidly evolving increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against further a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information in addition hardware software or applications we may use may have inherent defects or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security 

​ 

our continued investment in our information technology systems may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks breaches or disruptions to our business operations which could result in a loss of customers or business information negative publicity damage to our reputation and exposure to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance in addition compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyberattacks are significant following a cyberattack  our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberattack could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands reputation business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business our business depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations or cash flows large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ information there can be no assurance that such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated

​ 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to among other things systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act ccpa our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of noncompliance 

​ 

payment systems 

​ 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks and select credit and debit cards as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

​ 

indebtedness 

​ 

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure

​ 

legal proceedings and insurance 

​ 

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

multiemployer pension obligations 

​ 

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably or adjust their current views unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

​ 

we also currently bear the investment risk of two multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

integration of new business and strategic alliances 

​ 

we enter into mergers acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies capital requirements and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

fuel 

​ 

we sell a significant amount of fuel which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism disruptions to the economy including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

economic conditions 

​ 

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism or pandemics such as the spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

weather and natural disasters 

​ 

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

covid19 

​ 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization announced that infections of the coronavirus covid19 had become a pandemic and on march 13 the us president announced a national emergency relating to the disease there is a possibility of widespread infection in the united states and abroad with the potential for catastrophic impact national state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population including mandatory business closures these measures while intended to protect human life are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries is uncertain some economists are predicting the united states may enter a recession as a result of the pandemic 

​ 

our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine as a result of the coronavirus pandemic these impacts include but are not limited to 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

any of the foregoing factors or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our sales and damage the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flows and its liquidity position possibly to a significant degree the duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the sweeping nature of the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

government regulation 

​ 

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages and new provisions relating to the covid19 pandemic we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

properties 

tableend ​ 

as of february 1 2020 we operated approximately 2800 owned or leased supermarkets distribution warehouses and food production plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of real estate a substantial portion of the properties used to conduct our business are leased

​ 

we generally own store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and food production equipment the total cost of our owned assets and finance leases at february 1 2020 was 458 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 240 billion

​ 

we lease certain store real estate warehouses distribution centers office space and equipment while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate we operate in leased facilities in approximately half of our store locations lease terms generally range from 10 to 20 years with options to renew for varying terms at our sole discretion certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet certain leases include escalation clauses or payment of executory costs such as property taxes utilities or insurance and maintenance rent expense for leases with escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straightline basis over the lease term our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants certain properties or portions thereof are subleased to others for periods generally ranging from one to 20 years for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 3 

legal proceedings 

tableend ​ 

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

use of nongaap financial measures 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including fifo gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 

​ 

we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness

​ 

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness 

  

the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate yearoveryear comparisons for our net earnings and net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations net earnings for 2019 include the following which we define as the “2019 adjusted items” 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

net earnings for 2018 include the following which we define as the “2018 adjusted items”

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

net earnings for 2017 include the following which we define as the “2017 adjusted items”

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

in addition net earnings for 2017 include 119 million 79 million net of tax due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2017 the “extra week”

​

covid19 

​ 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization announced that infections of the coronavirus covid19 had become a pandemic and on march 13 the us president announced a national emergency relating to the disease there is a possibility of widespread infection in the united states and abroad with the potential for catastrophic impact national state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population including mandatory business closures these measures while intended to protect human life are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries is uncertain some economists are predicting the united states may enter a recession as a result of the pandemic 

​ 

we expect the ultimate significance of the impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic and any governmental and public actions taken in response covid19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses particularly over the near term 

​ 

on april 1 2020 we issued a press release announcing business updates in response to the impact from novel coronavirus covid19

total sales 

 in millions

 

 ​ 

total sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 by 04 the increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel partially offset by decreased supermarket fuel sales a reduction in convenience store sales due to the sale of our convenience store business unit in the first quarter of 2018 and decreased sales due to the disposal of turkey hill dairy and you technology in the first quarter of 2019 total sales excluding fuel dispositions and the merger with home chef increased 23 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to our merger with home chef and our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 20 identical sales excluding fuel for 2019 compared to 2018 increased primarily due to growth of loyal households a higher customer basket value including retail inflation and kroger specialty pharmacy sales growth partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers total supermarket fuel sales decreased 57 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 48 and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 10 the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel 

​ 

total sales decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by 12 the decrease in total sales in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to the extra week in 2017 partially offset by the increase in 2018 sales compared to 2017 adjusted sales total sales increased in 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted sales by 07 this increase was primarily due to our increases in total sales to retail customers without fuel and supermarket fuel sales partially offset by a reduction in convenience store sales due to the sale of our convenience store business unit in the first quarter of 2018 the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted sales to retail customers without fuel was primarily due to our merger with home chef and our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 18 identical sales excluding fuel for 2018 compared to 2017 increased primarily due to a higher customer basket value and kroger specialty pharmacy sales growth partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers total supermarket fuel sales increased 155 in 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted supermarket fuel sales primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 136 and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 15 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

​ 

we calculate identical sales excluding fuel as sales to retail customers including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations kroger specialty pharmacy businesses and shiptohome solutions we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters additionally sales from all acquired businesses are treated as identical as if they were part of the company in the prior year products and services related primarily to kroger personal finance which were historically accounted for as an offset to oga are classified as a component of sales as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019 these prioryear amounts have been reclassified to conform to currentyear presentation which is consistent with our restock kroger initiative and our view of the products and services as part of our core business strategy this is also more consistent with industry practice these kroger personal finance transactions represent sales to retail customers and as such are included in identical sales in 2019 and 2018 this change did not affect identical sales percentages for 2018 see “supplemental information” section below for more detail on the changes and the impact of the reclassification although identical sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies our identical sales results are summarized in the following table we used the identical sales dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2019

​ 

identical sales 

 in millions

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

gross margin lifo and fifo gross margin 

​ 

we define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in gross margin

​ 

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2207 in 2019 and 2195 in 2018 the increase in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales decreased shrink as a percentage of sales growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio and effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold partially offset by industrywide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy continued investments in lower prices for our customers a higher lifo charge and continued growth in the specialty pharmacy business 

​ 

our lifo charge was 105 million in 2019 and 29 million in 2018 our lifo charge reflects an increase in our product cost inflation for 2019 driven by dry grocery pharmacy and dairy 

​ 

our fifo gross margin rate which excludes the lifo charge was 2216 in 2019 compared to 2198 for 2018 our fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel our fifo gross margin rate decreased 23 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 this decrease resulted primarily from industrywide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy continued investments in lower prices for our customers and continued growth in the specialty pharmacy business partially offset by decreased shrink as a percentage of sales growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio and effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold 

​ 

operating general and administrative expenses 

​ 

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages healthcare benefit costs retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga

​ 

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1734 in 2019 and 1706 in 2018 the increase in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from the 2019 oga adjusted items the effect of decreased supermarket fuel and convenience store sales which increases our oga rate as a percentage of sales investments in our digital strategy and increases in hourly associate labor costs the increase in hourly associate labor costs is attributable to investing in higher wages and other comprehensive benefits to improve employee retention engagement and customer experience the increase was partially offset by the 2018 oga adjusted items broad based improvement of restock kroger cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies store productivity and sourcing cost reductions decreased incentive plan and healthcare costs and planned real estate transactions during the first quarter of 2019 

​ 

excluding the effect of fuel the 2019 oga adjusted items and the 2018 oga adjusted items our oga rate decreased 29 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 this decrease resulted primarily from broad based improvement of restock kroger cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies store productivity and sourcing cost reductions decreased incentive plan and healthcare costs and planned real estate transactions during the first quarter of 2019 the decrease was partially offset by investments in our digital strategy and increases in hourly associate labor costs attributed to investing in higher wages and other comprehensive benefits to improve employee retention engagement and customer experience 

​ 

during the second quarter of 2019 we accepted an offer to sell an unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time we used this gain as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the united food and commercial workers “ufcw” consolidated pension plan helping stabilize associates’ future benefits the net impact of these transactions had no effect to oga for 2019

​ 

rent expense 

​ 

rent expense as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent in 2019 compared to 2018

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2019 compared to 2018 this increase is primarily due to the 2018 depreciation adjusted item additional depreciation on capital investments excluding mergers and lease buyouts of 30 billion during 2019 and a decrease in the average useful life on these capital investments as we are investing more in technology projects and our digital ecosystem

​ 

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

​ 

operating profit was 23 billion or 184 of sales for 2019 compared to 26 billion or 215 of sales for 2018 operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 31 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased oga and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by a higher gross margin rate

​ 

fifo operating profit was 24 billion or 193 of sales for 2019 compared to 26 billion or 217 of sales for 2018 fifo operating profit excluding the 2019 and 2018 adjusted items was 30 billion or 245 of sales for 2019 compared to 29 billion or 236 of sales for 2018 fifo operating profit excluding the 2019 and 2018 adjusted items increased 9 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased fuel earnings improved sales to retail customers without fuel and decreased oga expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by decreased pharmacy gross profit and increased depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales 

​ 

specific factors contributing to the operating trends for operating profit and fifo operating profit above are discussed earlier in this section

​ 

the following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to fifo operating profit excluding the 2019 and 2018 adjusted items

​ 

operating profit excluding the adjusted items 

 in millions

​ 

 

 ​ 

interest expense 

​ 

interest expense totaled 603 million in 2019 and 620 million in 2018 the decrease in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from decreased borrowings and a lower weighted average interest rate over the last 12 months we decreased total debt including obligations under finance leases by 12 billion 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective income tax rate was 237 in 2019 and 226 in 2018 the 2019 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and lucky’s market losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest which reduced pretax income but did not impact tax expense these 2019 items were partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions the 2018 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and an irs audit that resulted in a reduction of prior year tax deductions at pretax act rates and an increase in future tax deductions at posttax act rates these 2018 items were partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions and adjustments to provisional amounts that increased prior year deductions at pretax act rates and decreased future deductions at posttax act rates 

​ 

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

​ 

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section

​ 

net earnings were 204 per diluted share for 2019 compared to net earnings of 376 per diluted share for 2018 adjusted net earnings of 219 per diluted share for 2019 represented an increase of 38 compared to adjusted net earnings of 211 per diluted share for 2018 the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from increased fuel earnings decreased interest expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by increased tax expense and a higher lifo charge 

​ 

common share repurchase programs 

​ 

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 400 million in 2019 and 727 million in 2018 on april 20 2018 we entered and funded a 12 billion asr program to reacquire shares in privately negotiated transactions 

​ 

in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 65 million in 2019 and 83 million in 2018 of our common shares under the stock option program

​ 

on march 15 2018 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions including accelerated stock repurchase transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “march 2018 repurchase program” on november 5 2019 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “november 2019 repurchase program” the november 2019 repurchase program authorization replaced the existing march 2018 repurchase program that had approximately 546 million remaining

​ 

the shares repurchased in 2019 were reacquired under the following share repurchase programs 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of february 1 2020 there was 600 million remaining under the november 2019 repurchase program

​ 

during the first quarter through march 25 2020 we repurchased an additional 39 million of our common shares under the stock option program and 355 million additional shares under the november 2019 repurchase program as of march 25 2020 we have 245 million remaining under the november 2019 repurchase program to maintain financial flexibility we have decided to pause on additional share repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 

​ 

capital investments 

​ 

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 30 billion in 2019 and 2018 capital investments for mergers were 197 million in 2018 related to the merger with home chef refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these mergers capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 82 million in 2019 and 5 million in 2018 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage

​ 

supermarket storing activity 

​ 

 ​ 

return on invested capital 

​ 

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted roic operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit for roic purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization iv for 2018 a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight and v for 2019 an adjustment due to the adoption of asu 201602 “leases” at the beginning of 2019 as further described in notes 10 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes v the average liabilities held for sale and vi certain other adjustments averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two for 2018 we used a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets

​ 

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies

​ 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2019 and 2018 on a 52 week basis  in millions the 2019 calculation of roic excludes the financial position and results of operations of you technology and turkey hill dairy due to the sales in 2019 and lucky’s market due to the deconsolidation in 2019 the 2018 calculation of roic excludes the financial position and results of operations of home chef due to the merger in 2018 and the convenience store business due to the sale in 2018 

​ 

 

1 taxes receivable were 82 as of february 1 2020 and 229 as of february 3 2018 we did not have any taxes receivable as of february 2 2019 

2 other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 60 as of february 2 2019 we did not have any accrued income taxes as of february 1 2020 or february 3 2018 accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

​ 

critical accounting policies 

​ 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates

​ 

we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain

​ 

impairments of longlived assets 

​ 

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 

​ 

as discussed previously in the overview section we recognized an impairment charge related to lucky’s market in the third quarter of 2019 totaling 238 million the lucky’s market impairment charge consists of property plant and equipment of 200 million goodwill of 19 million operating lease assets of 11 million and other charges of 8 million additionally we recorded asset impairments totaling 120 million in 2019 including 70 million of operating lease assets this 2019 impairment charge includes the 35 planned store closures across our footprint in 2020 related to our restock kroger transformation efforts we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 56 million in 2018 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as oga expense 

​ 

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results

​ 

business combinations 

​ 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting all the assets acquired liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available we use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances including the income approach significant estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill see note 3 for further information about goodwill 

​ 

goodwill 

​ 

our goodwill totaled 31 billion as of february 1 2020 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

​ 

our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter in 2017 we recorded goodwill impairment for our kroger specialty pharmacy “ksp” reporting unit totaling 110 million 74 million net of tax resulting in a remaining goodwill balance of 243 million the 2019 fair value of our ksp reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach a market multiple model and a comparable mergers and acquisition model market approaches with each method weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on management’s projected future cash flows estimates of revenue growth rates margin assumptions and an appropriate discount rate the market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2019 and 2018 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

​ 

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2019 2018 and 2017 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses

​ 

multiemployer pension plans 

​ 

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans

​ 

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 461 million in 2019 358 million in 2018 and 954 million in 2017 the increase in 2017 compared to 2019 and 2018 is due to the 467 million pretax payment we made in 2017 to satisfy withdrawal obligations for certain local unions of the central states pension fund and the 2017 ufcw contribution 

​ 

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these offbalance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets we became the fiduciary of the ibt consolidated pension fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the ibt that provided for the withdrawal of certain local unions from the central states pension fund significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2019 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 we estimate our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately 23 billion 18 billion net of tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 800 million 600 million net of tax as of december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to higher expected returns on assets in the funds during 2019 our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

​ 

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

​ 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made

cash flow information 

​ 

net cash provided by operating activities 

​ 

we generated 47 billion of cash from operations in 2019 compared to 42 billion in 2018 net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted for noncash items and other impacts generated approximately 49 billion of operating cash flow in 2019 compared to 38 billion in 2018 cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 259 million in 2019 compared to 395 million in 2018 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

cash paid for taxes increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the payment of estimated taxes on the gain on sale of the you technology and turkey hill dairy businesses in 2019 and an overpayment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated taxes that resulted in lower tax payments in 2018

​ 

cash paid for interest decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest related to certain semiannual senior notes interest payments that were paid subsequent to february 1 2020

​ 

net cash used by investing activities 

​ 

investing activities used cash of 26 billion in 2019 compared to 12 billion in 2018 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

net cash used by financing activities 

​ 

we used 21 billion of cash for financing activities in 2019 compared to 29 billion during 2018 the amount of cash used for financing activities for 2019 compared to 2018 decreased primarily due to decreased payments on commercial paper and share repurchases partially offset by increased payments on longterm debt including obligations under finance leases and a reduction of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

​ 

debt management 

​ 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of obligations under finance leases decreased 12 billion to 141 billion as of yearend 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from payment of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 150 payment of 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 615 and the repayment of our 10 billion term loan partially offset by the issuance of 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 395 and an increase in outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 350 million at the end of 2019 compared to 2018

​ 

dividends 

​ 

the following table provides dividend information  in millions except per share amounts

​ 

 ​ 

liquidity needs 

​ 

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to approximate 55 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2019 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 700 million of senior notes and 12 billion of commercial paper maturing in fiscal year 2020 which are included in the 55 billion of estimated liquidity needs we expect to satisfy these obligations using cash generated from operations and through issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions

​ 

factors affecting liquidity 

​ 

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at february 1 2020 we had 12 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating “public debt rating” means as of any date the rating that has been most recently announced by either sp or moody’s as the case may be for any class of noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by the company on march 18 2020 we proactively borrowed 1 billion from our revolving credit facility this was a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility reduce reliance on the commercial paper market and maintain liquidity in response to the coronavirus pandemic cash and temporary cash investments immediately following the borrowing were approximately 23 billion as of march 25 2020 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

​ 

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants are described below

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

our credit facility is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2019

​ 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 1 2020 in millions of dollars

​ 

 

1 the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 34 million in 2019 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 461 million in 2019 this table also excludes the march 18 2020 1 billion borrowing under our revolving credit facility since the borrowing occurred subsequent to february 1 2020 

2 the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined

3 as of february 1 2020 we had 12 billion of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility

4 amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february 1 2020 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments

5 the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability related to workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis

6 amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

7 amounts include commitments many of which are shortterm in nature to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

as of february 1 2020 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on august 29 2022 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of february 1 2020 we had 12 billion of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 2 million as of february 1 2020 

​ 

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 1 2020 we had authorized for issuance 43 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on may 24 2019

​ 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility

​ 

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities

​ 

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

financial risk management 

​ 

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

​ 

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25 of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status

​ 

as of february 1 2020 we maintained seven forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of january 15 2021 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 350 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in january 2021 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 157 to 245 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 1 2020 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in “other longterm liabilities” for 19 million and accumulated other comprehensive loss for 17 million net of tax 

​ 

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate

​ 

the tables below provide information about our underlying debt portfolio as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding finance leases as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 we have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1 2020 or february 2 2019 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

​

based on our yearend 2019 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies

 item 1 business 

  

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 2 2019 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2018 2017 and 2016 are to the fiscal years ended february 2 2019 february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

employees 

  

as of february 2 2019 kroger employed approximately 453000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 360 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

stores 

  

as of february 2 2019 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2764 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names of which 2270 had pharmacies and 1537 had fuel centers we offer pickup also referred to as clicklist® and harris teeter expresslane™— personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 1581 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to 91 of kroger households approximately 54 of our supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of real estate our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 25 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

 

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products and toys 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

segments 

  

we operate supermarkets and multidepartment stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

our brands products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock over 15000 private label items our brands products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection® is one of our premium quality brands offering customers culinary foods and ingredients that deliver amazing eating experiences the kroger® brand which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to consistently satisfy and delight customers with quality products that exceed or meet the national brand in taste and efficacy as well as with unique and differentiated products big k® check this out…® and heritage farm® are some of our value brands designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition we continue to grow natural and organic our brands offerings with simple truth® and simple truth organic® both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from a defined list of artificial ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 32 of our brands units and 43 of the grocery category our brands units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants the remaining our brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers we perform a “make or buy” analysis on our brands products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of february 2 2019 we operated 37 food production plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies 10 deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants one meat plant and two cheese plants 

  

seasonality 

  

the majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year additionally significant inclement weather systems particularly winter storms tend to affect our sales trends 

 

executive officers of the registrant 

  

the disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth in item 10 of part iii of this form 10k under the heading “executive officers of the company” and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

competitive environment 

  

for the disclosure related to our competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k which include forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation in addition evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online delivery ship to home and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment 

  

we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers however we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger  including our alternative profit strategy and our cost savings initiatives which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers our market share and business growth and our operations and results the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 360 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy 

  

our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control cyberattackers may attempt to access information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information although we have implemented procedures to protect our information and require our vendors to do the same we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against rapidly evolving increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against further a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information in addition hardware software or applications we may use may have inherent defects or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security 

  

our continued investment in our information technology systems may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks breaches or disruptions to our business operations which could result in a loss of customers or business information negative publicity damage to our reputation and exposure to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance in addition compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues 

  

additionally on october 1 2015 the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv transactions we completed the implementation of the emv technology for our supermarket transactions and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers which will occur in 2020 

  

indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings and insurance 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably or adjust their current views unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of two multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

integration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

  

fuel 

  

we sell a significant amount of fuel which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

economic conditions 

  

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 2 properties 

  

as of february 2 2019 we operated approximately 2800 owned or leased supermarkets distribution warehouses and food production plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of real estate a substantial portion of the properties used to conduct our business are leased 

  

we generally own store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and food production equipment the total cost of our owned assets and capitalized leases at february 2 2019 was 439 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 222 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution food production and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and the “outlook” section below 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 2 2019 kroger is one of the world’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2764 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the district of columbia of these stores 2270 have pharmacies and 1537 have fuel centers we offer pickup also referred to as clicklist® and harris teeter expresslane™ — personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 1581 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to 91 of kroger households we also operate an online retailer 

  

we operate 37 food production plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 32 of our brands units and 43 of the grocery category our brands units sold in our supermarkets the remaining our brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment 

  

on june 22 2018 we closed our merger with home chef by purchasing 100 of the ownership interest in home chef for 197 million net of cash and cash equivalents of 30 million in addition to future earnout payments of up to 500 million over five years that are contingent on achieving certain milestones home chef is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet for 2018 and in our consolidated statements of operations from june 22 2018 through february 2 2019 

  

on april 20 2018 we completed the sale of our convenience store business unit for 22 billion the convenience store business is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet for 2017 and in our consolidated statements of operations in all periods in 2016 and 2017 and through april 19 2018 

  

on september 2 2016 we closed our merger with modern hc holdings inc “modernhealth” by purchasing 100 of the outstanding shares of modernhealth for 407 million modernhealth is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet for 2016 2017 and 2018 and in our consolidated statements of operations from september 2 2016 through january 28 2017 and all periods in 2017 and 2018 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our mergers with home chef and modernhealth 

  

use of nongaap financial measures   

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted operating net earnings adjusted operating net earnings per diluted share and restock cash flow because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings net earnings per diluted share and net cash provided or used by operating or investing activities or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 

 

we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management as management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness 

  

the adjusted operating net earnings and adjusted operating net earnings per diluted share metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods we believe adjusted operating net earnings and adjusted operating net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate yearoveryear comparisons for our net earnings and net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations net earnings for 2018 include the following which we define as the “2018 adjusted items” 

  



  



  



  

net earnings for 2017 include the following which we define as the “2017 adjusted items” 

  



  



  



  



  

in addition net earnings for 2017 include 119 million 79 million net of tax due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2017 the “extra week” 

  

net earnings for 2016 include 111 million 71 million net of tax of charges to oga related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits the “2016 adjusted items”

total sales decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by 12 the decrease in total sales in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to the extra week in 2017 partially offset by the increase in 2018 sales compared to 2017 adjusted sales total sales increased in 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted sales by 06 this increase was primarily due to our increases in total sales to retail customers without fuel and supermarket fuel sales partially offset by a reduction in convenience store sales due to the sale of our convenience store business unit the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted sales to retail customers without fuel was primarily due to our merger with home chef and our identical sales increase excluding fuel of 18 identical sales excluding fuel for 2018 compared to 2017 increased primarily due to changes in product mix including higher quality products at a higher price point and kroger specialty pharmacy sales growth partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers total supermarket fuel sales increased 155 in 2018 compared to 2017 adjusted supermarket fuel sales primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 136 and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 15 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

 

total sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 by 64 the increase in total sales in 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the increase in adjusted sales and the extra week total adjusted sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 by 44 this increase was primarily due to our increases in total sales to retail customers without fuel and supermarket fuel sales the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2017 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2016 was primarily due to our merger with modernhealth identical sales increase excluding fuel of 09 and an increase in supermarket square footage identical sales excluding fuel for 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us changes in product mix kroger specialty pharmacy sales growth and product cost inflation of 07 partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers excluding mergers acquisitions and operational closings total supermarket square footage at the end of 2017 increased 19 over the end of 2016 total adjusted supermarket fuel sales increased 144 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 123 and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 19 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

  

we calculate identical sales excluding fuel as sales to retail customers including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations kroger specialty pharmacy businesses and shiptohome solutions we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters additionally sales from all acquired businesses are treated as identical as if they were part of the company in the prior year although identical sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies certain pharmacy fees recorded as a reduction of sales have been comparatively reflected in the identical sales calculation our identical sales results are summarized in the following table we used the identical sales dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2018 

  

identical sales 

 in millions 

  







  

gross margin lifo and fifo gross margin 

  

we define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in gross margin 

  

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2168 in 2018 2201 in 2017 and 2240 in 2016 the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers a higher lifo charge a change in product sales mix and increased transportation and advertising costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by growth in our brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products improved merchandise costs decreased shrink as a percentage of sales and a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales 

  

the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and our merger with modernhealth due to its lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing transportation and shrink costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by improved merchandise costs a lower lifo charge a change in our product sales mix including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales growth in our brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products decreased advertising costs as a percentage of sales and a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales 

 

our lifo charge for 2018 was 29 million compared to a lifo credit of 8 million in 2017 and a lifo charge of 19 million in 2016 in 2018 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation primarily related to pharmacy our lifo credit in 2017 was primarily due to a reduction of pharmacy inventory in 2017 compared to 2016 in 2016 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation in other departments 

  

our fifo gross margin rates which exclude the lifo charges and credit were 2170 in 2018 2201 in 2017 and 2242 in 2016 our fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel and the extra week our fifo gross margin rate decreased 55 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 this decrease resulted primarily from our lower gross margin rate excluding the effect of the lifo charge and fuel which has been described above 

  

excluding the effect of fuel the extra week and modernhealth our fifo gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 this decrease resulted primarily from our lower gross margin rate excluding the effect of the lifo credit and charge fuel and modernhealth which has been described above 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages healthcare benefit costs and retirement plan costs and utility and credit card fees certain other income items are classified as a reduction of oga expenses these items include gift card and lottery commissions coupon processing and vending machine fees check cashing money order and wire transfer fees and baled salvage credits rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1676 in 2018 1715 in 2017 and 1661 in 2016 the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from effective cost controls due to process changes decreased utilities the 2017 oga adjusted items and our incremental contribution of 111 million 69 million net of tax to the united food and commercial workers “ufcw” consolidated pension plan in 2017 “2017 ufcw contribution” partially offset by the 2018 oga adjusted items investments in our digital strategy and increased incentive plan costs our fuel sales lower our oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel the extra week the 2018 oga adjusted items the 2017 oga adjusted items and the 2017 ufcw contribution our oga rate increased 14 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 this increase resulted primarily from investments in our digital strategy and increased incentive plan costs partially offset by effective cost controls due to process changes and decreased utilities 

  

the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from the 2017 oga adjusted items investing in our digital strategy increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention employee engagement and customer experience the 2017 ufcw contribution increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs partially offset by savings from the vro effective cost controls higher fuel sales the 2016 adjusted items and our merger with modernhealth due to its lower oga rate as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of fuel the extra week the 2017 ufcw contribution the 2017 oga and 2016 adjusted items and modernhealth our oga rate increased 21 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase resulted primarily from investing in our digital strategy increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention employee engagement and customer experience increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs partially offset by savings from the vro and effective cost controls 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased closed store liabilities rent expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 due to our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and higher fuel sales which decreases our rent expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by increased closed store liabilities 

 

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the extra week and additional depreciation on capital investments excluding mergers and lease buyouts of 30 billion during 2018 partially offset by higher fuel sales which decreases our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher fuel sales which decreases our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales the extra week and the 2017 depreciation adjusted item partially offset by additional depreciation on capital investments excluding mergers and lease buyouts of 30 billion during 2017 

  

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 26 billion in 2018 26 billion in 2017 and 35 billion in 2016 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 216 in 2018 213 in 2017 and 299 in 2016 operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased oga and rent expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by a lower gross margin rate increased depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher lifo charge as a percentage of sales 

  

operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 86 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a lower gross margin and increased oga expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and rent expenses and a lower lifo charge as a percentage of sales 

  

fifo operating profit was 26 billion in 2018 26 billion in 2017 and 35 billion in 2016 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 218 in 2018 212 in 2017 and 301 in 2016 fuel sales lower our operating profit rate due to the very low operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the extra week the 2017 ufcw contribution and the 2018 and 2017 adjusted items decreased 68 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a lower gross margin and increased oga and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower rent expense as a percentage of sales 

  

fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the extra week the 2017 ufcw contribution the 2017 and 2016 adjusted items and modernhealth decreased 45 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a lower gross margin and increased oga and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales  

  

specific factors of the above operating trends under operating profit and fifo operating profit are discussed earlier in this section 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 620 million in 2018 601 million in 2017 and 522 million in 2016 the increase in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases the extra week the 12 billion we contributed to companysponsored and companymanaged pension plans in 2017 a 467 million pretax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations for certain local unions of the central states pension fund partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate 

 

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 226 in 2018 273 in 2017 and 328 in 2016 the 2018 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and an irs audit that resulted in a reduction of prior year tax deductions at pretax act rates and an increase in future tax deductions at posttax act rates these 2018 items were partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions and adjustments to provisional amounts that increased prior year deductions at pretax act rates and decreased future deductions at posttax act rates the 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the tax act the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by nondeducible goodwill impairment charges and the effect of state income taxes the 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments after the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

  

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

  

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section 

  

net earnings of 376 per diluted share in 2018 represented an increase of 799 from net earnings of 209 per diluted share in 2017 adjusted operating net earnings of 211 per diluted share in 2018 represented an increase of 82 from adjusted operating net earnings of 195 per diluted share in 2017 the 82 increase in adjusted operating net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from lower income tax expense higher fuel earnings and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by lower nonfuel fifo operating profit a higher lifo charge and increased interest expense 

  

net earnings of 209 per diluted share in 2017 represented an increase of 20 from net earnings of 205 per diluted share in 2016 adjusted operating net earnings of 195 per diluted share in 2017 represented a decrease of 80 from adjusted operating net earnings of 212 per diluted share in 2016 the 80 decrease in adjusted operating net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from lower nonfuel fifo operating profit and increased interest expense partially offset by higher fuel earnings a lower lifo charge decreased income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases  

  

common share repurchase programs 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 727 million in 2018 16 billion in 2017 and 17 billion in 2016 on april 20 2018 we entered and funded a 12 billion asr program to reacquire shares in privately negotiated transactions 

  

in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 83 million in 2018 66 million in 2017 and 105 million in 2016 of our common shares under the stock option program 

  

the shares repurchased in 2018 were reacquired under two separate share repurchase programs the first is a series of board of director authorizations 

  



  



 



  

as of february 2 2019 there was 546 million remaining under the march 2018 repurchase program 

  

the second share repurchase program is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in kroger’s stock option longterm incentive plans and the associated tax benefits 

  

during the first quarter through march 28 2019 we repurchased an additional 9 million of our common shares under the stock option program and no additional shares under the march 2018 repurchase program as of march 28 2019 we have 546 million remaining under the march 2018 repurchase program

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes and v the average liabilities held for sale averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2018 and 2017 on a 52 week basis  in millions the 2018 calculation of roic excludes the financial position and results of operations of home chef due to the merger in 2018 and the convenience store business due to the sale in 2018 

  







  

restock cash flow 

  

restock cash flow is an adjusted free cash flow measure calculated as net cash provided by operating activities minus net cash used by investing activities plus or minus adjustments for certain items we updated our definition of restock cash flow during 2018 to more closely align with the performance metrics under our restock kroger plan restock cash flow is an important measure used by management to evaluate available funding for dividends managing debt levels share repurchases and other strategic investments management believes restock cash flow is a useful metric to investors and analysts to demonstrate our available funding for dividends managing debt levels share repurchases and other strategic investments 

 

the following table provides a calculation of restock cash flow for 2018 and 2017  in millions 

  



  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 56 million in 2018 71 million in 2017 and 26 million in 2016 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

 

business combinations 

  

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting all the assets acquired liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available we use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances primarily including the income approach significant estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill see note 3 for further information about goodwill 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 31 billion as of february 2 2019 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

  

our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter in 2017 we recorded goodwill impairment for our kroger specialty pharmacy “ksp” reporting unit totaling 110 million 74 million net of tax resulting in a remaining goodwill balance of 243 million the 2018 fair value of our ksp reporting unit was estimated primarily based on a discounted cash flow model resulting in a percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 3 the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2018 and 2016 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance except for our ksp reporting unit 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2018 2017 and 2016 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses 

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 358 million in 2018 954 million in 2017 and 289 million in 2016 the increase in 2017 compared to 2018 and 2016 is due to the 467 million pretax payment we made in 2017 to satisfy withdrawal obligations for certain local unions of the central states pension fund and the 2017 ufcw contribution 

 

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these offbalance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets we became the fiduciary of the ibt consolidated pension fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the ibt that provided for the withdrawal of certain local unions from the central states pension fund significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are 

  



  



  



  



  

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2018 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer 

  

as of december 31 2018 we estimate our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or as it relates to certain funds an estimated withdrawal liability was approximately 31 billion 24 billion net of tax this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 800 million 600 million net of tax as of december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 the increase in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to lower expected returns on assets in the funds our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we adopted asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” asu 201704 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test asu 201704 requires applying a onestep quantitative test and recording the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit asu 201704 does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with this standard which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge in 2017 of 110 million 74 million net of tax related to our kroger specialty pharmacy reporting unit 

  

on february 4 2018 we adopted asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which superseded previous revenue recognition guidance topic 606 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue when goods and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that is proportionate to what has been delivered at that point and that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods or services we adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach with the adoption primarily involving the evaluation of whether we act as principal or agent in certain vendor arrangements where the purchase and sale of inventory are virtually simultaneous we will continue to record revenue and related costs on a gross basis for the arrangements the adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

in march 2017 the financial accounting standard’s board “fasb” issued asu compensation  retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost asu 201707” asu 201707 requires an employer to report the service cost component of retiree benefits in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations we adopted asu 201707 on february 4 2018 and retrospectively applied it to all periods presented as a result retiree benefit plan interest expense investment returns settlements and other nonservice cost components of retiree benefit expenses are excluded from our operating profit subtotal as reported in our consolidated statements of operations but remain included in net earnings before income tax expense due to the adoption we reclassified 527 million for 2017 and 16 million for 2016 of nonservice companysponsored pension plan costs from operating profit to other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations information about retiree benefit plans interest expense investment returns and other components of retiree benefit expenses can be found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2016 the fasb issued “financial instruments–overall topic 825” which updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments asu 201601 we adopted this asu on february 4 2018 as a result of the adoption we recorded a mark to market gain on ocado securities for those securities we owned as of the end of 2018 within the consolidated statements of operations as opposed to a component of other comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements the standard’s core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding rightofuse assets leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february 1 2020 we will apply the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the standard which allows us to carryforward our historical lease classification and will apply the transition option which does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption we estimate adoption of the standard will result in recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities of approximately 67 billion as of february 3 2019 when combined with our existing capital leases our total lease assets will be approximately 74 billion and our total lease liabilities will be approximately 76 billion as of february 3 2019 we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings or cash flows we believe our current offbalance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating 

  

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” asu 201802 amends asc 220 “income statement  reporting comprehensive income” to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act in addition under asu 201802 we may be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects asu 201802 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 42 billion of cash from operations in 2018 compared to 34 billion in 2017 and 43 billion in 2016 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests a decrease in the noncash adjustment for deferred income taxes positive changes in working capital and reduced contributions to the company sponsored pension plans partially offset by noncash adjustments for the expense for companysponsored pension plans the gain on sale of our convenience store business unit and the mark to market gain on ocado securities 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests the 10 billion contribution to the companysponsored defined benefit plans and deferred taxes partially offset by an increase in noncash expenses and changes in working capital deferred taxes changed in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the tax act 

  

cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 580 million in 2018 164 million in 2017 and 492 million in 2016 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the following 

  



  



  



  



  



 



  

the decrease in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  

cash paid for taxes increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the payment of estimated taxes on the gain on sale of our convenience store business unit and lower estimated tax payments in 2017 due to the 1 billion 650 million net of tax pension contribution made in 2017 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 12 billion in 2018 27 billion in 2017 and 39 billion in 2016 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of our convenience store business unit partially offset by the payment for our merger with home chef and the purchases of ocado securities the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reduced cash payments for capital investments and lower payments for mergers 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

cash used by financing activities was 29 billion in 2018 681 million in 2017 and 352 million in 2016 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased payments on longterm debt and commercial paper and increased share repurchases partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of longterm debt we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our convenience store business unit to pay down outstanding commercial paper borrowings and fund a 12 billion asr program which was completed in the second quarter of 2018 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net longterm borrowings partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases and higher net commercial paper borrowings 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations decreased 360 million to 152 billion as of yearend 2018 compared to 2017 the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from net payments on commercial paper borrowings of 13 billion and payments of 13 billion on maturing longterm debt obligations partially offset by the issuance of i 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 450 ii 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 540 and iii our 10 billion term loan that has a variable interest rate the variable interest rate on the term loan was 337 as of february 2 2019 the combined 12 billion senior notes issuance has a higher weighted average interest rate than the 13 billion maturing longterm debt obligations it replaced as a result we expect a higher weighted average interest rate in 2019 which may contribute to increased interest expense the sale of our convenience store business unit allowed us to pay down debt and fund our asr program 

 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 15 billion to 156 billion as of yearend 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted from the issuance of i 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 280 ii 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 370 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 465 and iv increases in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by payments of 700 million on maturing longterm debt obligations 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to approximate 64 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2018 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 13 billion of senior notes 800 million of commercial paper and the 10 billion term loan maturing in the next twelve months which are included in the 64 billion of estimated liquidity needs we expect to satisfy these obligations using cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of our you technology and turkey hill dairy businesses and through issuing additional senior notes a term loan or commercial paper on march 15 2019 we repaid our 10 billion term loan through increased commercial paper borrowings which have a lower interest rate we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at february 2 2019 we had 800 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating “public debt rating” means as of any date the rating that has been most recently announced by either sp or moody’s as the case may be for any class of noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by the company as of march 28 2019 we had 810 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants are described below 

  



  



  

our credit facility is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2018 

 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 2 2019 in millions of dollars 

  

















  

as of february 2 2019 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on august 29 2022 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility the commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of february 2 2019 we had 800 million of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 3 million as of february 2 2019 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 2 2019 we had authorized for issuance 13 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 14 2016 

 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25 of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 2 2019 we maintained five forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of january 15 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 250 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year 2019 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 215 to 217 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 2 2019 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for 33 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 20 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

 

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 we have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2019 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lastin firstout “lifo” basis or market in total approximately 90 of inventories in 2018 and 93 of inventories in 2017 were valued using the lifo method the remaining inventories including substantially all fuel inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a fifo basis or net realizable value replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 1277 at february 2 2019 and 1248 at february 3 2018 the company follows the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating its lifo charge or credit 

  

the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at the company’s supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of the company’s inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts

goodwill 

  

the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of a triggering event the company performs reviews of each of its operating divisions and other consolidated entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2018 2017 and 2016 are summarized in note 3

store closing costs 

  

the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income the company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  

owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the company’s policy on impairment of longlived assets inventory writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in the consolidated statements of operations as “merchandise costs” costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 

  

the current portion of the future lease obligations of stores is included in “other current liabilities” and the longterm portion is included in “other longterm liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets 

 

interest rate risk management 

  

the company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates the company’s current program relative to interest rate protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its derivative instruments are described in note 7 

  

benefit plans and multiemployer pension plans

the determination of the obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

  

the company also participates in various multiemployer plans for substantially all union employees pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap refer to note 16 for additional information regarding the company’s participation in these various multiemployer pension plans

the current portion of the selfinsured liability is included in “other current liabilities” and the longterm portion is included in “other longterm liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company maintains surety bonds related to selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which the company is selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of the company’s obligations in the event the company is unable to meet its claim payment obligations up to its selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of the company as the company has recorded reserves for the claim costs 

  

the company is similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses the company maintains stop loss coverage to limit its property loss exposures including coverage for earthquake wind flood and other catastrophic events 

 

revenue recognition 

  

sales

gift cards and gift certificates 

  

the company does not recognize a sale when it sells its own gift cards and gift certificates collectively “gift cards” rather it records a deferred revenue liability equal to the amount received a sale is then recognized when the gift cards are redeemed to purchase the company’s products the company’s gift cards do not expire while gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months some are never fully redeemed the company recognizes gift card breakage under the proportional method where recognition of breakage income is based upon the historical runoff rate of unredeemed gift cards the company’s gift card deferred revenue liability was 100 as of february 2 2019 and 90 as of february 3 2018 

  

disaggregated revenues 

  

the following table presents sales revenue by type of product for the yearended february 2 2019 february 3 2018 and january 28 2017

warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages transportation direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred 

  

the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the company’s approach is to include in the “merchandise costs” line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold 

  

the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold 

  

advertising costs 

  

the company’s advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the “merchandise costs” line item of the consolidated statements of operations the company’s advertising costs totaled 752 in 2018 707 in 2017 and 717 in 2016 the company does not record vendor allowances for cooperative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense

a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate and the effective rate follows 

  



  

the 2018 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and an irs audit that resulted in a reduction of prior year tax deductions at pretax act rates and an increase in future tax deductions at posttax act rates these 2018 items were partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions and adjustments to provisional amounts that increased prior year deductions at pretax act rates and decreased future deductions at posttax act rates in accordance with sab 118 the company has completed accounting for the tax act resulting in no measurement period adjustments 

  

the 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the tax act the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by nondeducible goodwill impairment charges and the effect of state income taxes the 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments after the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

 

the tax effects of significant temporary differences that comprise tax balances were as follows 

  



  

at february 2 2019 the company had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of 1208 these net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2019 through 2038 the utilization of certain of the company’s state net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in a given year further based on the analysis described below the company has recorded a valuation allowance against some of the deferred tax assets resulting from its state net operating losses 

  

at february 2 2019 the company had state credit carryforwards of 47 most of which expire from 2019 through 2027 the utilization of certain of the company’s credits may be limited in a given year further based on the analysis described below the company has recorded a valuation allowance against some of the deferred tax assets resulting from its state credits 

  

at february 2 2019 the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 2 these net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2036 through 2037 the utilization of certain of the company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in a given year further based on the analysis described below the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting from its federal net operating losses 

  

the company regularly reviews all deferred tax assets on a tax filer and jurisdictional basis to estimate whether these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence this evidence includes historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company’s tax methods of accounting unless deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset until such time that realization becomes more likely than not increases and decreases in these valuation allowances are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations as of february 2 2019 february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 the total valuation allowance was 54 62 and 50 respectively 

 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits is as follows

7derivative financial instruments 

  

gaap requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met the company’s derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as “cash flow” hedges to the extent the hedges are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax effects ineffective portions of cash flow hedges if any are recognized in current period earnings other comprehensive income or loss is reclassified into current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as “fair value” hedges along with corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings ineffective portions of fair value hedges if any are recognized in current period earnings 

  

the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of a commercial paper program interest rate swaps fair value hedges and forwardstarting interest rate swaps cash flow hedges the company’s current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this the company uses the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25 of the carrying value of the company’s debt portfolio or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

the company reviews compliance with these guidelines annually with the financial policy committee of the board of directors these guidelines may change as the company’s needs dictate 

 

fair value interest rate swaps 

  

the table below summarizes the outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of february 3 2018 we have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2019 

  



  

the gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings as “interest expense” these gains and losses for 2018 and 2017 were as follows 

  



  

the following table summarizes the location and fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges on the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

  



  

 

cash flow forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

  

as of february 2 2019 the company had five forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of january 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 250 a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt the company entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on its forecasted issuance of debt in january 2020 accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 2 2019 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for 33 and accumulated other comprehensive income for 20 net of tax 

  

as of february 3 2018 the company had nine forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of january 2019 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 750 and five forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of january 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 250 the company entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on its forecasted issuance of debt in january 2019 and january 2020 accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 3 2018 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for 103 and accumulated other comprehensive income for 73 net of tax 

  

during 2018 the company terminated nine forwardstarting interest rate swaps with maturity dates of january 2019 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 750 these forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2018 since these forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges the unamortized gain of 39 30 net of tax has been deferred in aoci and will be amortized to earnings as the interest payments are made 

  

during 2017 the company terminated eleven forwardstarting interest rate swaps with maturity dates of august 2017 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 600 these forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt issued during the third quarter of 2017 since these forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges the unamortized loss of 20 12 net of tax has been deferred in aoci and will be amortized to earnings as the interest payments are made 

  

the following table summarizes the effect of the company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for 2018 and 2017 

  



  

the amounts of gainloss in aoci on derivatives include unamortized proceeds and payments from forwardstarting interest rate swaps once classified as cash flow hedges that were terminated prior to end of 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

for the above fair value and cash flow interest rate swaps the company has entered into international swaps and derivatives association master netting agreements that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts under these master netting agreements net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions these master netting agreements generally also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event 

  

collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of the company under these master netting agreements as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements 

 

the effect of the net settlement provisions of these master netting agreements on the company’s derivative balances upon an event of default or termination event is as follows as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 

  



  



  

  

8fair value measurements 

  

gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value the three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined in the standards are as follows 

  

level 1  quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

  

level 2  pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1 which are either directly or indirectly observable 

  

level 3  unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 

  

for items carried at or adjusted to fair value in the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize the fair value of these instruments at february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 

  

february 2 2019 fair value measurements using 

  



  

 

february 3 2018 fair value measurements using 

  



  

in 2018 realized gains on level 1 availableforsale securities totaled 5 

  

the company values interest rate hedges using observable forward yield curves these forward yield curves are classified as level 2 inputs 

  

fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analysis of goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and in the valuation of store lease exit costs the company reviews goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and as circumstances indicate the possibility of impairment see note 3 for further discussion related to the company’s carrying value of goodwill longlived assets and store lease exit costs were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy see note 1 for further discussion of the company’s policies and recorded amounts for impairments of longlived assets and valuation of store lease exit costs in 2018 longlived assets with a carrying amount of 85 were written down to their fair value of 29 resulting in an impairment charge of 56 in 2017 longlived assets with a carrying amount of 98 were written down to their fair value of 27 resulting in an impairment charge of 71 in 2018 the company entered into an agreement with a third party as part of the consideration for entering the agreement the company received a financial instrument of 22 

  

mergers are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the purchase price paid for a merger be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the merger with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets being recorded as goodwill see note 2 for further discussion related to accounting for mergers 

  

fair value of other financial instruments 

  

current and longterm debt 

  

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt including current maturities was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues adjusted for illiquidity based on available market evidence if quoted market prices were not available the fair value was based upon the net present value of the future cash flow using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at respective yearends at february 2 2019 the fair value of total debt was 14190 compared to a carrying value of 14351 at february 3 2018 the fair value of total debt was 15167 compared to a carrying value of 14787 

  

contingent consideration 

  

as a result of the home chef merger the company recognized a contingent liability of 91 on the acquisition date the contingent consideration was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs and is included in “other longterm liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheet  the liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period and the change in fair value including accretion for the passage of time is recognized in net earnings until the contingency is resolved in 2018 an adjustment to increase the contingent consideration liability as of yearend 2018 was recorded for 33 in oga expense 

  

cash and temporary cash investments store deposits intransit receivables prepaid and other current assets trade accounts payable accrued salaries and wages and other current liabilities 

  

the carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value 

 

other assets 

  

in 2016 the company entered into agreements with a third party as part of the consideration for entering these agreements the company received a financial instrument that derives its value from the third party’s business operations the company used the montecarlo simulation method to determine the fair value of this financial instrument the montecarlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical technique used to generate a defined number of valuation paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the fair value of this financial instrument the assumptions used in the montecarlo simulation are classified as level 3 inputs the financial instrument was valued at 335 and recorded in “other assets” within the consolidated balance sheets as the financial instrument was obtained in exchange for certain obligations the company also recognized offsetting deferred revenue liabilities in “other current liabilities” and “other longterm liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheets the deferred revenue will be amortized to “sales” within the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the agreements post inception the company received a distribution of 58 which was recorded as a reduction of the cost method investment in the fourth quarter of 2018 a transaction occurred that resulted in the settlement of the financial instrument as a result of the settlement the company received cash proceeds of 235 the company recognized an impairment of financial instrument of 42 in oga in the fourth quarter of 2018 

  

the fair values of certain investments recorded in “other assets” within the consolidated balance sheets were estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments or estimated cash flows if appropriate at february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 the carrying and fair value of longterm investments for which fair value is determinable was 155 and 176 respectively at february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 the carrying value of notes receivable for which fair value is determinable was 146 and 170 respectively

the following table represents the items reclassified out of aoci and the related tax effects for the years ended february 2 2019 february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 

  









  

  

10leases and leasefinanced transactions 

  

while the company’s current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate the company operates primarily in leased facilities lease terms generally range from 10 to 20 years with options to renew for varying terms terms of certain leases include escalation clauses percentage rent based on sales or payment of executory costs such as property taxes utilities or insurance and maintenance rent expense for leases with escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straightline basis beginning with the earlier of the lease commencement date or the date the company takes possession portions of certain properties are subleased to others for periods generally ranging from one to 20 years 

  

rent expense under operating leases consists of 

  



  

 

minimum annual rentals and payments under capital leases and leasefinanced transactions for the five years subsequent to 2019 and in the aggregate are listed below amounts in the table only include payments through the noncancelable lease term 

  



  

total future minimum rentals under noncancellable subleases at february 2 2019 were 183 

  

11earnings per common share 

  

net earnings attributable to the kroger co per basic common share equals net earnings attributable to the kroger co less income allocated to participating securities divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share equals net earnings attributable to the kroger co less income allocated to participating securities divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to dilutive stock options the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co and shares used in calculating net earnings attributable to the kroger co per basic common share to those used in calculating net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share 

  



  

the company had combined undistributed and distributed earnings to participating securities totaling 34 17 and 16 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

the company had stock options outstanding for approximately 101 million 156 million and 71 million shares respectively for the years ended february 2 2019 february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 which were excluded from the computations of net earnings per diluted common share because their inclusion would have had an antidilutive effect on net earnings per diluted share 

 

12stock option plans 

  

the company grants options for common shares “stock options” to employees under various plans at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock option at the date of grant the company accounts for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions under this method the company recognizes compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted the company recognizes sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award 

  

stock options typically expire 10 years from the date of grant stock options vest between one and five years from the date of grant at february 2 2019 approximately 22 million common shares were available for future option grants under the 2011 and 2014 longterm incentive plans the “plans” 

  

in addition to the stock options described above the company awards restricted stock to employees and nonemployee directors under various plans the restrictions on these awards generally lapse between one and five years from the date of the awards the company records expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date of the award over the period the awards lapse as of february 2 2019 approximately 6 million common shares were available under the plans for future restricted stock awards or shares issued to the extent performance criteria are achieved the company has the ability to convert shares available for stock options under the plans to shares available for restricted stock awards under the plans four shares available for option awards can be converted into one share available for restricted stock awards 

  

equity awards granted are based on the aggregate value of the award on grant date this can affect the number of shares granted in a given year as equity awards excess tax benefits related to equity awards are recognized in the provision for income taxes equity awards may be approved at one of four meetings of its board of directors occurring shortly after the company’s release of quarterly earnings the 2018 primary grant was made in conjunction with the june meeting of the company’s board of directors 

  

all awards become immediately exercisable upon certain changes of control of the company

changes in options outstanding under the stock option plans are summarized below 

  



  

 

a summary of options outstanding exercisable and expected to vest at february 2 2019 follows 

  



  

restricted stock 

  

changes in restricted stock outstanding under the restricted stock plans are summarized below 

  



  

the weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2018 2017 and 2016 was 678 471 and 748 respectively the fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model based on the assumptions shown in the table below the blackscholes model utilizes accounting judgment and financial estimates including the term option holders are expected to retain their stock options before exercising them the volatility of the company’s share price over that expected term the dividend yield over the term and the number of awards expected to be forfeited before they vest using alternative assumptions in the calculation of fair value would produce fair values for stock option grants that could be different than those used to record stockbased compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations the increase in the fair value of the stock options granted during 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from an increase in the company’s share price which decreased the expected dividend yield an increase in the weighted average expected volatility and the weighted average riskfree interest rate also contributed to the increase in fair value the decrease in the fair value of the stock options granted during 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a decrease in the company’s share price which increased the expected dividend yield partially offset by an increase in the weighted average expected volatility and the weighted average riskfree interest rate 

  

the following table reflects the weightedaverage assumptions used for grants awarded to option holders 

  



  

 

the weightedaverage riskfree interest rate was based on the yield of a treasury note as of the grant date continuously compounded which matures at a date that approximates the expected term of the options the dividend yield was based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts expected volatility was determined based upon historical stock volatilities however implied volatility was also considered expected term was determined based upon historical exercise and cancellation experience 

  

total stock compensation recognized in 2018 2017 and 2016 was 154 151 and 141 respectively stock option compensation recognized in 2018 2017 and 2016 was 25 32 and 28 respectively restricted shares compensation recognized in 2018 2017 and 2016 was 129 119 and 113 respectively 

  

the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was 58 55 and 105 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the total amount of cash received in 2018 by the company from the exercise of stock options granted under sharebased payment arrangements was 65 as of february 2 2019 there was 214 of total unrecognized compensation expense remaining related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under plans this cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately two years the total fair value of options that vested was 30 29 and 28 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

shares issued as a result of stock option exercises may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares proceeds received from the exercise of options and the related tax benefit may be utilized to repurchase the company’s common shares under a stock repurchase program adopted by the company’s board of directors during 2018 the company repurchased approximately three million common shares in such a manner 

  

13 commitments and contingencies 

  

the company continuously evaluates contingencies based upon the best available evidence 

  

the company believes that allowances for loss have been provided to the extent necessary and that its assessment of contingencies is reasonable to the extent that resolution of contingencies results in amounts that vary from the company’s estimates future earnings will be charged or credited 

  

the principal contingencies are described below 

  

insurance — the company’s workers’ compensation risks are selfinsured in most states in addition other workers’ compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans deductible plans and selfinsured retention plans the liability for workers’ compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are all reinsured with unrelated insurance companies operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances based upon actuarially determined estimates 

  

litigation — various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and when an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for the company’s exposure is not material to the company it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

assignments — the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees is unable to fulfill its lease obligations due to the wide distribution of the company’s assignments among third parties and various other remedies available the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote

the company’s discount rate assumptions were intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled they take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the company’s policy is to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 423 and 419 discount rates as of yearend 2018 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 2 2019 by approximately 362 

  

the company’s 2018 assumed pension plan investment return rate was 590 compared to 750 in 2017 and 740 in 2016 the value of all investments in the companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ended december 31 2018 net of investment management fees and expenses decreased 24 and for fiscal year 2018 investments increased 19 historically the company’s pension plans’ average rate of return was 81 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2018 net of all investment management fees and expenses for the past 20 years the company’s pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been 610 at the beginning of 2018 to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by the company for 2018 the company considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories 

  

the company calculates its expected return on plan assets by using the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is determined by adjusting the actual fair value of plan assets for gains or losses on plan assets gains or losses represent the difference between actual and expected returns on plan investments for each plan year gains or losses on plan assets are recognized evenly over a fiveyear period using a different method to calculate the marketrelated value of plan assets would provide a different expected return on plan assets 

  

on february 2 2019 the company adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement based on additional years of published mortality experience 

  

the funded status increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the 185 contribution made in 2018 to the qualified plans the increase in discount rate from 2017 to 2018 and the announced plan freeze to certain nonunion companysponsored pension plans as of december 31 2019

investment objectives policies and strategies are set by the pension investment committee the “committee” the primary objectives include holding and investing the assets and distributing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the pension plans investment objectives have been established based on a comprehensive review of the capital markets and each underlying plan’s current and projected financial requirements the time horizon of the investment objectives is longterm in nature and plan assets are managed on a goingconcern basis 

  

investment objectives and guidelines specifically applicable to each manager of assets are established and reviewed annually derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes including rebalancing exposures to certain asset classes any use of derivative instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited unless approved in advance by the committee 

  

the target allocations shown for 2018 were established in 2018 in conjunction with the continuation of the company’s transition to a ldi strategy which began in 2017 a ldi strategy focuses on maintaining a close to fullyfunded status over the longterm with minimal funded status risk this is achieved by investing more of the plan assets in fixed income instruments to more closely match the duration of the plan liability this ldi strategy will be phased in over time as the company is able to transition out of illiquid investments during this transition the company’s target allocation will change by increasing the company’s fixed income instruments cash flow from employer contributions and redemption of plan assets to fund participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes as appropriate the company expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs 

  

in 2018 the company contributed 185 117 net of tax to the companysponsored defined benefit plans and the company is not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2019 if the company does make any contributions in 2019 the company expects these contributions will decrease its required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions the company expects 2019 expense for companysponsored pension plans to be approximately 41 

  

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans the company used a 580 initial health care cost trend rate which is assumed to decrease on a linear basis to a 450 ultimate health care cost trend rate in 2037 to determine its expense a onepercentagepoint change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects

for measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 during 2018 and 2017 a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances is as follows

the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement 

  

the company contributed and expensed 263 219 and 215 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions compensation as defined by the plan and length of service 

 

16 multiemployer pension plans 

  

the company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

the company recognizes expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap the company made cash contributions to these plans of 358 in 2018 954 in 2017 and 289 in 2016 the increase in 2017 compared to 2018 and 2016 is primarily due to the 467 pretax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations of certain local unions of the central states pension fund and the 2017 united food and commercial workers “ufcw” contribution 

  

the company continues to evaluate and address potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to the company’s associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not a liability of the company when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to the company and its associates the company may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change the company’s debt profile as it relates to its credit rating since these off balance sheet commitments are typically considered in the company’s investment grade debt rating 

  

the company is currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and has sole investment authority over these assets the company became the fiduciary of the ibt consolidated pension fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the ibt that provided certain local unions of the company to withdraw from the central states pension fund significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are

 item 1 business 

  

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 3 2018 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2017 2016 and 2015 are to the fiscal years ended february 3 2018 january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

employees 

  

as of february 3 2018 kroger employed approximately 449000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 360 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

stores 

  

as of february 3 2018 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2782 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names of which 2268 had pharmacies and 1489 had fuel centers we offer clicklist™ and harris teeter expresslane— personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 1056 of our supermarkets and continue to increase our home delivery service available to customers approximately 45 of our supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 25 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

 

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of february 3 2018 we operated through subsidiaries 782 convenience stores 274 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer all 71 of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 66 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 55 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell fuel 

  

segments 

  

we operate supermarkets multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent over 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

our brands products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock over 15000 private label items our brands products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection® is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger® ralphs® fred meyer® king soopers® etc which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before we will carry a “banner brand” product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it pt…® check this out… and heritage farm™ are the three value brands designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition we continue to grow our brands offerings including simple truth® and simple truth organic® both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 33 of our brands units and 44 of the grocery category our brands units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants the remaining our brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers we perform a “make or buy” analysis on our brands products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of february 3 2018 we operated 37 food production plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies ten deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants one meat plant and two cheese plants 

 

seasonality 

  

the majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year additionally significant inclement weather systems particularly winter storms tend to affect our sales trends 

  

executive officers of the registrant 

  

the disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth in item 10 of part iii of this form 10k under the heading “executive officers of the company” and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

competitive environment 

  

for the disclosure related to our competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k which include forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation in addition evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online delivery ship to home and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment 

  

we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers however we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger  which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers our market share and business growth and our operations and results the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 360 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy 

  

our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control cyberattackers may attempt to access information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information although we have implemented procedures to protect our information and require our vendors to do the same we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against rapidly evolving increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against further a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information in addition hardware software or applications we may use may have inherent defects or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security 

  

our continued investment in our information technology systems may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks breaches or disruptions to our business operations which could result in a loss of customers or business information negative publicity damage to our reputation and exposure to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance in addition compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues 

  

additionally on october 1 2015 the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv transactions we completed the implementation of the emv technology for our supermarket transactions and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers which will occur in 2020 

  

indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings and insurance 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of two of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

integration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

  

fuel 

  

we sell a significant amount of fuel which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

economic conditions 

  

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 2 properties 

  

as of february 3 2018 we operated approximately 3900 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and food production plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct our business are leased 

  

we generally own store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and food production equipment the total cost of our owned assets and capitalized leases at february 3 2018 was 417 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 207 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution food production and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and the “outlook” section below 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 3 2018 kroger is one of the world’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2782 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the district of columbia of these stores 2268 have pharmacies and 1489 have fuel centers we offer clicklist™ and harris teeter expresslane — personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 1056 of our supermarkets and continue to increase our home delivery service available to customers in addition we operate 782 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees 274 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer 

  

we operate 37 food production plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 33 of our brands units and 44 of the grocery category our brands units sold in our supermarkets the remaining our brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 97 of our consolidated sales is our only reportable segment 

  

on september 2 2016 we closed our merger with modern hc holdings inc “modernhealth” by purchasing 100 of the outstanding shares of modernhealth for 407 million modernhealth is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet for 2016 and 2017 and in our consolidated statements of operations from september 2 2016 through january 28 2017 and all periods in 2017 

  

on december 18 2015 we closed our merger with roundy’s inc “roundy’s” by purchasing 100 of roundy’s® outstanding common stock for 360 per share and assuming roundy’s outstanding debt for a purchase price of 866 million roundy’s is included in our ending consolidated balance sheets for 2015 2016 and 2017 and in our consolidated statements of operations for the last six weeks of 2015 and all periods in 2016 and 2017 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our mergers with modernhealth and roundy’s 

  

use of nongaap financial measures   

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share and free cash flow because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings net earnings per diluted share and net cash provided or used by operating or investing activities or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap our calculation and reasons these are useful metrics to investors and analysts are explained below 

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” credit or charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

 

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo credit or charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness 

  

the adjusted net earnings per diluted share metric is an important measure used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods w e believe adjusted net earnings per diluted share is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it presents more accurate yearoveryear comparisons for our net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations net earnings for 2017 include the following which we define as the “2017 adjusted items” 

  



  



  



  

in addition net earnings include 119 million 79 million net of tax due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2017 the “extra week” 

  

net earnings for 2016 include 111 million 71 million net of tax of charges to oga related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits the “2016 adjusted items” there were no adjusted items in 2015 

  

we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus net cash used by investing activities free cash flow is an important measure used by management to evaluate available funding for share repurchases dividends other strategic investments and managing debt levels management believes free cash flow is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it demonstrates our ability to make share repurchases and other strategic investments pay dividends and manage debt levels 

 

overview   

  

notable items for 2017 are 

  



























  

the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co to adjusted net earnings attributable to the kroger co and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share to adjusted net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share excluding the 2017 and 2016 adjusted items in 2015 we did not have any adjustment items that affected net earnings or net earnings per diluted share

the increase in total sales in 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the increase in adjusted sales and the extra week total adjusted sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 by 44 this increase was primarily due to our increases in total supermarket sales without fuel fuel sales and our merger with modern hc holdings inc “ modernhealth” the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2017 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2016 was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 07 and an increase in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us changes in product mix and product cost inflation of 07 partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers excluding mergers acquisitions and operational closings total supermarket square footage at the end of 2017 increased 19 over the end of 2016 total adjusted fuel sales increased 139 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 123 and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 14 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

  

total sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015 by 50 this increase was primarily due to our increase in total supermarket sales without fuel and our merger with modernhealth partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to a 94 decrease in the average retail fuel price the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our merger with roundy’s an increase in supermarket square footage and our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 10 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us partially offset by product cost deflation of 08 excluding mergers acquisitions and operational closings total supermarket square footage at the end of 2016 increased 34 over 2015 total fuel sales decreased 56 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 94 partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 42 the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical multidepartment stores our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the following table we used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2017 and 2016 

 

identical supermarket sales 

 in millions 

  





  

gross margin lifo and fifo gross margin 

  

we define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in gross margin 

  

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2201 in 2017 2240 in 2016 and 2216 in 2015 the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and our merger with modernhealth due to its lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing transportation and shrink costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by improved merchandise costs a lower lifo charge a change in our product sales mix including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales growth in our brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products decreased advertising costs as a percentage of sales and a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales 

  

the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from lower fuel sales a lower lifo charge and our merger with roundy’s due to its historically higher gross margin rate partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment our merger with modernhealth due to its historically lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing and shrink costs as a percentage of sales 

  

our lifo credit for 2017 was 8 million compared to a lifo charge of 19 million in 2016 and 28 million in 2015 our lifo credit in 2017 was primarily due to a reduction of pharmacy inventory in 2017 compared to 2016 in 2016 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation in other departments in 2015 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy 

  

our fifo gross margin rates which exclude the lifo credit and charge were 2201 in 2017 2242 in 2016 and 2218 in 2015 excluding the effect of fuel the extra week and modernhealth our fifo gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 this decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers increased warehousing transportation and shrink costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by improved merchandise costs a change in our product sales mix including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales growth in our brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products and decreased advertising costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of fuel and our mergers with roundy’s and modernhealth our fifo gross margin rate decreased seven basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 this decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increased warehousing and shrink costs as a percentage of sales 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages healthcare benefit costs and retirement plan costs and utility and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

 

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1758 in 2017 1663 in 2016 and 1634 in 2015 the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from the 2017 oga adjusted items investing in our digital strategy increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention employee engagement and customer experience the 2017 ufcw contribution increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs partially offset by savings from the vro effective cost controls higher fuel sales the 2016 adjusted items and our merger with modernhealth due to its lower oga rate as a percentage of sales our fuel sales lower our oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of fuel the extra week the 2017 ufcw contribution the 2017 oga and 2016 adjusted items and modernhealth our oga rate increased 22 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase resulted primarily from investing in our digital strategy increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention employee engagement and customer experience increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs partially offset by savings from the vro and effective cost controls 

  

the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment the 2016 adjusted items our mergers with roundy’s and modernhealth due to their historically higher oga rate compared to our other divisions and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs partially offset by increased supermarket sales productivity improvements effective cost controls 110 million ufcw contributions made during 2015 “2015 ufcw contributions” and decreases in incentive plans companysponsored pension plans and utility costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of fuel the 2016 adjusted items recent mergers and the 2015 ufcw contributions our oga rate decreased five basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 this decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales productivity improvements effective cost controls and decreases in incentive plans companysponsored pension plans and utility costs partially offset by the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs as a percentage of sales 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 due to our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and higher fuel sales which decreases our rent expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by increased closed store liabilities 

  

rent expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2016 compared to 2015 due to o ur merger with roundy’s due to its higher volume of leased versus owned supermarkets and l ower f uel sales which increases our rent expense rate as a percentage of sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher fuel sales which decreases our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales the extra week and the 2017 depreciation adjusted item partially offset by additional depreciation on capital investments excluding mergers and lease buyouts of 30 billion during 2017 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of sales 2016 compared to 2015 due to a dditional depreciation on capital investments excluding mergers and lease buyouts of 36 billion during 2016 unfavorable sales leveraging from transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and our merger with roundy’s 

  

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 21 billion in 2017 34 billion in 2016 and 36 billion in 2015 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 170 in 2017 298 in 2016 and 326 in 2015 operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 128 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a lower gross margin and increased oga partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses and a lower lifo charge as a percentage of sales 

 

operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 28 basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increased oga depreciation and amortization and rent expenses partially offset by higher gross margin and a lower lifo charge as a percentage of sales 

  

fifo operating profit was 21 billion in 2017 35 billion in 2016 and 36 billion in 2015 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 169 in 2017 300 in 2016 and 328 in 2015 fuel sales lower our operating profit rate due to the very low operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the extra week the 2017 ufcw contribution the 2017 and 2016 adjusted items and modernhealth decreased 46 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a lower gross margin and increased oga and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2016 adjusted items the effects of our recent mergers and the 2015 ufcw contributions decreased 14 basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 this decrease was due to lower gross margin higher depreciation and amortization partially offset by decreased oga and rent expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

specific factors of the above operating trends under operating profit and fifo operating profit are discussed earlier in this section 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 601 million in 2017 522 million in 2016 and 482 million in 2015 the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases the extra week the 12 billion we contributed to companysponsored and companymanaged pension plans in 2017 a 467 million pretax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the central states pension fund partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate the increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases mergers and a higher weighted average interest rate 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 273 in 2017 328 in 2016 and 338 in 2015 the 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the tax act  the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by nondeductible goodwill impairment charges and the effect of state income taxes the 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments after the adoption of asu 201609 the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2015 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

  

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

  

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section 

  

net earnings of 209 per diluted share in 2017 represented an increase of 20 from net earnings of 205 per diluted share in 2016 excluding the 2017 and 2016 adjusted items and the extra week adjusted net earnings of 195 per diluted share in 2017 represented a decrease of 80 from adjusted net earnings of 212 per diluted share in 2016 the 80 decrease in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from lower nonfuel fifo operating profit and increased interest expense partially offset by higher fuel earnings a lower lifo charge decreased income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases 

  

net earnings of 205 per diluted share in 2016 represented a decrease of 05 from net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 excluding the 2016 adjusted items net earnings of 212 per diluted share in 2016 represented an increase of 29 from net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 the net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items the 29 increase resulted primarily from a lower lifo charge lower income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by lower nonfuel fifo operating profit and lower fuel earnings 

 

common share repurchase programs 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 16 billion in 2017 17 billion in 2016 and 500 million in 2015 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 66 million in 2017 105 million in 2016 and 203 million in 2015 of our common shares under the stock option program 

  

the shares repurchased in 2017 were reacquired under the following repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors to reacquire shares via open market purchases 

  



  



  



  

on march 15 2018 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program to supplement the june 2017 repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions including accelerated stock repurchase transactions block trades or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “march 2018 repurchase program” 

  

during the first quarter through march 29 2018 we used an additional 388 million of cash to repurchase 16 million common shares at an average price of 2505 per share as of march 29 2018 we have exhausted the june 2017 repurchase program and have 885 million remaining under the march 2018 repurchase program 

  

capital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 30 billion in 2017 37 billion in 2016 and 33 billion in 2015 capital investments for mergers totaled 16 million in 2017 401 million in 2016 and 168 million in 2015 we merged with modernhealth in 2016 and roundy’s in 2015 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these mergers capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 13 million in 2017 5 million in 2016 and 35 million in 2015 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes and v the average liabilities held for sale averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2017 and 2016 on a 52 week basis  in millions 

  







  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february 3 2018 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 3 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 71 million in 2017 26 million in 2016 and 46 million in 2015 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 29 billion as of february 3 2018 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

 

our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter in 2017 we recorded goodwill impairment for our kroger specialty pharmacy reporting unit totaling 110 million 74 million net of tax the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2016 and 2015 did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2017 2016 and 2015 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 15 to the consolidated financial statements also discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 400 and 393 discount rates as of yearend 2017 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 425 and 418 as of yearend 2016 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 3 2018 by approximately 426 million 

 

our 2017 assumed pension plan investment return rate was 750 compared to 740 in 2016 and 744 in 2015 the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2017 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 87 historically the kroger pension plans’ average rate of return was 57 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2017 net of all investment management fees and expenses for the past 20 years the kroger pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been 710 at the beginning of 2017 to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for 2017 we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories based on this information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations which contemplates our transition to a liability driven investment strategy we believed a 750 rate of return assumption was reasonable for 2017 in 2016 kroger began managing the assets for the harris teeter and roundy’s pension plans and our expected rate of return for 2016 reflects implementing a similar investment management strategy for the harris teeter and roundy’s plans’ assets see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

on january 31 2015 we adopted new industry specific mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in determining our benefit obligations on january 28 2017 we adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement based on additional years of published mortality experience 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions 



  

in 2017 we contributed 10 billion to our companysponsored defined benefit plans and we are not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2018 we contributed 3 million to our companysponsored defined benefit plans in 2016 and 5 million in 2015 among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions 

  

in 2017 we settled certain companysponsored pension plan obligations using existing assets of the plan and the 10 billion contribution we recognized a settlement charge of approximately 502 million 335 million net of tax associated with the settlement of our obligations for the eligible participants’ pension balances that were distributed out of the plan via a transfer to other qualified retirement plan options a lump sum payout or the purchase of an annuity contract based on each participant’s election 

  

we contributed and expensed 219 million in 2017 215 million in 2016 and 196 million in 2015 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to our recent mergers the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 954 million in 2017 289 million in 2016 and 426 million in 2015 the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the 467 million pretax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the central states pension fund and the 2017 ufcw contribution 

 

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets as such we include contributions to these plans when we disclose contributions to companysponsored and companymanaged pension plans we became the fiduciary of the ibt consolidated pension fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the ibt that provided our withdrawal from the central states pension fund significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are 

  



  



  



  



  

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2017 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of december 31 2017 we estimate our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or as it relates to certain funds an estimated withdrawal liability was approximately 23 billion 18 billion net of tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 700 million 446 million net of tax as of december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to withdrawing from and settlements for withdrawal liabilities for certain multiemployer pension plan obligations the 2017 ufcw contribution and returns on assets in the funds our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 93 and 89 of inventories were valued using the lifo method in 2017 and 2016 respectively the remaining inventories including substantially all fuel inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a fifo basis or net realizable value replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 12 billion at february 3 2018 and 13 billion at january 28 2017 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 85 billion in 2017 78 billion in 2016 and 73 billion in 2015 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 93 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns

during the second quarter of 2016 we adopted asu 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” this amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows as a result of the adoption we recognized 49 million of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments in our provision for income taxes in 2016 these items were historically recorded in additional paidin capital in addition for 2016 cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity cash paid on employees’ behalf related to shares withheld for tax purposes is classified as a financing activity retrospective application of the cash flow presentation requirements resulted in increases to both “net cash provided by operating activities” and “net cash used by financing activities” of 59 million for 2016 and 84 million for 2015 our stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures 

  

during 2016 we adopted asu 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern topic 205” this standard requires us to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether there are conditions and events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued if substantial doubt is raised additional disclosures around our plan to alleviate these doubts are required the adoption of this standard did not affect our consolidated financial statements

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” as amended by several subsequent asus which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standard’s overarching principle is that revenue must be recognized when goods and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that is proportionate to what has been delivered at that point and that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods or services per asu 201514 “deferral of effective date” this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending february 2 2019 we formed a project team to assess and document our accounting policies related to the new revenue guidance as of the end of 2017 we have completed this assessment and documentation based on this project we do not expect that the implementation of the new standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of cash flows we intend to adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis and will be addressing new disclosures regarding revenue recognition policies as required by the new standard at adoption during our assessment we identified and will be implementing changes at the beginning of the first quarter of 2018 to our accounting policies and practices business processes systems and controls to support the new revenue recognition and disclosure requirements 

 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements the standard’s core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding rightofuse assets this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending february 1 2020 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this asu will result in a significant increase to our consolidated balance sheets for lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial statements this evaluation process includes reviewing all forms of leases performing a completeness assessment over the lease population analyzing the practical expedients and assessing opportunities to make certain changes to our lease accounting information technology system in order to determine the best implementation strategy we believe our current offbalance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating 

  

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu 201707 compensation  retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost” asu 201707 requires an employer to report the service cost component of retiree benefits in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations asu 201707 is effective for years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and requires retrospective application to all periods presented this asu will impact our operating profit subtotal as reported in our consolidated statement of operations by excluding interest expense investment returns settlements and other nonservice cost components of retiree benefit expenses information about interest expense investment returns and other components of retiree benefit expenses can be found in note 15 of our consolidated financial statements  

  

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” asu 201802 amends asc 220 “income statement  reporting comprehensive income” to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act in addition under the asu 201802 we may be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects asu 201802 is effective for years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 34 billion of cash from operations in 2017 compared to 43 billion in 2016 and 49 billion in 2015 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization lifo credit charge stock compensation expense for companysponsored pension plans goodwill impairment charge and deferred income taxes changes in working capital created a net cash outflow in 2017 and 2016 and a net cash inflow for 2015 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests the 10 billion contribution to the companysponsored defined benefit plans and deferred taxes partially offset by an increase in noncash expenses and changes in working capital deferred taxes changed in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the tax act 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and changes in working capital partially offset by an increase in noncash expenses deferred taxes and lower payments on longterm liabilities 

 

cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 164 in 2017 compared to 492 million in 2016 and 180 million in 2015 the decrease in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the net effect of the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 27 billion in 2017 compared to 39 billion in 2016 and 36 billion in 2015 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reduced cash payments for capital investments and lower payments for mergers the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased cash payments for capital investments and our merger with modernhealth 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

cash used by financing activities was 681 million in 2017 352 million in 2016 and 13 billion in 2015 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net longterm borrowings partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases and higher net commercial paper borrowings the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases partially offset by higher longterm and commercial paper borrowings 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 15 billion to 156 billion as of yearend 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted from the issuance of i 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 280 ii 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 370 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 465 and iv increases in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by payments of 700 million on maturing longterm debt obligations 

 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 20 billion to 141 billion as of yearend 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted from the issuance of i 10 billion of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 445 ii 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 265 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3875 iv 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 15 v increases in commercial paper borrowings and vi increases in capital lease obligations due to additional leased locations partially offset by payments of 14 billion on maturing longterm debt obligations 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to approximate 69 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2017 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 21 billion of commercial paper and 13 billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the 69 billion of estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in 2018 by issuing additional senior notes a term loan or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the company’s share repurchase programs and have a growing dividend subject to board approval we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at february 3 2018 we had 21 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating as of march 29 2018 we had 11 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants are described below 

  



  



  

our credit facility is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2017 

 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 3 2018 in millions of dollars 

  

















  

as   of february 3 2018 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on august 29 2022 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility the commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of february 3 2018 we had 21 billion of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 6 million as of february 3 2018 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 3 2018 we had authorized for issuance 25 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 14 2016 

 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 3 2018 we maintained two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount totaling 100 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature in december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

as of february 3 2018 we maintained 14 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of january 15 2019 and january 15 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 10 billion a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 215 to 248 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 3 2018 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for 103 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 73 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

 

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives 

classified as fair value hedges as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  



  



  



  



  

based on our yearend 2017 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies

 item 1 business 

  

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 28 2017 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2016 2015 and 2014 are to the fiscal years ended january 28 2017 january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

employees 

  

as of january 28 2017 kroger employed approximately 443000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 366 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

stores 

  

as of january 28 2017 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2796 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names of which 2255 had pharmacies and 1445 had fuel centers we also offer clicklist™ and harris teeter expresslane— personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 637 of our supermarkets approximately 48 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 25 mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 28 2017 we operated through subsidiaries 784 convenience stores 319 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer all 114 of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 69 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 56 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell fuel 

  

segments 

  

we operate supermarkets multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent over 98 of our consolidated sales and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is our only reportable segment we aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division this geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions the geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock over 14000 private label items our corporate brand products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection® is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger® ralphs® fred meyer® king soopers® etc which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before we will carry a “banner brand” product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it pt…® check this out… and heritage farm™ are the three value brands designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition we continue to grow our other brands including simple truth® and simple truth organic® both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 35 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers this percentage has declined recently due to an expanded portfolio of nongrocery corporate brand units produced by outside manufacturers our food production plants produced 45 of our grocery category corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets which is consistent with our historical trend we perform a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 28 2017 we operated 38 food production plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies ten deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants 

  

 

seasonality 

  

the majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year additionally significant inclement weather systems particularly winter storms tend to affect our sales trends

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 366 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

 

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

additionally on october 1 2015 the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv transactions we completed the implementation of the emv technology for more than the majority of our supermarket transactions in 2016 with plans to complete them in 2017 and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers 

  

indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings and insurance 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

 

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

integration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

  

fuel 

  

we sell a significant amount of fuel which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

economic conditions 

  

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

 

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 2 properties 

  

as of january 28 2017 we operated approximately 4000 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and food production plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct our business are leased 

  

we generally own store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and food production equipment the total cost of our owned assets and capitalized leases at january 28 2017 was 406 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 196 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution food production and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and the “outlook” section below 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 kroger is one of the world’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2796 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the district of columbia of these stores 2255 have pharmacies and 1445 have fuel centers we also offer clicklist™ and harris teeter expresslane — personalized order online pick up at the store services — at 637 of our supermarkets and operate 784 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees 319 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer 

  

we operate 38 food production plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 35 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers this percentage has declined recently due to an expanded portfolio of nongrocery corporate brand units produced by outside manufacturers our food production plants produced 45 of our grocery category corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets which is consistent with our historical trend 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores fuel centers and via our online platforms we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 98 of our consolidated sales and ebitda is our only reportable segment 

  

on september 2 2016 we closed our merger with modern hc holdings inc “modernhealth” by purchasing 100 of the outstanding shares of modernhealth for 407 million modernhealth is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet for 2016 and in our consolidated statements of operations from september 2 2016 through january 28 2017 

  

on december 18 2015 we closed our merger with roundy’s inc “roundy’s” by purchasing 100 of roundy’s® outstanding common stock for 360 per share and assuming roundy’s outstanding debt for a purchase price of 866 million roundy’s is included in our ending consolidated balance sheets for 2015 and 2016 and in our consolidated statements of operations for the last six weeks of 2015 and all periods in 2016 

  

on august 18 2014 we closed our merger with vitacostcom® by purchasing 100 of the vitacostcom outstanding common stock for 800 per share or 287 million vitacostcom is included in our ending consolidated balance sheets for 2015 and 2016 and in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods succeeding the merger 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our mergers with modernhealth roundy’s and vitacostcom 

  

 

use of nongaap financial measures   

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the related notes set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap measures including firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin fifo operating profit adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin operating profit net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap our calculation and reasons these are useful metrics to investors and analysts are explained below 

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness 

  

we believe the adjusted net earnings per diluted share metric presents more accurate yearoveryear comparisons for our net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations

total sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015 by 50 this increase was primarily due to our increase in total supermarket sales without fuel and our merger with modernhealth partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to a 94 decrease in the average retail fuel price the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our merger with roundy’s an increase in supermarket square footage and our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 10 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us partially offset by product cost deflation of 08 excluding mergers acquisitions and operational closings total supermarket square footage at the end of 2016 increased 34 over 2015 total fuel sales decreased 56 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 94 partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 42 the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel 

  

total sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 by 13 this increase in 2015 total sales compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 50 total sales also increased due to the inclusion of roundy’s sales due to our merger for the period of december 18 2015 to january 30 2016 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us an increase in visits per household changes in product mix and product cost inflation total fuel sales decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 267 decrease in the average retail fuel price partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 71 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations as illustrated in the following table and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical multidepartment stores and roundy’s stores that are identical as if they were part of the company in the prior year our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the following table we used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2016 and 2015 

  

identical supermarket sales

gross margin lifo and fifo gross margin 

  

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2240 in 2016 2216 in 2015 and 2116 in 2014 the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from lower fuel sales a lower lifo charge and our merger with roundy’s due to its historically higher gross margin rate partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment our merger with modernhealth due to its historically lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing and shrink costs as a percentage of sales the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from lower fuel sales reductions in transportation costs and a lower lifo charge partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs as a percentage of sales lower fuel sales increase our gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low gross margin rate as a percentage of sales on fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales 

  

 

our lifo charge was 19 million in 2016 28 million in 2015 and 147 million in 2014 in 2016 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation in other departments in 2015 we experienced lower product cost inflation compared to 2014 which resulted in a lower lifo charge in 2015 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy in 2014 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy grocery deli meat and seafood 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2242 in 2016 2218 in 2015 and 2130 in 2014 excluding the effect of fuel and our mergers with roundy’s and modernhealth “recent mergers” our fifo gross margin rate decreased seven basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 this decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increased warehousing and shrink costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of fuel our fifo gross margin rate decreased four basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 this decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs partially offset by a reduction in transportation costs as a percentage of sales 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefits and retirement plan costs utility and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga

oga expenses as a percentage of sales increased 52 basis points to 1634 in 2015 from 1582 in 2014 this increase resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales increases in emv chargebacks companysponsored pension healthcare and incentive plan costs partially offset by increased supermarket sales the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation lower charges for total contributions to the kroger foundation and ufcw consolidated pension plan “2014 contributions” compared to the 2015 ufcw contributions productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level excluding fuel the 2015 ufcw contributions the 2014 contributions and the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation our oga rate decreased nine basis points compared to 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level partially offset by increases in emv chargebacks  companysponsored pension healthcare and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales

rent expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to our merger with roundy’s  partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible rent expense as a percentage of sales in 2015 was consistent with 2014 due to the effect of our merger with roundy’s being offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 34 billion in 2016 36 billion in 2015 and 31 billion in 2014 operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 28 basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increased oga depreciation and amortization and rent expenses partially offset by higher gross margin and a lower lifo charge as a percentage of sales operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 37 basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher gross margin and a lower lifo charge partially offset by increased oga depreciation and amortization and rent expenses as a percentage of sales specific factors of these operating trends are discussed earlier in this section

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 522 million in 2016 482 million in 2015 and 488 million in 2014 the increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases mergers and a higher weighted average interest rate the decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from the timing of debt principal payments and debt issuances partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our commercial paper program 

  

 

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 328 in 2016 338 in 2015 and 341 in 2014 the 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments after the adoption of asu 201609 the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2015 and 2014 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

  

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 

  

our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the results of operations section 

  

net earnings of 205 per diluted share in 2016 represented a decrease of 05 from net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 excluding the 2016 adjusted items net earnings of 212 per diluted share in 2016 represented an increase of 29 from net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 the net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items the 29 increase resulted primarily from a lower lifo charge lower income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by lower nonfuel fifo operating profit and lower fuel earnings 

  

net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 represented a increase of 198 from net earnings of 172 per diluted share in 2014 excluding the 2014 adjusted items net earnings of 206 per diluted share in 2015 represented an increase of 170 from net earnings of 176 per diluted share in 2014 the net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items the 170 increase resulted primarily from higher nonfuel fifo operating profit a lower lifo charge and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases partially offset by lower fuel earnings and higher income tax expense 

  

common share repurchase programs 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 17 billion in 2016 500 million in 2015 and 11 billion in 2014 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 105 million in 2016 203 million in 2015 and 155 million in 2014 of our common shares under the stock option program 

  

the following board of director authorizations created repurchase programs to reacquire shares via open market purchases 

  







  

during the first quarter through march 28 2017 the company used an additional 341 million of cash to repurchase 11 million common shares at an average price of 3109 per share as of march 28 2017 we have exhausted the september 2016 program and have 498 million remaining under the march 2017 program 

  

 

capital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 37 billion in 2016 33 billion in 2015 and 27 billion in 2014 capital investments for mergers totaled 401 million in 2016 168 million in 2015 and 252 million in 2014 we merged with modernhealth in 2016 roundy’s in 2015 and vitacostcom in 2014 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these mergers capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 5 million in 2016 35 million in 2015 and 135 million in 2014 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

  

 

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2016 and 2015 the january 30 2016 calculation of roic excludes the financial position and results for the roundys merger 

  







  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

 

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 28 2017 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 2 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 26 million in 2016 46 million in 2015 and 37 million in 2014 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

 

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 30 billion as of january 28 2017 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2016 2015 and 2014 did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

 

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 15 to the consolidated financial statements also discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 425 and 418 discount rates as of yearend 2016 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 462 and 444 as of yearend 2015 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 28 2017 by approximately 510 million 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for 2016 we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in 2016 our assumed pension plan investment return rate was 740 compared to 744 in 2015 and 2014 during 2016 kroger began managing the assets for the harris teeter and roundy’s pension plans and our expected rate of return reflects implementing a similar investment management strategy for the harris teeter and roundy’s plans’ assets historically the kroger pension plans’ average rate of return was 581 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2016 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2016 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 690 for the past 20 years the kroger pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been 777 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe a 740 rate of return assumption is reasonable for 2016 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

on january 31 2015 we adopted new industry specific mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in determining our benefit obligations on january 28 2017 we adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement based on additional years of published mortality experience 

  

 

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions 

  



  

in 2016 we contributed 3 million to our companysponsored defined benefit plans and are not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2017 we contributed 5 million to our companysponsored defined benefit plans in 2015 and did not make contributions in 2014 among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions 

  

we contributed and expensed 215 million in 2016 196 million in 2015 and 177 million in 2014 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to our recent mergers the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to a higher employee savings rate the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 289 million in 2016 426 million in 2015 and 297 million in 2014 

  

we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans these underfundings are not our liability when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates we may negotiate the restructuring of underfunded multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multiemployer pension plan the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are 

  



  



  



  

 

as we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds two locations have initiated a withdrawal process in the first quarter of 2017 resulting in an estimated withdrawal liability of less than 100 million aftertax 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2016 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of december 31 2016 we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or as it relates to certain funds an estimated withdrawal liability was approximately 30 billion pretax or 18 billion aftertax this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 100 million pretax or approximately 40 million aftertax as of december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans during 2016 and changes in mortality rate assumptions our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2017 we expect to contribute approximately 360 million to multiemployer pension plans which excludes any additional multiemployer pension plan restructurings that could occur of this amount 35 million has been accrued for as of january 28 2017 we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer pension plans benefit payments or future restructuring agreements the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 28 2017 the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of our 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

 

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we adopted a new sharebased compensation standard during 2016 which requires recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments in our provision for income taxes excess tax benefits were historically recorded in additional paidin capital 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 89 and 95 of inventories were valued using the lifo method in 2016 and 2015 respectively cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 13 billion at january 28 2017 and january 31 2016 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 78 billion in 2016 73 billion in 2015 and 69 billion in 2014 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 92 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in september 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201516 “business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” this amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination this amendment became effective for us beginning january 31 2016 and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations 

  

during the second quarter of 2016 we adopted asu 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” this amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows as a result of the adoption we recognized 49 million of excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments in our provision for income taxes in 2016 these items were historically recorded in additional paidin capital in addition for 2016 cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity cash paid on employees’ behalf related to shares withheld for tax 

 

purposes is classified as a financing activity retrospective application of the cash flow presentation requirements resulted in increases to both “net cash provided by operating activities” and “net cash used by financing activities” of 59 million for 2016 84 million for 2015 and 52 for 2014 our stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures 

  

during 2016 we adopted asu 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern topic 205” this standard requires us to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether there are conditions and events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued if substantial doubt is raised additional disclosures around our plan to alleviate these doubts are required the adoption of this standard did not affect our consolidated financial statements 

  

during 2016 we adopted asu 201507 “fair value measurement  disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent topic 820” this standard requires us to disclose which assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient and ends the requirement to classify these assets within the gaap fair value hierarchy see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements for disclosures of assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” as amended by several subsequent asus which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services per asu 201514 “deferral of effective date” this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february 2 2019 early adoption is permitted as of the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february 3 2018 we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” this amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position this guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending february 3 2018 early adoption is permitted the implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our consolidated statements of operations and will not have a significant effect on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements the standard’s core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding rightofuse assets this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending february 1 2020 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this asu will result in a significant increase to our consolidated balance sheets for lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial statements we believe our current offbalance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 43 billion of cash from operations in 2016 compared to 49 billion in 2015 and 42 billion in 2014 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense for companysponsored pension plans and the lifo charge changes in working capital created a net cash outflow in 2016 and net cash inflows for 2015 and 2014 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and changes in working capital partially offset by an increase in noncash expenses deferred taxes and lower payments on longterm liabilities 

 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests an increase in noncash items and changes in working capital the increase in noncash items in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and expense for companysponsored pension plans partially offset by a lower lifo charge 

  

cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 492 million in 2016 compared to 180 million in 2015 and 3 million in 2014 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the net effect of the following 











  

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by trade accounts payables and store deposits in transit partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by income taxes receivable and payable 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 39 billion in 2016 compared to 36 billion in 2015 and 31 billion in 2014 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased cash payments for capital investments and our merger with modernhealth the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased payments for capital investments partially offset by lower payments for mergers 

  

net cash provided used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used cash of 352 million in 2016 13 billion in 2015 and 12 billion in 2014 the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases partially offset by higher longterm and commercial paper borrowings the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to increased payments on longterm debt and commercial paper partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of longterm debt and decreased treasury stock purchases 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 20 billion to 141 billion as of yearend 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted from the issuance of i 10 billion of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 445 ii 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 265 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3875 iv 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 15 v increases in commercial paper borrowings and vi increases in capital lease obligations due to additional leased locations partially offset by payments of 14 billion on maturing longterm debt obligations 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 481 million to 121 billion as of yearend 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from the issuance of i 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 200 ii 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 260 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 350 and iv an increase in capital lease obligations due to our merger with roundy’s and various leased locations partially offset by payments of 678 million on longterm debt obligations assumed as part of our merger with roundy’s and 500 million of payments at maturity of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 390 the increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with roundy’s

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to range from 59 to 64 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2016 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 14 billion of commercial paper and 600 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the range of 59 to 64 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in 2017 by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the company’s share repurchase programs and a growing dividend we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper program at january 28 2017 we had 14 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march 22 2017 we had 956 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants are described below 

  



  



  

our credit facility is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2016 

  

 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 28 2017 in millions of dollars 

  

















  

as of january 28 2017 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on june 30 2019 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility as of january 28 2017 we had 14 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled 13 million as of january 28 2017 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 28 2017 we had authorized for issuance 4 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 14 2016 

  

 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including multiemployer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 28 2017 we maintained two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount totaling 100 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature in december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

as of january 28 2017 we maintained 25 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of august 15 2027 january 15 2029 january 15 2049 and january 15 2050 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 16 billion a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2017 2018 and 2019 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 207 to 300 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of january 28 2017 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for 67 million other longterm liabilities for 7 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 38 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

 

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives 

classified as fair value hedges as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  



  



  



  



  

based on our yearend 2016 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies

part iv 

  




 item 1   business 

  

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 30 2016 we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets our principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and our telephone number is 513 7624000 we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores and fuel centers we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2015 2014 and 2013 are to the fiscal years ended january 30 2016 january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

e mployees 

  

as of january 30 2016 kroger employed approximately 431000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 350 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

s tores 

  

as of january 30 2016 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2778 retail food stores under a variety of local banner names 1387 of which had fuel centers approximately 42 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers’ desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 30 2016 we operated through subsidiaries 784 convenience stores 323 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer all 121 of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 78 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 54 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline 

  

s egments 

  

we operate retail food and drug stores multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent over 99 of our consolidated sales and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is our only reportable segment our retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how our chief executive officer who acts as our chief operating decision maker assesses performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below

  

m erchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock over 14000 private label items our corporate brand products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection® is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger® ralphs® fred meyer® king soopers® etc which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before we will carry a “banner brand” product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it pt…® check this out… and heritage farm™ are the three value brands designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition we continue to grow our other brands including simple truth® and simple truth organic® both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers we perform a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 30 2016 we operated 38 food production plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies ten deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants 

  

s easonality

e xecutive officers of the registrant 

  

the disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth in item 10 of part iii of this form 10k under the heading “executive officers of the company” and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

c ompetitive environment 

  

for the disclosure related to our competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k which include forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

c ompetitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

p roduct safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

l abor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 350 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

  

additionally on october 1 2015 the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv transactions as a result before the implementation of the emv technology is complete we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or cash flows 

  

i ndebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

l egal p roceedings and insurance 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

m ultiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

i ntegration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

  

f uel 

  

we sell a significant amount of fuel which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

e conomic conditions 

  

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

w eather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

g overnment regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and the “outlook” section below 

  

o ur business

we operate 38 food production plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 99 of our consolidated sales and ebitda is our only reportable segment

o ur 2015 performance 

  

we achieved outstanding results in 2015 our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical supermarket sales growth increases in loyal household count and good cost control as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share our 2015 net earnings were 20 billion or 206 per diluted share compared to 17 billion or 172 per diluted share for 2014 all share and per share amounts presented are reflective of the twoforone stock split that began trading at the split adjusted price on july 14 2015

  

our net earnings for 2015 include a 110 million expense to operating general and administrative “oga” for certain contributions to the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” consolidated pension plan “2015 ufcw contributions” made during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 in addition our net earnings for 2015 include a lower lastin firstout “lifo” charge compared to 2014 net earnings for 2014 include a net 39 million aftertax charge for an 87 million 56 million aftertax charge to oga due to the commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from restructuring of certain multiemployer obligations “2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation” to help stabilize associates’ future pension benefits offset partially by the benefits from certain tax items of 17 million “2014 adjusted items” in addition our net earnings for 2014 include unusually high fuel margins partially offset by a lifo charge that was significantly higher than 2013 and 140 million in 

  

  

contributions charged to oga expenses for the ufcw consolidated pension plan 55 million and the kroger co foundation 85 million “2014 contributions” the 2015 and 2014 contributions to the ufcw consolidated pension plan was to further fund the plan the 85 million contribution in 2014 to the kroger co foundation will enable it to continue to support causes such as hunger relief breast cancer awareness the military and their families and local community organizations fuel margin per gallon was 019 in 2014 compared to 014 in 2013 our net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million which includes benefits from certain tax items of 40 million offset partially by costs of 11 million in interest and 16 million in oga expenses 17 million aftertax related to our merger with harris teeter “2013 adjusted items” 

  

our 2015 net earnings were 20 billion or 206 per diluted share compared to 17 billion or 172 per diluted share for 2014 net earnings for 2015 totaled 20 billion or 206 per diluted share compared to net earnings in 2014 of 18 billion or 176 per diluted share excluding the 2014 adjusted items we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share present a more accurate yearoveryear comparison of our financial results because the 2014 adjusted items were not the result of our normal operations our net earnings per diluted share for 2015 represent a 17 increase compared to 2014 adjusted net earnings per diluted share please refer to the “net earnings” section of mda for more information 

  

our identical supermarket sales increased 50 excluding fuel in 2015 compared to 2014 we have achieved 49 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as it is a key performance target for our longterm growth strategy 

  

increasing market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen pos data our overall market share of the products we sell in markets in which we operate increased by approximately 40 basis points in 2015 this data also indicates that our market share increased in 17 markets and declined in one these market share results reflect our longterm strategy of market share growth 

  

r esults of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2015 compared to 2014 and for 2014 compared to 2013 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods our merger with roundy’s in late 2015 and our merger with harris teeter in late 2013 all share and per share amounts presented below are reflective of the twoforone stock split that began trading at the split adjusted price on july 14 2015 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they more accurately reflect our daytoday business operations than do the generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are nongenerally accepted accounting principle “nongaap” financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in evaluating our results of operations as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our daytoday operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as a performance metric for management incentive programs and to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 20 billion in 2015 17 billion in 2014 and 15 billion in 2013 net earnings improved in 2015 compared to net earnings in 2014 due to an increase in operating profit partially offset by an increase in income tax expense operating profit increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in firstin firstout “fifo” nonfuel operating profit lower charges for total contributions to the kroger co foundation ufcw consolidated pension plan the charge related to the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation and a lower lifo charge which was 28 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 147 million pretax in 2014 partially offset by a decrease in fuel operating profit and continued investments in lower prices for our customers the decrease in fuel operating profit was primarily due to a decrease in fuel margin per gallon to 017 in 2015 compared to 019 in 2014 partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold c ontinued investments in lower prices for our customers includes our pharmacy department which experienced high levels of inflation that were not fully passed on to the customer in 2015  

  

  

net earnings improved in 2014 compared to net earnings in 2013 due to an increase in operating profit partially offset by increases in interest and income tax expense operating profit increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit excluding harris teeter the effect of our merger with harris teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers the 2014 contributions the charge related to the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation and a higher lifo charge which was 147 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 52 million pretax in 2013 

  

the net earnings for 2015 do not include any nongaap adjustments the net earnings for 2014 include a net charge of 39 million after tax related to the 2014 adjusted items the net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million after tax related to the 2013 adjusted items excluding these benefits and charges for adjusted items for 2014 and 2013 adjusted net earnings were 20 billion in 2015 18 billion in 2014 and 15 billion in 2013 2015 net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2014 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit lower charges for total contributions to the kroger co foundation and ufcw consolidated pension plan and a lower lifo charge which was 28 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 147 million pretax in 2014  partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers a decrease in fuel operating profit and an increase in income tax expense continued investments in lower prices for our customers includes our pharmacy department which experienced high levels of inflation that were not fully passed on to the customer in 2015 2014 adjusted net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2013 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit excluding harris teeter the effect of our merger with harris teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers the 2014 contributions increases in interest and income tax expense and a higher lifo charge which was 147 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 52 million pretax in 2013

  

net earnings per diluted share totaled 206 in 2015 172 in 2014 and 145 in 2013 net earnings per diluted share in 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings net earnings per diluted share in 2014 compared to 2013 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings 

  

there were no adjustment items in 2015 but excluding the 2014 and 2013 adjusted items adjusted net earnings per diluted share totaled 176 in 2014 and 143 in 2013 net earnings per diluted share in 2015 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2014 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2014 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2013 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co to net earnings attributable to the kroger co excluding adjusted items for 2014 and 2013 and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share to the net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share excluding adjusted items for 2014 and 2013 in 2015 we did not have any adjustment items that affect net earnings or net earnings per diluted share

total sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 by 13 this increase in 2015 total sales compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 50 total sales also increased due to the inclusion of roundy’s sales due to our merger for the period of december 18 2015 to january 30 2016 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us an increase in visits per household changes in product mix and product cost inflation total fuel sales decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 267 decrease in the average retail fuel price partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 71 

  

total sales increased in 2014 compared to 2013 by 103 this increase in 2014 total sales compared to 2013 was primarily due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january 28 2014 and an increase in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 52 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2014 compared to 2013 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us an increase in visits per household and product cost inflation total fuel sales decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a 68 decrease in the average retail fuel price partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 66 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores and include roundy’s sales for the last six weeks of fiscal 2015 for stores that are identical as if they were part of the company in the prior year we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below

gross margin and fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2216 in 2015 2116 in 2014 and 2057 in 2013 the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from a decrease in retail fuel sales and reductions in transportation costs and a decrease in our lifo charge as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs as a percentage of sales the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the effect of our merger with harris teeter an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in our lifo charge as a percentage of sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 had a positive effect on our gross margin rate in 2014 since harris teeter has a higher gross margin rate as compared to total company without harris teeter the increase in fuel gross margin rate for 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in fuel margin per gallon sold of 019 in 2014 compared to 014 in 2013 our retail fuel operations lower our gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales a lower growth rate in retail fuel sales as compared to the growth rate for the total company increases the gross margin rates as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year 

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our lifo charge was 28 million in 2015 147 million in 2014 and 52 million in 2013 fifo gross margin is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2218 in 2015 2130 in 2014 and 2062 in 2013 our retail fuel operations lower our fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low fifo gross margin rate on retail fuel as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased four basis points in 2015 as a percentage of sales compared to 2014 the decrease in fifo gross margin rates excluding retail fuel in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs partially offset by a reduction in transportation costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of retail fuel our fifo gross margin rate decreased three basis points in 2014 as a percentage of sales compared to 2013 the decrease in fifo gross margin rates excluding retail fuel in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers offset partially by the effect of our merger with harris teeter and a reduction of warehouse and transportation costs as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 28 million in 2015 147 million in 2014 and 52 million in 2013 in 2015 we experienced lower product cost inflation compared to 2014 which resulted in a lower lifo charge in 2015 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy in 2014 we experienced higher product cost inflation compared to 2013 which resulted in a higher lifo charge in 2014 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy grocery deli meat and seafood in 2013 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to meat seafood and pharmacy 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefits and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1634 in 2015 1582 in 2014 and 1545 in 2013 the increase in oga expenses as a percentage of sales in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from a decrease in retail fuel sales increases in emv chargebacks company sponsored pension healthcare and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by increased supermarket sales the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation lower charges for total contributions to the kroger foundation 

  

  

and ufcw consolidated pension plan productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level  the increase in oga expenses as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the 2014 contributions the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation the effect of fuel the effect of our merger with harris teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by increased supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level retail fuel sales lower our oga rate due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased our oga rate as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher oga rate as compared to the total company without harris teeter

  

our retail fuel operations reduce our overall oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2015 ufcw contributions the 2014 contributions and the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation decreased 9 basis points compared to 2014 the decrease in our adjusted oga rate in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level partially offset by increases in emv chargebacks  company sponsored pension healthcare and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2014 contributions and the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation decreased 19 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 adjusted for the 2013 adjusted items the decrease in our adjusted oga rate in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level offset partially by the effect of our merger with harris teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 723 million in 2015 compared to 707 million in 2014 and 613 million in 2013 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 066 in 2015 compared to 065 in 2014 and 062 in 2013 rent expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the effect of our merger with roundy’s partially offset by our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible rent expense as a percentage of sales in 2015 was consistent with 2014 due to the effect of our merger with roundy’s partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales the increase in rent expense as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased rent expense as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher rent expense rate compared to the total company without harris teeter 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 21 billion compared to 19 billion in 2014 and 17 billion in 2013 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 190 in 2015 180 in 2014 and 173 in 2013 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 compared to 2014 was the result of additional depreciation due to our merger with roundy’s and on capital investments including mergers and lease buyouts of 34 billion excluding roundy’s the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales from 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the additional depreciation resulting from our increased capital investments including mergers and lease buyouts in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 compared to 2013 in total dollars was due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and our increased spending in capital investments including mergers and lease buyouts of 31 billion in 2014 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales from 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and our increased spending in capital investments partially offset by increased supermarket sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased our depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher depreciation expense rate as compared to the total company without harris teeter

  

operating profit and adjusted fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 36 billion in 2015 31 billion in 2014 and 27 billion in 2013 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 326 in 2015 289 in 2014 and 277 in 2013 operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 37 basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily from increased supermarket sales a lifo charge that was significantly lower in 2015 lower charges for total contributions to the kroger co foundation and ufcw consolidated pension plan the 2014 multiemployer pension obligation productivity improvements effective cost controls at the store level and reductions in transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by the effect of our merger with roundy’s continued investments in lower prices for our customers a decrease in operating profit from our fuel operations an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and increases in emv 

  

  

chargebacks company sponsored pension healthcare incentive plan and shrink costs as a percentage of sales the decrease in operating profit from our fuel operations for 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from a decrease in the average margin per gallon of fuel sold partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold  operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 12 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from the effect of our merger with harris teeter an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs rent and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in the lifo charge as a percentage of sales

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness since fuel discounts are earned based on instore purchases fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts which are allocated to our instore supermarket location departments we also derive oga rent and depreciation and amortization expenses through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit 

  

fifo operating profit was 36 billion in 2015 33 billion in 2014 and 28 billion in 2013 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 328 in 2015 303 in 2014 and 282 in 2013 fifo operating profit excluding the 2015 ufcw contributions the 2014 contributions the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation and 2013 adjusted items was 37 billion in 2015 35 billion in 2014 and 28 billion in 2013 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2015 ufcw contributions the 2014 contributions the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation and 2013 adjusted items was 338 in 2015 324 in 2014 and 284 in 2013 

  

retail fuel sales lower our overall fifo operating profit rate due to the very low fifo operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2015 ufcw contributions the 2014 contributions and the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation increased 5 basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in our adjusted fifo operating profit rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased supermarket sales productivity improvements effective cost controls at the store level and reductions in transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers the effect of our merger with roundy’s an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and increases in emv chargebacks company sponsored pension healthcare incentive plan and shrink costs as a percentage of sales   excluding the effects of our merger with roundy’s fifo operating profit increased 8 basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2014 contributions and the 2014 multiemployer pension plan obligation increased 10 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 adjusted for the 2013 adjusted items the increase in our adjusted fifo operating profit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs improvements in oga rent and depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 482 million in 2015 488 million in 2014 and 443 million in 2013 the decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily due to the timing of debt principal payments and debt issuances partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our commercial paper program the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in net total debt primarily due to financing the merger with harris teeter and repurchases of our outstanding common shares 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 338 in 2015 341 in 2014 and 329 in 2013 the 2015 2014 and 2013 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

  

c ommon share repurchase programs 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 500 million in 2015 11 billion in 2014 and 338 million in 2013 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase 

  

  

programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 203 million in 2015 155 million in 2014 and 271 million in 2013 of our common shares under the stock option program 

  

the shares repurchased in 2015 were acquired under two separate share repurchase programs the first is a 500 million repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on june 26 2014 the second is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in our stock option and longterm incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits on june 25 2015 our board of directors approved a new 500 million share repurchase program to replace our prior authorization which had been exhausted as of january 30 2016 we have not repurchased any shares utilizing the june 25 2015 repurchase program on march 10 2016 our board of directors approved a new 500 million share repurchase program to supplement the 2015 repurchase program which is expected to be exhausted by the end of the second quarter of 2016

  

c apital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 33 billion in 2015 28 billion in 2014 and 23 billion in 2013 capital investments for mergers totaled 168 million in 2015 252 million in 2014 and 23 billion in 2013 payments for mergers of 168 million in 2015 252 million in 2014 and 23 billion in 2013 relate to our mergers with roundy’s vitacostcom and harris teeter respectively refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the mergers with roundy’s vitacostcom and harris teeter capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 35 million in 2015 135 million in 2014 and 108 million in 2013 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage

r eturn on i nvested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our us gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

  

  

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2015 and 2014 the 2015 calculation of roic excludes the financial position results and merger costs for the roundy’s transaction 

  

   

   

  

c ritical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 30 2016 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 2 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 46 million in 2015 37 million in 2014 and 39 million in 2013 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 27 billion as of january 30 2016 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

in 2015 goodwill increased 420 million primarily due to our merger with roundy’s in 2014 goodwill increased 169 million primarily due to our merger with vitacostcom for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for roundy’s and vitacostcom refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2015 2014 and 2013 did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 15 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 462 and 444 discount rates as of yearend 2015 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 387 and 374 as of yearend 2014 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 30 2016 by approximately 438 million 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for 2015 we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in 2015 our assumed pension plan investment return rate was 744 compared to 744 in 2014 and 850 in 2013 our pension plans’ average rate of return was 647 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2015 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2015 net of investment management fees and expenses decreased 080 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 799 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe a 744 rate of return assumption is reasonable for 2015 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

on january 31 2015 we adopted new mortality tables including industrybased tables for annuitants reflecting more current mortality experience and assumptions for future generational mortality improvement in calculating our projected benefit obligations as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 and our 2015 pension expense the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increased our benefit obligation and future expenses we used the rp2000 projected to 2021 mortality table in calculating our 2013 year end pension obligation and 2014 and 2013 pension expense 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

in 2015 we contributed 5 million to our companysponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to these plans in 2016 in 2014 we did not contribute to our companysponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2015 we did not make a contribution in 2014 and contributed 100 million in 2013 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions

  

we contributed and expensed 196 million in 2015 177 million in 2014 and 148 million in 2013 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to a higher employee savings rate the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans including the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements we are designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

in 2015 we contributed 190 million to the ufcw consolidated pension plan we had previously accrued 60 million of the total contributions at january 31 2015 and recorded expense for the remaining 130 million at the time of payment in 2015 in 2014 we incurred a charge of 56 million aftertax related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements of which 15 million was contributed to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in 2014 as of january 30 2016 we are not required to contribute to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in 2016 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 426 million in 2015 297 million in 2014 and 228 million in 2013 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2015 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of december 31 2015 we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which we contribute was approximately 29 billion pretax or 18 billion aftertax which includes roundy’s share of underfunding of its multiemployer plans this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 11 billion pretax or approximately 680 million aftertax as of december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans during 2015 changes in mortality rate assumptions and the merger of roundy’s our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2016 we expect to contribute approximately 260 million to multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 30 2016 the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of our 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns tax years 2012 and 2013 remain under examination 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 95 of inventories in 2015 and 2014 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 13 billion at january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold t he itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 73 billion in 2015 69 billion in 2014 and 62 billion in 2013 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 91 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

  

r ecently a dopted a ccounting standards 

  

in 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended accounting standards codification 835 “interestimputation of interest” the amendment simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability by requiring it be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts this amendment became effective beginning february 1 2015 and was adopted retrospectively in accordance with the standard the adoption of this amendment resulted in amounts previously reported in other assets to now be reported within longterm debt including obligations under capital leases and financing obligations in the consolidated balance sheets these amounts were not material to the prior year the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

r ecently i ssued a ccounting standards 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services per asu 201514 “deferral of effective date” this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february 2 2019 early adoption is permitted as of the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february 3 2018 we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201504 “retirement benefits topic 715 practical expedient for the measurement date of an employer’s defined benefit obligation and plan assets” this amendment permits an entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal year end for all plans this guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending january 28 2017 the implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our consolidated statements of operations and will not have a significant effect on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201507 “fair value measurement topic 820 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” this amendment removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share this guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending january 28 2017 the implementation of this amendment will have an effect on our notes to the consolidated financial statements and will not have an effect on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheets 

  

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 “business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” this amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination this guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending january 28 2017 the implementation of this amendment is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” this amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position this guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending january 28 2017 early adoption is permitted the implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our consolidated statements of operations and will not have a significant effect on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements the standard’s core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding rightofuse assets this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending february 1 2020 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this asu will result in a significant increase to our consolidated balance sheets for lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial statements we believe our current offbalance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating 

  

  

l iquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 48 billion of cash from operations in 2015 compared to 42 billion in 2014 and 36 billion in 2013 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense for companysponsored pension plans the lifo charge and changes in working capital 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests an increase in noncash items and changes in working capital the increase in noncash items in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and expense for companysponsored pension plans partially offset by a lower lifo charge 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests which include the results of harris teeter an increase in noncash items a reduction in contributions to companysponsored pension plans and changes in working capital the increase in noncash items in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and the lifo charge the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests 

  

cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 96 million in 2015 compared to 49 million in 2014 and 63 million in 2013 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by trade accounts payables and store deposits in transit partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by income taxes receivable and payable the increase in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for receivables and a decrease in cash provided by trade accounts payables partially offset by an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 36 billion in 2015 compared to 31 billion in 2014 and 48 billion in 2013 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased payments for capital investments partially offset by lower payments for mergers the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to decreased payments for mergers offset primarily by increased payments for capital investments capital investments including payments for lease buyouts but excluding mergers were 33 billion in 2015 28 billion in 2014 and 23 billion in 2013 merger payments were 168 million in 2015 252 million in 2014 and 23 billion in 2013 merger payments decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our merger with harris teeter in 2013 refer to the “capital investments” section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash provided used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used provided cash of 13 billion in 2015 12 billion in 2014 and 14 billion in 2013 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to increased payments on longterm debt and commercial paper partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of longterm debt and decreased treasury stock purchases the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily related to decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and increased treasury stock purchases offset partially by decreased payments on longterm debt proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt were 12 billion in 2015 576 million in 2014 and 35 billion in 2013 net payments borrowings provided from our commercial paper program were 285 million in 2015 25 million in 2014 and 395 million in 2013 please refer to the “debt management” section of mda for additional information we repurchased 703 million of kroger common shares in 2015 compared to 13 billion in 2014 and 609 million in 2013 we paid dividends totaling 385 million in 2015 338 million in 2014 and 319 million in 2013 

  

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 481 million to 121 billion as of yearend 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from the issuance of i 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 200 ii 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 260 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 350 and iv an increase in capital lease obligations due to our merger with roundy’s and various leased locations partially offset by payments of 678 million on longterm debt obligations assumed as part of our merger with roundy’s and 500 million of payments at maturity of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 390 the increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with roundy’s 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 346 million to 117 billion as of yearend 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from i the issuance of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 295 and ii an increase in commercial paper of 25 million partially offset by payments at maturity of 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 495 the increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to range from 66 to 69 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2015 we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 990 million of commercial paper and 13 billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the range of 66 to 69 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in 2016 by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the company’s share repurchase programs we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at january 30 2016 we had 990 million of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march 23 2016 we had 11 billion of cp borrowings outstanding the increase as of march 23 2016 compared to yearend 2015 was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 197 to 1 as of january 30 2016 if this ratio were to exceed 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 530 to 1 as of january 30 2016 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired

  

our credit agreement is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2015 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 30 2016 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

as of january 30 2016 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on june 30 2019 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement as of january 30 2016 we had 990 million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 13 million as of january 30 2016 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 30 2016 we had authorized for issuance 900 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 13 2013 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which 

  

  

could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

  

o utlook 

  

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about our future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it such statements are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially the guidance below includes our expectations for roundy’s 

  

·   we expect net earnings to be 219 to 228 per diluted share which is essentially in line with our longterm net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8  11 where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by actual fuel margins which we expect to be at or slightly below the fiveyear average with continued volatility we expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with our longterm net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8 – 11

  

·   we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of 2535 in 2016 reflecting the lower inflationary environment

  

·   we expect fullyear fifo operating margin in 2016 excluding fuel to expand slightly compared to 2015 results

  

·   we expect capital investments excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be 41 to 44 billion these capital investments include approximately 100 major projects covering new stores expansions and relocations including 10 ruler locations 200 to 220 major remodels and other investments including minor remodels and technology and infrastructure to support our customer 1 st business strategy

  

·   we expect total supermarket square footage for 2016 to grow approximately 30  35 before mergers acquisitions and operational closings

  

·   we expect 2016 yearend roic to increase slightly compared to the 2015 result

  

·   we expect the 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 35 excluding the resolution of certain tax items

  

·   in 2016 we anticipate annualized product cost inflation of 10 to 20 excluding fuel and an annualized lifo charge of approximately 50 million we expect inflation to be lower during the earlier portion of 2016 and to gradually rise during the later portion of 2016

  

·   we expect 2016 companysponsored pension plans expense to be approximately 80 million we do not expect to make a cash contribution in 2016

  

·   in 2016 we expect to contribute approximately 260 million to multiemployer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made

  

·   in 2016 we will negotiate agreements with ufcw for store associates in houston indianapolis little rock nashville portland southern california and fry’s in arizona negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits

  

  

various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these include 

  

·   the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets

  

·   our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending volatility of fuel margins changes in governmentfunded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors consolidation in the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit managers our ability to negotiate modifications to multiemployer pension plans natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyberattacks or data security breaches the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter and roundy’s our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow

  

·   during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by estimated yearend changes in product costs our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at yearend

  

·   if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units’ goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized

  

·   our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses

  

·   changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since fuel generates lower profit margins than our supermarket sales we expect to see our fifo gross margins decline as fuel sales increase

  

we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger’s business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2016 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives we undertake no obligation to update the forwardlooking information contained in this filing 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 30 2016 we maintained two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount totaling 100 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature in december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

as of january 30 2016 we maintained 7 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of august 15 2027 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 400 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year 2017 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 254 to 300 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of january 30 2016 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other longterm liabilities for 29 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 17 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

   

   

   

based on our yearend 2015 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our food production plants and energy to be used in our stores warehouses food production plants and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

m anagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 item 1   business 

  

the kroger co the “company” or “kroger” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 31 2015 we are one of the largest retailers in the nation based on annual sales we also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets our principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and our telephone number is 513 7624000 we maintain a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and our interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2014 2013 and 2012 are to the fiscal years ended january 31 2015 february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2015 kroger employed approximately 400000 full and parttime employees a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 300 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

stores 

  

as of january 31 2015 kroger operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2625 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 1330 of which had fuel centers approximately 48 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land our current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate our stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 31 2015 we operated through subsidiaries 782 convenience stores 326 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer all 132 of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 78 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 54 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline 

  

segments 

  

we operate retail food and drug stores multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states our retail operations which represent over 99 of our consolidated sales and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is our only reportable segment our retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition our operating divisions offer customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location our operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how our chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as our chief operating decision makers assess performance internally all of our operations are domestic revenues profits and losses and total assets are shown in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately 13000 private label items our corporate brand products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection® is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger® ralphs® fred meyer® king soopers® etc which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before we will carry a “banner brand” product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it pt…® check this out… and heritage farm™ are the three value brands designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition we continue to grow our other brands including simple truth® and simple truth organic® both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers we perform a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 31 2015 we operated 37 manufacturing plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies nine deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants 

  

seasonality

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below the following information should be read together with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k which include forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive expansion increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items we sell regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or with the permission of the individual although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

  

indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings and insurance 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and the “litigation” section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be responsible for the shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

integration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

fuel 

  

we sell a significant amount of gasoline which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

economic conditions 

  

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 2   properties 

  

as of january 31 2015 we operated approximately 3800 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and manufacturing plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while our current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct our business are leased 

  

we generally own store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and manufacturing equipment the total cost of our owned assets and capitalized leases at january 31 2015 was 345 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 166 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution manufacturing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success we believe that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we continually evaluate our exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties we currently believe that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material it remains possible that despite our current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in our evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and “outlook” below 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 kroger is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2625 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons food 4 less fred meyer fry’s harris teeter jay c king soopers qfc ralphs and smith’s of these stores 1330 have fuel centers we also operate 782 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees 326 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer 

  

we operate 37 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 99 of our consolidated sales and ebitda is our only reportable segment 

  

on january 28 2014 we closed our merger with harris teeter by purchasing 100 of the harris teeter outstanding common stock for approximately 24 billion the merger allows us to expand into the fastgrowing southeastern and midatlantic markets and into washington dc harris teeter is included in our ending consolidated balance sheets for 2013 and 2014 and in our consolidated statements of operations for 2014 due to the timing of the merger closing late in fiscal year 2013 its results of operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations for 2013 yearoveryear comparisons will be affected as a result see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our merger with harris teeter 

  

on august 18 2014 we closed our merger with vitacostcom by purchasing 100 of the vitacostcom outstanding common stock for 800 per share or 287 million vitacostcom is a leading online retailer in health and wellness products which are sold directly to consumers through the website vitacostcom the merger affords us access to vitacostcom’s extensive ecommerce platform which can be combined with our customer insights and loyal customer base to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers vitacostcom is included in our ending consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations for 2014 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our merger with vitacostcom 

  

our 2014 performance 

  

we achieved outstanding results in 2014 our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count and good cost control as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share our 2014 net earnings were 17 billion or 344 per diluted share compared to 15 billion or 290 per diluted share for the same period of 2013 

  

our net earnings for 2014 include a net 39 million aftertax charge for an 87 million 56 million aftertax charge to operating general and administrative “oga” expenses due to the commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from restructuring of certain pension plan agreements to help stabilize associates’ future pension benefits offset partially by the benefits from certain tax items 17 million “2014 adjusted items” in addition our net earnings for 2014 included unusually high fuel margins partially offset by a lastin firstout “lifo” charge that was significantly higher than 2013 and 140 million in contributions charged to oga expenses for the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” consolidated pension plan 55 million and our charitable foundation 85 million “2014 contributions” fuel margin per gallon was 019 per gallon in 2014 compared to 014 per gallon in 2013 the 55 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan was to further fund the plan the 85 million contribution to kroger’s charitable foundation will enable it to continue to support causes such as hunger relief breast cancer awareness the military and their families and local community organizations our net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million which includes benefits from certain tax items of 40 million offset partially by costs of 11 million in interest and 16 million in oga expenses 17 million aftertax related to our merger with harris teeter “2013 adjusted items” 

  

  

excluding the 2014 adjusted items net earnings for 2014 totaled 18 billion or 352 per diluted share compared to net earnings in 2013 of 15 billion or 285 per diluted share excluding the 2013 adjusted items we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share present a more accurate yearoveryear comparison of our financial results because the adjusted items were not the result of our normal operations our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for 2014 represent a 24 increase compared to 2013 please refer to the “net earnings” section of mda for more information 

  

our identical supermarket sales increased 52 excluding fuel in 2014 compared to 2013 we have achieved 45 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as it is a key performance target for our longterm growth strategy 

  

increasing market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen pos data our overall market share of the products we sell in markets in which we operate increased by approximately 60 basis points in 2014 this data also indicates that our market share increased in 18 markets and declined slightly in two walmart is one of our top two competitors in 15 of the 20 markets outlined in the nielson report our market share increased in all 15 of these markets these market share results reflect our longterm strategy of market share growth 

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2014 compared to 2013 and for 2013 compared to 2012 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods our merger with harris teeter in late 2013 and an extra week in 2012 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 17 billion in 2014 and 15 billion in 2013 and 2012 net earnings improved in 2014 compared to net earnings in 2013 due to an increase in operating profit partially offset by increases in interest and tax expense operating profit increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in firstin firstout “fifo” nonfuel gross profit excluding harris teeter the effect of our merger with harris teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers the 2014 contributions an 87 million 56 million aftertax charge due to the restructuring of certain pension plan agreements and a higher lifo charge which was 147 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 52 million pretax in 2013 net earnings improved in 2013 compared to net earnings of 2012 due to a decrease in tax and interest expense partially offset by a decrease in operating profit operating profit decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2012 the “extra week” continued investments in lower prices for our customers the 2012 settlement with visa and mastercard and the reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension plan created in 2012 partially offset by an increase in fifo nonfuel gross profit 

  

the net earnings for 2014 include a net charge of 39 million after tax related to the 2014 adjusted items the net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million after tax related to the 2013 adjusted items the net earnings for 2012 include a benefit from net earnings of approximately 58 million aftertax due to the extra week and a net 115 million 74 million aftertax benefit in oga expenses for the settlement with visa and mastercard and a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension plan created in january 2012 “2012 adjusted items” excluding these benefits and charges for adjusted items for 2014 2013 and 2012 adjusted net earnings were 18 billion in 2014 15 billion in 2013 and 14 billion in 2012 2014 adjusted net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2013 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit excluding harris teeter the effect of our merger with harris teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers increases in interest and tax expense and a higher lifo charge which was 147 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 52 million pretax in 2013 2013 adjusted net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2012 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit and decreased interest partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased tax expense 

  

net earnings per diluted share totaled 344 in 2014 290 in 2013 and 277 in 2012 net earnings per diluted share in 2014 compared to 2013 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings net earnings per diluted share in 2013 compared to 2012 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings 

  

  

excluding the 2014 2013 and 2012 adjusted items adjusted net earnings per diluted share totaled 352 in 2014 285 in 2013 and 252 in 2012 adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2014 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2013 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2013 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2012 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they more accurately reflect our daytoday business operations than do the generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are nongenerally accepted accounting principle “nongaap” financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in evaluating our results of operations as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our daytoday operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as a performance metric for management incentive programs and to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co to net earnings attributable to the kroger co excluding the adjusted items for 2014 2013 and 2012 and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share to the net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share excluding the adjusted items for 2014 2013 and 2012

total sales increased in 2014 compared to 2013 by 103 this increase in 2014 total sales compared to 2013 was primarily due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january 28 2014 and an increase in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 52 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for 2014 compared to 2013 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us an increase in visits per household and product cost inflation total fuel sales decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a 68 decrease in the average retail fuel price partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 66 

  

total sales increased in 2013 compared to 2012 by 182 the increase in 2013 total sales compared to 2012 was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 36 partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2012 total sales increased in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted total sales by 39 the increase in 2013 total sales compared to 2012 adjusted total sales was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 36 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in number of households shopping with us an increase in visits per household and product cost inflation total fuel sales increased in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted total sales primarily due to an increase in fuel gallons sold of 52 partially offset by a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 29 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores and include harris teeter sales for stores that are identical as if they were part of the company in our prior year we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below 

  

identical supermarket sales 

dollars in millions 

  

   

1   identical supermarket sales for 2013 were calculated on a 52 week basis by excluding week 1 of fiscal 2012 in our 2012 identical supermarket sales base 

  

  

gross margin and fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2116 in 2014 2057 in 2013 and 2059 in 2012 the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the effect of our merger with harris teeter an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in our lifo charge as a percentage of sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 had a positive effect on our gross margin rate in 2014 since harris teeter has a higher gross margin rate as compared to total company without harris teeter the increase in fuel gross margin rate for 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in fuel margin per gallon sold of 019 in 2014 compared to 014 in 2013 the decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales offset partially by a growth rate in retail fuel sales that was lower than the total company sales growth rate our retail fuel operations lower our gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales a lower growth rate in retail fuel sales as compared to the growth rate for the total company increases the gross margin rates as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year 

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our lifo charge was 147 million in 2014 52 million in 2013 and 55 million in 2012 fifo gross margin is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2130 in 2014 2062 in 2013 and 2065 in 2012 our retail fuel operations lower our fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low fifo gross margin rate on retail fuel as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel our fifo gross margin rate decreased three basis points in 2014 as a percentage of sales compared to 2013 the decrease in fifo gross margin rates excluding retail fuel in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers offset partially by the effect of our merger with harris teeter and a reduction of warehouse and transportation costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased 14 basis points in 2013 as a percentage of sales compared to 2012 the decrease in fifo gross margin rates excluding retail fuel in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 147 million in 2014 52 million in 2013 and 55 million in 2012 in 2014 we experienced higher levels of product cost inflation compared to 2013 in 2014 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy grocery deli meat and seafood we experienced relatively consistent levels of product cost inflation in 2013 compared to 2012 in 2013 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to meat seafood and pharmacy in 2012 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery natural foods meat deli and bakery general merchandise and grocery partially offset by deflation in seafood and manufactured product 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

oga expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefits and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1582 in 2014 1545 in 2013 and 1537 in 2012 the increase in oga expenses as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the 2014 contributions expenses related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from restructuring of certain pension plan agreements to help stabilize associates future pension benefits the effect of fuel the effect of our merger with harris teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by increased supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level retail fuel sales lower our oga rate due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased our oga rate as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher oga rate as compared to the total company without harris teeter the increase in oga rate in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from the 2012 settlement with visa and mastercard and a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension plan created in january 2012 the effect of fuel and increased incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales offset partially by increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level 

  

our retail fuel operations reduce our overall oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2014 contributions and the 2014 adjusted items decreased 19 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 adjusted for the 2013 adjusted items the decrease in our adjusted oga rate in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level offset partially by the effect of our merger with harris teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2013 adjusted items decreased 17 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted for the 2012 adjusted items the decrease in our adjusted oga rate in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level offset partially by increased incentive plan costs as a percentage of sales 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 707 million in 2014 compared to 613 million in 2013 and 628 million in 2012 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 065 in 2014 compared to 062 in 2013 and 065 in 2012 the increase in rent expense as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased rent expense as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher rent expense rate compared to the total company without harris teeter the decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales in 2013 compared to 2012 is due to our continued emphasis to own rather than lease whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 19 billion compared to 17 billion in 2013 and 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 180 in 2014 173 in 2013 and 171 in 2012 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 compared to 2013 in total dollars was due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and our increased spending in capital investments including acquisitions and lease buyouts of 31 billion in 2014 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales from 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and our increased spending in capital investments partially offset by increased supermarket sales the merger with harris teeter which closed late in fiscal year 2013 increased our depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales since harris teeter has a higher depreciation expense rate as compared to the total company without harris teeter the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales from 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily the result of increased spending in capital investments partially offset by increases in supermarket sales and the extra week 

  

operating profit and adjusted fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 31 billion in 2014 27 billion in 2013 and 28 billion in 2012 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 289 in 2014 277 in 2013 and 286 in 2012 operating profit as a percentage of sales increased 12 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from the effect of our merger with harris teeter an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs rent and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in the lifo charge as a percentage of sales operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased 9 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers the 2012 settlement with visa and mastercard and the reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension plan created in january 2012 and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by productivity improvements effective cost controls at store level and a reduction in rent expense as a percentage of sales 

  

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness since fuel discounts are earned based on instore purchases fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts which are allocated to our instore supermarket location departments we also derive oga rent and depreciation and amortization expenses through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit 

  

fifo operating profit was 33 billion in 2014 and 28 billion in 2013 and 2012 excluding the extra week in 2012 fifo operating profit was 27 billion fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 303 in 2014 282 in 2013 and 292 in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week in 2012 was 287 fifo operating profit excluding the 2014 2013 and 2012 adjusted items and the 2014 contributions was 35 billion in 2014 28 billion in 2013 and 26 billion in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2014 2013 and 2012 adjusted items and the 2014 contributions was 324 in 2014 284 in 2013 and 275 in 2012 

  

retail fuel sales lower our overall fifo operating profit rate due to the very low fifo operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the 2014 contributions and the 2014 adjusted items increased 10 basis points in 2014 compared to 2013 adjusted for the 2013 adjusted items the increase in our adjusted fifo operating profit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs improvements in oga rent and depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2013 adjusted items increased 11 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted for the 2012 adjusted items the increase in our adjusted fifo operating profit rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to improvements in oga and rent expenses as a percentage of sales offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 488 million in 2014 443 million in 2013 and 462 million in 2012 the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in net total debt primarily due to financing the merger with harris teeter and repurchases of our outstanding common shares the decrease in interest expense in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate offset partially by a decrease in the net benefit from interest rate swaps and the extra week 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 341 in 2014 329 in 2013 and 345 in 2012 the 2014 and 2013 tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2013 benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction was greater than 2014 and 2012 due to the amendment of prior years’ tax returns to claim additional benefit available in years still under review by the internal revenue service the 2012 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes 

  

common share repurchase programs 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling 11 billion in 2014 338 million in 2013 and 12 billion in 2012 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 155 million in 2014 271 million in 2013 and 96 million in 2012 of our common shares under the stock option program 

  

  

the shares repurchased in 2014 were acquired under three separate share repurchase programs the first is a 500 million repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on october 16 2012 the second is a 1 billion repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on march 13 2014 that replaced the first referenced program the third is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in our stock option and longterm incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits on june 26 2014 we announced a new 500 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors replacing the 1 billion repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on march 13 2014 as of january 31 2015 we have not repurchased any shares utilizing the june 26 2014 repurchase program 

  

capital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 28 billion in 2014 23 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2012 capital investments for acquisitions totaled 252 million in 2014 23 billion in 2013 and 122 million in 2012 payments for acquisitions of 23 billion in 2013 relate to our merger with harris teeter refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the merger with harris teeter capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 135 million in 2014 108 million in 2013 and 73 million in 2012 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures excluding certain adjustments to operating profit 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

  

  

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2014 and 2013 the calculation of the numerator in the table below only includes harris teeter in 2014 the calculation of the denominator excludes the assets and liabilities recorded as of february 1 2014 for harris teeter due to the merger being completed at the end of 2013  in millions 

  

   

1   taxes receivable were 20 as of january 31 2015 18 as of february 1 2014 and 2 as of february 2 2013 

2   other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 5 as of january 31 2015 92 as of february 1 2014 and 128 as of february 2 2013 accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

3   harris teeter’s invested capital has been excluded from the calculation for 2013 due to the merger being completed at the end of 2013 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 31 2015 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 2 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 37 million in 2014 39 million in 2013 and 18 million in 2012 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 23 billion as of january 31 2015 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively “reporting units” that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

in 2014 goodwill increased 160 million due to our merger with vitacostcom which closed on august 18 2014 in addition goodwill increased 9 million in 2014 and 901 million in 2013 due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january 28 2014 for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for vitacostcom and harris teeter refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2014 2013 and 2012 did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2014 2013 and 2012 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 15 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 387 and 374 discount rates as of yearend 2014 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 499 and 468 as of yearend 2013 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 31 2015 by approximately 500 million 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for 2014 we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in 2014 we decreased our assumed pension plan investment return rate to 744 compared to 850 in 2013 and 2012 our pension plan’s average rate of return was 758 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2014 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2014 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 565 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 958 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe a 744 rate of return assumption is reasonable for 2014 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

on january 31 2015 we adopted new mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in calculating our 2014 year end pension obligation the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increase our benefit obligation and future expenses we used the rp2000 projected 2021 mortality table in calculating our 2013 year end pension obligation and 2014 2013 and 2012 pension expense 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

in 2014 we did not contribute to our companysponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2015 we contributed 100 million in 2013 and 71 million in 2012 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions 

  

we contributed and expensed 177 million in 2014 148 million in 2013 and 140 million in 2012 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the increase in 2014 is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we contribute to various multiemployer pension plans including the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements we are designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets these multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

in the first quarter of 2014 we incurred a charge of 56 million aftertax related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements of which 15 million was contributed to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in 2014 we are required to contribute an additional 75 million over the next four years related to the restructuring of these pension plan agreements 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 297 million in 2014 228 million in 2013 and 492 million in 2012 the cash contributions for 2012 include our 258 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2012 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2014 because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer except as noted above as of december 31 2014 we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which we contribute was 18 billion pretax or 12 billion aftertax this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 200 million pretax or 130 million aftertax as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans during 2014 our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2015 we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 31 2015 the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of our 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns tax years 2010 through 2013 remain under examination 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 95 of inventories in 2014 and 2013 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 12 billion at january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 69 billion in 2014 and 62 billion in 2013 and 2012 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 93 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure of information about amounts reclassified out of aoci by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income in which the item was reclassified if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it requires cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period this new disclosure became effective for us beginning february 3 2013 and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our disclosures related to this amended standard 

  

in july 2013 the fasb amended accounting standards codification 740 “income taxes” the amendment provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either a reduction of a deferred tax asset or as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists this amendment became effective for us beginning february 2 2014 and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on net income and did not have a significant effect on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in may 2014 fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending january 27 2018 early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this asu on the consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 42 billion of cash from operations in 2014 compared to 36 billion in 2013 and 30 billion in 2012 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization the lifo charge and changes in working capital the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests which include the results of harris teeter an increase in noncash items a reduction in contributions to companysponsored pension plans and changes in working capital the increase in noncash items in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and the lifo charge 

  

cash provided used by operating activities for changes in working capital was 49 million in 2014 compared to 63 million in 2013 and 211 million in 2012 the increase in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for receivables and a decrease in cash provided by trade accounts payables partially offset by an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily due to changes in working capital and longterm liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for deposits intransit prepaid expenses and receivables the use of cash for the payment of longterm liabilities decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to our funding of the remaining unfunded actuarial accrued liability for the ufcw consolidated pension plan in 2012 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to additional deductions taken in 2012 related to the funding of our pension contributions and union health benefits 

  

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 31 billion in 2014 compared to 48 billion in 2013 and 22 billion in 2012 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to decreased payments for acquisitions offset primarily by increased payments for capital investments the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased payments for capital investments and acquisitions capital investments including payments for lease buyouts and excluding acquisitions were 28 billion in 2014 23 billion in 2013 and 21 billion in 2012 acquisitions were 252 million in 2014 23 billion in 2013 and 122 million in 2012 the decrease in payments for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013 and the increase in payments for acquisitions in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to our merger with harris teeter in 2013 refer to the “capital investments” section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash provided used by financing activities 

  

financing activities provided used cash of 12 billion in 2014 14 billion in 2013 and 721 million in 2012 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily related to decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and increased treasury stock purchases offset partially by decreased payments on longterm debt the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily related to increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt primarily to finance our merger with harris teeter and a reduction in payments on longterm debt and treasury stock purchases offset partially by net payments on our commercial paper program proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt were 576 million in 2014 35 billion in 2013 and 863 million in 2012 net borrowings payments provided from our commercial paper program were 25 million in 2014 395 million in 2013 and 13 billion in 2012 please refer to the “debt management” section of mda for additional information we repurchased 13 billion of kroger common shares in 2014 compared to 609 million in 2013 and 13 billion in 2012 we paid dividends totaling 338 million in 2014 319 million in 2013 and 267 million in 2012 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 346 million to 117 billion as of yearend 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the issuance of i 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 295 and ii an increase in commercial paper of 25 million partially offset by payments at maturity of 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 495 the increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 24 billion to 113 billion as of yearend 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted from the issuance of i 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 385 ii 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 515 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3month london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 53 basis points iv 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 12 v 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 23 vi 700 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 33 and vii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 40 offset partially by a reduction in commercial paper of 395 million and payments at maturity of 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 and 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 75 this increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with harris teeter refinancing our debt maturities in 2013 and replacing the senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2012 offset partially by the payment at maturity of our 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 75 and a reduction in commercial paper of 395 million 

  

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to be approximately 52 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2014 based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 13 billion of commercial paper and 500 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the 52 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in 2015 by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the company’s share repurchase programs we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 275 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at january 31 2015 we had 13 billion of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march 27 2015 we had 10 billion of cp borrowings outstanding the decrease as of march 27 2015 compared to yearend 2014 was due to applying cash from operations against our yearend cp outstanding borrowings 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 206 to 1 as of january 31 2015 if this ratio were to exceed 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio 

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 499 to 1 as of january 31 2015 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 

  

our credit agreement is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2014 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 31 2015 in millions of dollars 

  

   

1   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 25 million in 2014 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 297 million in 2014 

2   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 

3   as of january 31 2015 we had 13 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement 

4   amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january 31 2015 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments 

5   the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability related to workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis 

6   amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

7   amounts include commitments many of which are shortterm in nature to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 31 2015 we maintained a 275 billion with the ability to increase by 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on june 30 2019 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement as of january 31 2015 we had 13 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 10 million as of january 31 2015 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 31 2015 we had authorized for issuance 2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 13 2013 

  

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

  

outlook 

  

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about our future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it such statements are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

·   we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of 380390 for fiscal year 2015 which is consistent with our longterm net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8 — 11 growing off of 2014 adjusted net earnings of 352 per diluted share 

  

·   we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of 3040 in fiscal year 2015 

  

·   we expect fullyear fifo nonfuel operating margin for 2015 to expand slightly compared to 2014 excluding the 2014 adjusted items 

  

·   for 2015 we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately 75 million 

  

·   for 2015 we expect interest expense to be approximately 480 million 

  

·   we plan to use cash flow primarily to maintain our current investment grade debt rating fund capital investments fund our cash dividend and repurchase shares of common stock 

  

·   we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 

  

·   we expect capital investments excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be 30  33 billion we expect total food store square footage for 2015 to grow approximately 20  25 before mergers acquisitions and operational closings 

  

·   for 2015 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 350 excluding the resolution of certain tax items and potential changes to tax legislation 

  

·   we do not anticipate goodwill impairments in 2015 

  

·   for 2015 we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to multiemployer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

·   in 2015 we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in columbus denver las vegas louisville memphis and portland and agreements with the teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits 

  

  

various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these include 

  

·   the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets 

  

·   our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares fund dividends and increase capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings 

  

·   our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending volatility of fuel margins changes in governmentfunded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors consolidation in the health care industry including pharmacy benefit managers our ability to negotiate modifications to multiemployer pension plans natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyberattacks or data security breaches the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above 

  

·   our capital investments could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if economic conditions fail to improve or worsen 

  

·   during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by estimated yearend changes in product costs our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at yearend 

  

·   if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units’ goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized 

  

·   our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 

  

·   changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 

  

we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger’s business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2015 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives we undertake no obligation to update the forwardlooking information contained in this filing 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 31 2015 we maintained two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount totaling 100 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature in december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

as of january 31 2015 we maintained 11 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between october 2015 and august 2017 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 700 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 228 to 300 the variable rate component on the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of january 31 2015 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other longterm liabilities for 39 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 25 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 see notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

   

   

   

based on our yearend 2014 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

the kroger co the “company” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 1 2014 the company was one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales the company also manufactures and processes some of the food for sale in its supermarkets the company’s principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and its telephone number is 513 7624000 the company maintains a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company the company makes available through its web site free of charge its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q its current reports on form 8k and its interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the company has filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

the company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its stores the company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to its customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses the company’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 all references to 2013 2012 and 2011 are to the fiscal years ended february 1 2014 february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 respectively unless specifically indicated otherwise 

  

employees 

  

as of february 1 2014 the company employed approximately 375000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 300 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

stores 

  

as of february 1 2014 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2640 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 1240 of which had fuel centers approximately 45 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys 

  

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of february 1 2014 the company operated through subsidiaries 786 convenience stores and 320 fine jewelry stores all 144 of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 83 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 54 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline

corporate brand products play an important role in the company’s merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately 13000 private label items the company’s corporate brand products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the company’s private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it kroger value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition the company continues to grow its other brands including simple truth and simple truth organic both simple truth and simple truth organic are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic

for the disclosure related to the company’s competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that kroger sells could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2014 covering store employees in cincinnati atlanta southern california new mexico richmondhampton roads west virginia and arizona and an agreement with teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

strategy execution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experiences through improved service product quality and selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or with the permission of the individual although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate or a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

indebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2013 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 113 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that the company’s contributions to those funds excluding all payments to the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would adversely affect kroger’s cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be responsible for the shortfall which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

integration of new business 

  

we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including among other things operating efficiencies procurement savings innovation sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

insurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

fuel 

  

we sell a significant amount of gasoline which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases the effect on the environment could be manifested by extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels we are unable to predict future regulations environmental effects political unrest acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel and how our customers will react which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

current economic conditions 

  

the economic recovery remains fragile and uneven our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions changes in housing market conditions the availability of credit interest rates tax rates the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

none 

  




 item 2   properties 

  

as of february 1 2014 the company operated more than 3800 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and manufacturing plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while the company’s current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct the company’s business are leased 

  

the company generally owns store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and manufacturing equipment the total cost of the company’s owned assets and capitalized leases at february 1 2014 was 324 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 155 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution manufacturing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material to the company it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” section set forth in part i the “risk factors” section set forth in item 1a of part i and “outlook” below 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2640 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons food 4 less fred meyer fry’s harris teeter jay c king soopers qfc ralphs and smith’s of these stores 1240 have fuel centers we also operate 786 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees and 320 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 38 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 99 of kroger’s consolidated sales and ebitda are our only reportable segment 

  

on january 28 2014 we closed our merger with harris teeter supermarkets inc “harris teeter” by purchasing 100 of the harris teeter outstanding common stock for approximately 24 billion the merger allows us to expand into the fastgrowing southeastern and midatlantic markets and into washington dc harris teeter is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet but because of the timing of the merger closing late in the year its results of operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations for 2013 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our merger with harris teeter 

  

our 2013 performance 

  

we achieved outstanding results in 2013 our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count and good cost control as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share our 2013 net earnings were 15 billion or 290 per diluted share compared to 15 billion or 277 per diluted share for the same period of 2012 the net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million which includes benefits from certain tax items of 40 million offset partially by aftertax expense of 17 million 7 million in interest and 10 million in operating general and administrative expenses in costs related to our merger with harris teeter “2013 adjusted items” see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to the benefits from certain tax items for 2012 our net earnings include an estimated aftertax amount of 58 million or 011 per diluted share due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2012 the “extra week” in addition 2012 net earnings benefited by 74 million aftertax or 014 per diluted share from a settlement with visa and mastercard and from a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january 2012 excluding the 2013 adjusted items net earnings for 2013 totaled 15 billion or 285 per diluted share compared to net earnings in 2012 of 14 billion or 252 per diluted share excluding the visa and mastercard settlement the ufcw consolidated pension fund adjustment and the extra week in 2012 we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share present a more accurate yearoveryear comparison of our financial results because the adjusted items were not directly related to our daytoday business after accounting for these 2013 and 2012 adjusted items our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for 2013 represents a 13 increase compared to 2012 please refer to the “net earnings” section for more information 

  

our identical supermarket sales increased 36 excluding fuel in 2013 compared to 2012 we have achieved 41 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as it is a key performance target for our longterm growth strategy 

  

  

increasing market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen pos data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 50 basis points in 2013 across our 18 marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in 16 of the marketing areas and declined in two walmart supercenters are one of our top two competitors in 13 of these 18 marketing areas in these 13 marketing areas our market share increased in 12 and slightly declined in one these market share results reflect our longterm strategy of market share growth 

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2013 compared to 2012 and for 2012 compared to 2011 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods and an extra week in 2012

net earnings totaled 15 billion in 2013 15 billion in 2012 and 602 million in 2011 the net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of 23 million after tax related to the 2013 adjusted items the net earnings for 2012 include a benefit from net earnings of approximately 58 million aftertax for the extra week and a net 74 million aftertax benefit for the settlement with visa and mastercard and a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january 2012 “2012 adjusted items” the net earnings for 2011 include a ufcw consolidated pension plan charge totaling 591 million aftertax “2011 adjusted item” excluding these benefits and charges for adjusted items in 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted net earnings were 15 billion in 2013 14 billion in 2012 and 12 billion in 2011 2013 adjusted net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2012 due to an increase in firstin firstout “fifo” nonfuel operating profit and decreased interest expense partially offset by increased income tax expense 2012 adjusted net earnings improved compared to adjusted net earnings in 2011 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a lastin firstout “lifo” charge of 55 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 216 million pretax in 2011 partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense 

  

2013 net earnings per diluted share totaled 290 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share totaled 285 which excludes the 2013 adjusted items 2012 net earnings per diluted share totaled 277 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share totaled 252 which excludes the 2012 adjusted items 2011 net earnings per diluted share totaled 101 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 totaled 200 which excludes the 2011 adjusted item adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2013 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2012 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo nonfuel operating profit and decreased interest expense partially offset by increased income tax expense adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2012 compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo nonfuel operating profit increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a decrease in the lifo charge to 55 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 216 million pretax in 2011 partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because the adjusted items referenced above in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are not directly related to our daytoday business adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are nongenerally accepted accounting principle “nongaap” financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of ongoing operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our daytoday operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets in addition management takes into account adjusted net earnings when calculating management incentive programs 

  

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co to net earnings attributable to the kroger co excluding the adjusted items and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share to the net earnings attributable to the kroger co per diluted common share excluding the adjusted items for 2013 2012 and 2011

total sales

total sales increased in 2013 compared to 2012 by 182 the increase in 2013 total sales compared to 2012 was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 36 partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2012 total sales increased in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted total sales by 39 the increase in 2013 total sales compared to 2012 adjusted total sales was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 36 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in average sale per customer partially due to inflation and an increase in the transaction count 

  

total sales increased in 2012 compared to 2011 by 70 the increase in 2012 total sales compared to 2011 was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 35 increased fuel sales of 89 and the extra week in fiscal 2012 adjusted total sales increased in 2012 compared to 2011 by 49 the increase in 2012 adjusted total sales compared to 2011 total sales was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 35 and an increase in fuel sales of 89 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased in 2012 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in the average sale per customer partially due to inflation and an increase in the transaction count total fuel sales increased in 2012 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in fuel gallons sold of 78 and an increase in the average retail fuel price of 17 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2013 compared to the previous year results adjusted to a comparable 52 week period

gross margin and fifo gross margin 

  

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2057 in 2013 2059 in 2012 and 2092 in 2011 the decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales offset partially by a growth rate in retail fuel sales that was lower than the total company sales growth rate our retail fuel operations lower our gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales a lower growth rate in retail fuel sales as compared to the growth rate for the total company increases the gross margin rates as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year the decrease in gross margin rates in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily from a higher growth rate in fuel sales as compared to the growth rate for the total company continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales offset partially by a decrease in the lifo charge as a percentage of sales 

  

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our lifo charge was 52 million in 2013 55 million in 2012 and 216 million in 2011 fifo gross margin is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2062 in 2013 2065 in 2012 and 2115 in 2011 our retail fuel operations lower our fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased 14 basis points in 2013 as a percentage of sales compared to 2012 this decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased 40 basis points in 2012 as a percentage of sales compared to 2011 this decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 52 million in 2013 55 million in 2012 and 216 million in 2011 we experienced relatively consistent levels of product cost inflation in 2013 compared to 2012 in 2013 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to meat seafood and pharmacy in 2012 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery natural foods meat deli and bakery general merchandise and grocery partially offset by deflation in seafood and manufactured product in 2012 we experienced lower levels of product cost inflation compared to 2011 in 2011 our lifo charge primarily resulted from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery meat and seafood deli and bakery and pharmacy 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefits and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1545 in 2013 1537 in 2012 and 1700 in 2011 excluding the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1543 in 2013 1552 in 2012 and 1594 in 2011 our retail fuel operations reduce our overall oga rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2013 adjusted items decreased 17 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 adjusted for the 2012 adjusted items this decrease resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level offset partially by increased incentive compensation oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2012 adjusted items decreased 36 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 adjusted for the 2011 adjusted items this decrease resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements effective cost controls at the store level the benefit received in lower operating expenses from the consolidation of four ufcw multiemployer pension plans in the prior year and decreased incentive compensation offset partially by increased healthcare costs 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 613 million in 2013 as compared to 628 million in 2012 and 619 million in 2011 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 062 in 2013 as compared to 065 in 2012 and 069 in 2011 rent expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased four basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 and four basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 these continual decreases in rent expense as a percentage of sales both including and excluding fuel reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of increased sales 

  

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 17 billion in both 2013 and 2012 and 16 billion in 2011 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 173 in 2013 171 in 2012 and 181 in 2011 excluding the extra week in 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 174 in 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the extra week in 2012 decreased three basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 and seven basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 these continual decreases in depreciation and amortization expense excluding the extra week in 2012 as a percentage of sales both including and excluding fuel are primarily the result of increasing sales offset partially by our increased spending in capital investments 

  

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 27 billion in 2013 28 billion in 2012 and 13 billion in 2011 excluding the extra week operating profit was 27 billion in 2012 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 277 in 2013 286 in 2012 and 142 in 2011 operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week in 2012 was 281 operating profit excluding the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 27 billion in 2013 26 billion in 2012 and 22 billion in 2011 operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 279 in 2013 269 in 2012 and 247 in 2011 

  

operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2013 and 2012 adjusted items increased 10 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent and depreciation as a percentage of sales offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 and 2011 adjusted items increased 22 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent depreciation and the lifo charge as a percentage of sales offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales 

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness since fuel discounts are earned based on instore purchases fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts which are allocated to our instore supermarket location departments we also derive operating general and administrative expenses rent and depreciation and amortization through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit 

  

fifo operating profit was 28 billion in 2013 and 2012 and 15 billion in 2011 excluding the extra week in 2012 fifo operating profit was 27 billion fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 282 in 2013 292 in 2012 and 166 in 2011 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week in 2012 was 287 fifo operating profit excluding the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 28 billion in 2013 26 billion in 2012 and 24 billion in 2011 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 284 in 2013 275 in 2012 and 271 in 2011 

  

retail fuel sales lower our overall fifo operating profit rate due to the very low fifo operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit excluding fuel was 26 billion in 2013 and 2012 and 13 billion in 2011 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit excluding fuel was 25 billion in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 322 in 2013 335 in 2012 and 177 in 2011 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 328 in 2012 fifo operating profit excluding fuel and the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 26 billion in 2013 24 billion in 2012 and 23 billion in 2011 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2013 2012 and 2011 adjusted items was 324 in 2013 313 in 2012 and 307 in 2011 

  

  

excluding fuel fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2013 and 2012 adjusted items increased 11 basis points in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improvements in oga expenses rent and depreciation as a percentage of sales offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and advertising costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 and 2011 adjusted items increased six basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent and depreciation as a percentage of sales offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to fifo operating profit and fifo operating profit excluding fuel and the adjusted items for 2013 2012 and 2011  in millions 

  

   

   

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 443 million in 2013 462 million in 2012 and 435 million in 2011 excluding the extra week net interest expense was 454 million in 2012 the decrease in net interest expense in 2013 compared to 2012 excluding the extra week resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate offset partially by a decrease in the net benefit from interest rate swaps the increase in net interest expense in 2012 excluding the extra week compared to 2011 resulted primarily from a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps and an increase in total debt offset partially by a lower weighted average interest rate 

  

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 329 in 2013 345 in 2012 and 293 in 2011 the 2013 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2012 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2013 benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction increased from 2012 due to additional deductions taken in 2013 as well as the amendment of prior years’ tax returns to claim the additional benefit available in years still under review by the internal revenue service the 2011 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits and the favorable resolution of certain tax issues partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2011 effective tax rate was also lower than 2013 and 2012 due to the effect on pretax income of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge of 953 million 591 million aftertax excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge our effective rate in 2011 would have been 339 

  

common share repurchase program 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger common shares totaling 338 million in 2013 12 billion in 2012 and 14 billion in 2011 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 271 million in 2013 96 million in 2012 and 127 million in 2011 of kroger shares under the stock option program 

  

the shares reacquired in 2013 were acquired under two separate share repurchase programs the first is a 500 million repurchase program that was authorized by kroger’s board of directors on october 16 2012 the second is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in kroger’s stock option and longterm incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits as of february 1 2014 we had 129 million remaining on the october 16 2012 500 million share repurchase program   on march 13 2014 the company announced a new 1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by the board of directors replacing the 500 million repurchase program that was authorized by the board of directors on october 16 2012 

  

capital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 23 billion in 2013 20 billion in 2012 and 19 billion in 2011 capital investments for acquisitions totaled 23 billion in 2013 122 million in 2012 and 51 million in 2011 capital investments for acquisitions of 23 billion in 2013 relate to our merger with harris teeter refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the merger with harris teeter capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 108 million in 2013 73 million in 2012 and 60 million in 2011 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

  

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts harris teeter’s invested capital has been excluded from the calculation in 2013 due to the timing of the merger and the immaterial effect on operations as compared to the average invested capital roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures excluding certain adjustments to operating income 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

  

  

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2013 and 2012 on a 52 week basis and excluding the assets and liabilities recorded at year end for harris teeter  in millions 

  

   

1   taxes receivable were 18 as of february 1 2014 2 as of february 2 2013 and 42 as of january 28 2012 

2   other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 92 as of february 1 2014 and 128 as of february 2 2013 as of january 28 2012 other current liabilities did not include any accrued income taxes accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

3   harris teeter’s invested capital has been excluded from the calculation due to the timing of the merger and the immaterial effect on the operations as compared to the average invested capital 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february 1 2014 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 2 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 39 million in 2013 18 million in 2012 and 37 million in 2011 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 21 billion as of february 1 2014 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

in 2013 goodwill increased 901 million due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january 28 2014 for additional information related to the allocation of the harris teeter purchase price refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2013 2012 and 2011 did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2013 2012 and 2011 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 15 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of yearend 2013 and 2012 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 499 and 468 discount rates as of yearend 2013 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 429 and 411 as of yearend 2012 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 1 2014 by approximately 395 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for 2013 we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories due to the harris teeter merger occurring close to year end the expected rate of return on pension plan assets acquired in the harris teeter merger did not affect our net periodic benefit cost in 2013 for 2013 and 2012 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average rate of return was 81 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2013 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans excluding pension plan assets acquired in the harris teeter merger during the calendar year ending december 31 2013 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 80 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 92 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an 85 rate of return assumption was reasonable for 2013 and 2012 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 100 million in 2013 71 million in 2012 and 52 million in 2011 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans we do not expect to make any contributions to companysponsored defined benefit pension plans in 2014 among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions 

  

we contributed and expensed 148 million in 2013 140 million in 2012 and 130 million in 2011 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

  

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” with 14 locals of the ufcw that participated in four multiemployer pension funds the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multiemployer pension funds into one multiemployer pension fund 

  

under the terms of the mou the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through 2021 we are designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated pension plan with sole investment authority over the assets we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the preconsolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability “uaal” that existed as of december 31 2011 in a series of installments on or before march 31 2018 at january 1 2012 the uaal was estimated to be 911 million pretax in accordance with gaap we expensed 911 million in 2011 related to the uaal the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment in 2012 we finalized the uaal contractual commitment and recorded an adjustment that reduced our 2011 estimated commitment by 53 million pretax the final uaal contractual commitment at january 1 2012 was 858 million pretax in the fourth quarter of 2011 we contributed 650 million to the consolidated multiemployer pension plan of which 600 million was allocated to the uaal and 50 million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we contributed 258 million to the consolidated multiemployer pension plan to fully fund our uaal contractual commitment future contributions will be dependent among other things on the investment performance of assets in the plan the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 228 million in 2013 492 million in 2012 and 946 million in 2011 the cash contributions for 2012 and 2011 include our 258 million contribution in 2012 and our 650 million contribution in 2011 to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of each year 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2013 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above as of december 31 2013 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 16 billion pretax or 10 billion aftertax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 150 million pretax or 95 million aftertax as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the increased returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans during 2013 our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2013 excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan our contributions to these plans increased approximately 5 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 8 since 2008 in 2014 we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on current market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation the company continues to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any commitments to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of february 1 2014 the internal revenue service had concluded its field examination of our 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns we have filed an administrative appeal with the internal revenue service protesting certain adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service as a result of their field work 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 95 of inventories in 2013 and 96 of inventories in 2012 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 12 billion at february 1 2014 and by 11 billion at february 2 2013 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 62 billion in 2013 and 2012 and 59 billion in 2011 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 94 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in february 2013 the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income in which the item was reclassified if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it requires cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period this new disclosure became effective for us beginning february 3 2013 and is being adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard see note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for the company’s new disclosures related to this amended standard 

  

in december 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement this information is intended to enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on our financial position the new rules became effective for us on february 3 2013 in january 2013 the fasb further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements securities borrowings and lending transactions see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for the company’s new disclosures related to this amended standard 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in july 2013 the fasb amended accounting standards codification “asc” 740 “income taxes” the amendments provide guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either a reduction of a deferred tax asset or as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists the amendments will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 and may be applied on a retrospective basis early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 34 billion of cash from operations in 2013 compared to 28 billion in 2012 and 27 billion in 2011 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization the lifo charge and changes in working capital the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily due to changes in working capital and longterm liabilities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests offset by a decline in longterm liabilities and changes in working capital 

  

  

the use of cash for the payment of longterm liabilities decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to our funding of the remaining uaal in 2012 the use of cash increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to our funding of the remaining uaal commitment changes in working capital used cash from operating activities of 130 million in 2013 compared to 332 million in 2012 and 300 million in 2011 the decreased use of cash for changes in working capital in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in deposits intransit and a reduced use of cash for prepaid expenses and receivables the increased use of cash for changes in working capital in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to an increased use of cash for prepaid expenses and less cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by a reduced use of cash for inventories cash used for prepaid expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to kroger prefunding 250 million of employee benefits at the end of 2012 these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 100 million in 2013 71 million in 2012 and 52 million in 2011 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to additional deductions taken in 2012 related to the funding of our pension contributions and union health benefits the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 48 billion in 2013 compared to 22 billion in 2012 and 19 billion in 2011 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased payments for capital investments and acquisitions the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased payments for capital investments and acquisitions capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 24 billion in 2013 21 billion in 2012 and 20 billion in 2011 acquisitions were 23 billion in 2013 122 million in 2012 and 51 million in 2011 the increase in payments for acquisitions in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to our merger with harris teeter refer to the “capital investments” section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities provided used cash of 16 billion in 2013 600 million in 2012 and 14 billion in 2011 the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily related to increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt primarily to finance our merger with harris teeter and a reduction in payments on longterm debt and treasury stock purchases offset partially by net payments on our commercial paper program the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily related to increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and net borrowings from our commercial paper program offset partially by payments on longterm debt proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt were 35 billion in 2013 863 million in 2012 and 453 million in 2011 proceeds payments provided from our commercial paper program were 395 million in 2013 13 billion in 2012 and 370 million in 2011 please refer to the “debt management” section for additional information we repurchased 609 million of kroger common shares in 2013 compared to 13 billion in 2012 and 15 billion in 2011 we paid dividends totaling 319 million in 2013 267 million in 2012 and 257 million in 2011 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital lease and leasefinancing obligations increased 24 billion to 113 billion as of yearend 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted from the issuance of i 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 385 ii 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 515 iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3month london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 53 basis points iv 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 12 v 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 23 vi 700 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 33 and vii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 40 offset partially by a reduction in commercial paper of 395 million and payments at maturity of 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 and 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 75 this increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with harris teeter refinancing our debt maturities in 2013 and replacing the senior notes that matured in fourth quarter of 2012 offset partially by the payment at maturity of our 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 75 and a reduction in commercial paper of 395 million 

  

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations increased 714 million to 89 billion as of yearend 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted from increased borrowings of 13 billion of commercial paper supported by our credit facility and the issuance of i 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 34 and ii 350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 offset partially by payments at maturity of i 491 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 675 ii 346 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 62 and iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 this increase in financing obligations was primarily to fund our 258 million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter of 2012 prefunding 250 million of employee benefit costs at the end of 2012 to repurchase common shares pay at maturity 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 and purchase of a specialty pharmacy 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to be approximately 45 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2013 based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 12 billion of commercial paper and 300 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the 45 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in 2014 by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the company’s share repurchase programs we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities during 2014 but do not currently expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 2 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at february 1 2014 we had 12 billion of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march 28 2014 we had 665 million of cp borrowings outstanding the decrease as of march 28 2014 compared to yearend 2013 was due to applying cash from operations against our yearend cp outstanding borrowings 

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 230 to 1 as of february 1 2014 if this ratio were to exceed 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio 

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 483 to 1 as of february 1 2014 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 

  

our credit agreement is more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2013 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 1 2014 in millions of dollars 

  

   

1   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 125 million in 2013 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 228 million in 2013 

2   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 

3   as of february 1 2014 we had 12 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines 

4   amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february 1 2014 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments 

5   the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability related to workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis 

  

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments many of which are shortterm in nature to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of february 1 2014 we maintained a 2 billion with the ability to increase by 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on january 25 2017 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintain two uncommitted money market lines totaling 75 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of february 1 2014 we had 12 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 12 million as of february 1 2014 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 1 2014 we had authorized for issuance 25 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 13 2013 

  

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

  

outlook 

  

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance including harris teeter these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

·   we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of 314325 for fiscal year 2014

·   for 2014 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 350 excluding the unexpected effect of the resolution of any tax issues and benefits from certain tax items 

  

·   we do not anticipate goodwill impairments in 2014 

  

·   for 2014 we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to multiemployer pension funds we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any commitments to fund certain multiemployer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made 

  

·   in 2014 we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in cincinnati atlanta southern california new mexico richmondhampton roads west virginia and arizona and an agreement with the teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities these negotiations will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care also we must address the underfunding of multiemployer pension plans 

  

  

various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these include 

  

·   the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets 

  

·   our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares pay dividends and fund capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings 

  

·   our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending changes in governmentfunded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases the effect of brand prescription drugs going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including inflation or deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above 

  

·   during the first three quarters of our fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by estimated yearend changes in product costs our lifo charge for the fiscal year will be affected primarily by changes in product costs at yearend 

  

·   if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units’ goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized 

  

·   our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 

  

·   the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our 401k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of participants 

  

·   changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 

  

we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger’s business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2014 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives we undertake no obligation to update the forwardlooking information contained in this filing 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 1 2014 we maintained 2 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 100 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature in december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of february 1 2014 other longterm liabilities totaling 2 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements primarily offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  

as of february 1 2014 we maintained no forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt periodically we will enter into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our future forecasted issuances of debt 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 refer to notes 6 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

   

   

   

based on our yearend 2013 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

 item 1   business 

  

the kroger co the “company” was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of february 2 2013 the company was one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales the company also manufactures and processes some of the food for sale in its supermarkets the company’s principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and its telephone number is 513 7624000 the company maintains a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company the company makes available through its web site free of charge its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q its current reports on form 8k and its interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the company has filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

the company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its stores the company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to its customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses the company’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 

  

employees 

  

as of february 2 2013 the company employed approximately 343000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 300 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

during 2013 the company will negotiate major labor contracts covering store employees in indianapolis houston dallas cincinnati and seattle among others these negotiations will be challenging as the company seeks competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care in these negotiations we will also need to address the underfunding of our multiemployer pension plans 

  

stores 

  

as of february 2 2013 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2424 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 1169 of which had fuel centers approximately 45 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of february 2 2013 the company operated through subsidiaries 786 convenience stores and 328 fine jewelry stores all of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 81 convenience stores were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements approximately 53 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline 

  

segments 

  

the company operates retail food and drug stores multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states the company’s retail operations which represent over 99 of the company’s consolidated sales and ebitda are its only reportable segment the company’s retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition the company’s operating divisions offer to its customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the company’s merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location the company’s operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how the company’s chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as the company’s chief operating decision makers assess performance internally all of the company’s operations are domestic revenues profit and losses and total assets are shown in the company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in the company’s merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately 12000 private label items the company’s corporate brand products are produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the company’s private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it kroger value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price in addition the company recently introduced two corporate brand lines simple truth and simple truth organic both brands are free from 101 artificial preservatives and ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food and the simple truth organic products are usda certified organic 

  

approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold are produced in the company’s manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to the company’s strict specifications by outside manufacturers the company performs a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of february 2 2013 the company operated 37 manufacturing plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies nine deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants two beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants

for the disclosure related to the company’s competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

product safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise concerns regarding the safety of the products that kroger sells could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2013 covering store employees in indianapolis houston dallas cincinnati and seattle among others upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations 

  

strategy execution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experiences through improved service product selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or with the permission of the individual although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate or a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

indebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2013 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 89 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and we expect that the company’s contributions to those funds excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan will increase over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would affect kroger’s cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate in addition we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we could be responsible for the shortfall 

  

  

insurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

current economic conditions 

  

the global economy and financial markets have experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices availability of credit difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors the decline in the housing market diminished market liquidity low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates as a result consumers have been more cautious consumers have reduced spending and have switched to less expensive mixes of products they also have been patronizing discounters and dollar stores for grocery items to a greater extent all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings increased fuel prices could have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities interrupt the delivery of products to our stores substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 2   properties 

  

as of february 2 2013 the company operated more than 3600 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and manufacturing plants through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while the company’s current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct the company’s business are leased 

  

the company generally owns store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and manufacturing equipment the total cost of the company’s owned assets and capitalized leases at february 2 2013 was 294 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 145 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after the conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution manufacturing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc v commissioner of internal revenue docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies asserted by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involved a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition therefore did not qualify for a section 338h10 election on january 27 2011 the tax court issued its opinion upholding the company’s position that the acquisition of the stock qualified as a purchase granting the company’s motion for partial summary judgment and denying the tax commissioner’s motion all remaining issues in the matter had been resolved and the tax court entered its decision on may 2 2012 on july 24 2012 the tax commissioner filed a notice with the united states court of appeals for the 9 th circuit to appeal the decision of the tax court 

  

subsequent to the filing of the notice to appeal the government requested the dismissal of the case on november 14 2012 the united states court of appeals for the 9 th circuit issued its dismissal order with prejudice finally resolving all issues in the matter 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material to the company it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2424 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons jay c food 4 less fred meyer fry’s king soopers qfc ralphs and smith’s of these stores 1169 have fuel centers we also operate 786 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees and 328 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 37 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 99 of kroger’s consolidated sales and ebitda are our only reportable segment 

  

our 2012 performance 

  

we achieved outstanding results in 2012 our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count and good cost control as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share our 2012 net earnings were 15 billion or 277 per diluted share compared to 602 million or 101 per diluted share for the same period of 2011 for 2012 this includes estimated net earnings of 91 million pretax 58 million aftertax or 011 per diluted share due to a 53 rd week in fiscal year 2012 the “extra week” in addition net earnings benefited by 115 million pretax 74 million aftertax or 014 per diluted share from a settlement with visa and mastercard and from a reduction in our obligation to fund the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” consolidated pension fund created in january 2012 excluding the visa and mastercard settlement the ufcw consolidated pension fund adjustment and the extra week in 2012 our adjusted net earnings were 14 billion or 252 per diluted share our 2011 results included a charge related to the consolidation of four multiemployer pension plans to the ufcw consolidated pension plan totaling 953 million pretax 591 million aftertax excluding the 2011 adjusted item our 2011 adjusted net earnings were 12 billion or 200 per diluted share after accounting for these adjusted items our 2012 adjusted net earnings per diluted share represent a 26 increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share please refer to the “net earnings” section for more information related to the increase in net earnings for 2012 compared to 2011 

  

our identical supermarket sales increased by 35 excluding fuel in 2012 we have achieved 37 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel because our business model emphasizes this primary component 

  

increasing market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 20 basis points in 2012 across our 19 marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in 10 of the marketing areas and declined in nine walmart supercenters are a primary competitor in 17 of these 19 marketing areas in these 17 marketing areas our market share increased in nine and declined in eight nielsen homescan data is generated by customers who selfreport their grocery purchases to nielsen regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet these market share results reflect our longterm strategy of market share growth 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2012 compared to 2011 and for 2011 compared to 2010 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods and an extra week in 2012 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 15 billion in 2012 602 million in 2011 and 11 billion in 2010 the net earnings for 2012 include benefits from net earnings of approximately 58 million aftertax for the extra week a 74 million aftertax settlement with visa and mastercard and a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january 2012 “2012 adjusted items” the net earnings for 2011 include a ufcw consolidated pension plan charge totaling 591 million aftertax “2011 adjusted item” the net earnings for 2010 include a noncash goodwill impairment charge totaling 12 million aftertax related to a small number of stores “2010 adjusted item” excluding these benefits and charges for adjusted items in 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted net earnings were 14 billion in 2012 12 billion in 2011 and 11 billion in 2010 2012 adjusted net earnings improved compared to 2011 due to an increase in firstin firstout “fifo” nonfuel operating profit increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a lastin firstout “lifo” charge of 55 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 216 million pretax in 2011 partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense 2011 adjusted net earnings improved compared to 2010 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by a lifo charge of 216 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 57 million pretax in 2010 

  

2012 net earnings per diluted share totaled 277 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2012 totaled 252 which excludes the 2012 adjusted items 2011 net earnings per diluted share totaled 101 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 totaled 200 which excludes the 2011 adjusted item 2010 net earnings per diluted share totaled 174 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 totaled 176 which excludes the 2010 adjusted item adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2012 compared to 2011 increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo nonfuel operating profit increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a decrease in the lifo charge to 55 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 216 million pretax in 2011 partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 compared to 2010 increased primarily due to increased retail fuel margins the repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo nonfuel operating profit and the favorable resolution of certain tax issues offset by a lifo charge of 216 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 57 million pretax in 2010 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because the amounts referenced above in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are not directly related to our daytoday business adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are nongenerally accepted accounting principle “nongaap” financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of ongoing operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our daytoday operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets in addition management takes into account adjusted net earnings when calculating management incentive programs 

  

  

sales 

  

total sales 

 in millions 

  

   

1   other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores excluding fuel jewelry stores manufacturing plants to outside customers variable interest entities a specialty pharmacy and instore health clinics 

2   the 2012 adjusted column represents the items presented in the 2012 column adjusted to remove the extra week 

3   this column represents the percentage increase in 2012 adjusted sales compared to 2011 

4   this column represents the percentage increase in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

the increase in 2012 adjusted total sales compared to 2011 total sales was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 35 and an increase in fuel sales of 89 the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2012 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2011 was due to our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 35 total fuel sales increased in 2012 adjusted for the extra week compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in fuel gallons sold of 78 and an increase in the average retail fuel price of 17 the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to inflation increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip also primarily due to inflation 

  

the increase in total sales for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 49 and an increase in fuel sales of 399 total fuel sales increased over the same period due to a 263 increase in average retail fuel prices and a 108 increase in fuel gallons sold the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 49 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to inflation increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip also primarily due to inflation 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 53week period of 2012 compared to the previous year results adjusted to a comparable 53 week period 

  

identical supermarket sales 

 dollars in millions 

  

   

1   identical supermarket sales for 2011 were adjusted to a comparable 53 week basis by including week 1 of fiscal 2012 in our 2011 identical supermarket sales base however for purposes of determining the percentage change in identical supermarket sales from 2010 to 2011 2011 identical supermarket sales were not adjusted to include the sales from week 1 of 2012 

  

  

gross margin and fifo gross margin 

  

our gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2056 in 2012 2089 in 2011 and 2224 in 2010 the decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily from increased fuel sales continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs offset partially by a decrease in the lifo charge as a percentage of sales the decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from increased fuel sales continued investments in lower prices for our customers higher transportation costs and an increase in the lifo charge offset partially by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales retail fuel sales lower our gross margin rate due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales 

  

we calculate fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our lifo charge was 55 million in 2012 216 million in 2011 and 57 million in 2010 fifo gross margin is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2062 in 2012 2113 in 2011 and 2231 in 2010 retail fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased 41 basis points in 2012 as a percentage of sales compared to 2011 this decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased 33 basis points in 2011 as a percentage of sales compared to 2010 this decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to continued investments in lower prices for our customers the effect of inflation and higher transportation expenses partially offset by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 55 million in 2012 216 million in 2011 and 57 million in 2010 like many food retailers we experienced lower levels of product cost inflation in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2012 our lifo charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery natural foods meat deli and bakery general merchandise and pharmacy partially offset by deflation in seafood and manufactured product in 2011 we experienced higher levels of product cost inflation compared to 2010 in 2011 our lifo charge primarily resulted from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery meat and seafood deli and bakery and pharmacy in 2010 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to meat pharmacy and companymanufactured products partially offset by deflation in grocery products 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefits and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1535 in 2012 1698 in 2011 and 1685 in 2010 excluding the 2012 and 2011 adjusted items oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1547 in 2012 and 1592 in 2011 the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2012 adjusted items decreased 39 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 this decrease resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements effective cost controls at the store level the benefit received in lower operating expenses from the consolidation of four ufcw multiemployer pension plans in the prior year and decreased incentive compensation offset partially by increased healthcare costs oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2011 adjusted item decreased 25 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 the 2011 decrease compared to 2010 resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and strong cost controls at the store level offset partially by increased credit and debit card fees incentive compensation and health care costs 

  

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 628 million in 2012 as compared to 619 million in 2011 and 623 million in 2010 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 065 in 2012 as compared to 068 in 2011 and 076 in 2010 rent expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 078 in 2012 as compared to 082 in 2011 and 087 in 2010 these continual decreases in rent expense as a percentage of sales both including and excluding fuel reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of increased supermarket sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 17 billion in 2012 and 16 billion in both 2011 and 2010 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 171 in 2012 181 in 2011 and 195 in 2010 excluding the extra week in 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 174 in 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 199 in 2012 210 in 2011 and 217 in 2010 excluding the extra week in 2012 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 203 these continual decreases in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales both including and excluding fuel and the extra week are primarily the result of increasing sales 

  

operating profit and fifo operating profit 

  

operating profit was 28 billion in 2012 13 billion in 2011 and 22 billion in 2010 excluding the extra week operating profit was 27 billion in 2012 operating profit as a percentage of sales was 286 in 2012 141 in 2011 and 266 in 2010 operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week was 281 operating profit excluding the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 26 billion in 2012 and 22 billion in both 2011 and 2010 operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 274 in 2012 247 in 2011 and 268 in 2010 operating profit excluding the extra week and the 2012 adjusted items was 25 billion in 2012 operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week and the 2012 adjusted items was 269 in 2012 

  

operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 and 2011 adjusted items and the extra week increased 22 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent depreciation and the lifo charge offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2011 and 2010 adjusted items decreased 21 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the lifo charge continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher transportation costs offset partially by improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent depreciation advertising shrink and warehousing costs 

  

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge fifo operating profit is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our daytoday operational effectiveness since fuel discounts are earned based on instore purchases fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts which are allocated to our instore supermarket location departments we also derive operating general and administrative expenses rent and depreciation and amortization through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit 

  

fifo operating profit was 28 billion in 2012 15 billion in 2011 and 22 billion in 2010 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit was 27 billion in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales was 291 in 2012 165 in 2011 and 273 in 2010 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week was 287 in 2012 fifo operating profit excluding the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 27 billion in 2012 24 billion in 2011 and 23 billion in 2010 fifo operating profit excluding the extra week and the 2012 adjusted items was 28 billion in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 279 in 2012 271 in 2011 and 275 in 2010 fifo operating profit excluding the extra week and the 2012 adjusted items was 275 in 2012 

  

  

retail fuel sales lower our overall fifo operating profit rate due to the very low fifo operating profit rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to nonfuel sales fifo operating profit excluding fuel was 26 billion in 2012 13 billion in 2011 and 21 billion in 2010 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit excluding fuel was 25 billion in 2012 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 334 in 2012 177 in 2011 and 300 in 2010 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel was 328 in 2012 fifo operating profit excluding fuel and the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 25 billion in 2012 23 billion in 2011 and 21 billion in 2010 fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2012 2011 and 2010 adjusted items was 319 in 2012 307 in 2011 and 302 in 2010 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit excluding fuel and the 2012 adjusted items was 24 billion in 2012 excluding the extra week fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the 2012 adjusted items was 313 in 2012 

  

excluding fuel fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2012 and 2011 adjusted items and the extra week increased six basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent and depreciation offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink and warehousing costs excluding fuel fifo operating profit as a percentage of sales excluding the 2011 and 2010 adjusted items increased five basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to improvements in operating general and administrative expenses rent depreciation advertising shrink and warehousing costs offset partially by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher transportation costs 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to fifo operating profit and fifo operating profit excluding fuel and the adjusted items for 2012 2011 and 2010  in millions

percentages may not sum due to rounding 

  

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 462 million in 2012 435 million in 2011 and 448 million in 2010 excluding the extra week net interest expense was 454 million in 2012 the increase in net interest expense in 2012 excluding the extra week compared to 2011 resulted primarily from a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps and an increase in total debt offset partially by a lower weighted average interest rate the decrease in net interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate and an average lower debt balance for the year offset partially by a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 345 in 2012 293 in 2011 and 347 in 2010 the 2012 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits and favorable resolution of certain tax issues partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2011 effective tax rate was also lower than 2012 and 2010 due to the effect on pretax income of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge of 953 million 591 million aftertax excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge our effective rate in 2011 would have been 339 

  

common share repurchase program 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger common shares totaling 12 billion in 2012 14 billion in 2011 and 505 million in 2010 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 96 million in 2012 127 million in 2011 and 40 million in 2010 of kroger shares under the stock option program 

  

the shares reacquired in 2012 were reacquired under four separate share repurchase programs the first is a 1 billion repurchase program that was authorized by kroger’s board of directors on september 15 2011 the second is a 1 billion repurchase program that was authorized by kroger’s board of directors on june 14 2012 that replaced the first referenced program the third is a 500 million repurchase program that was authorized by kroger’s board of directors on october 16 2012 that replaced the second referenced program the fourth is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in kroger’s stock option and longterm incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits as of february 2 2013 we had 466 million remaining on the october 16 2012 500 million share repurchase program 

  

capital investments 

  

capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 20 billion in 2012 and 19 billion in both 2011 and 2010 capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 73 million in 2012 60 million in 2011 and 38 million for 2010 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage

return on invested capital 

  

we calculate return on invested capital “roic” by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts roic is a nongaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures excluding certain adjustments to operating income 

  

although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 

  

  

the following table provides a calculation of roic for 2012 and 2011 on a 52 week basis  in millions 

  

   

1   taxes receivable were 2 as of february 2 2013 and 42 as of january 28 2012 as of january 29 2011 the company did not have any taxes receivable 

2   other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of 128 as of february 2 2013 and 61 as of january 29 2011 as of january 28 2012 other current liabilities did not include any accrued income taxes accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february 2 2013 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 2 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 18 million in 2012 37 million in 2011 and 25 million in 2010 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 12 billion as of february 2 2013 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 did not result in impairment 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in an impairment charge of 18 million based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010 a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 18 million 12 million aftertax in 2009 we disclosed that a 10 reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this reporting unit 

  

based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2012 2011 and 2010 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our policy for selecting the discount rates as of yearend 2012 changed from the policy as of yearend 2011 and 2010 in 2012 our policy was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 429 and 411 discount rates as of yearend 2012 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant in 2011 and 2010 our policy was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be “settled” by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 455 and 440 discount rates as of yearend 2011 for pension and other benefits respectively represents the equivalent single rates constructed under a broadmarket aa yield curve constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 2 2013 by approximately 412 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories for 2012 and 2011 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average rate of return was 97 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2012 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2012 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 150 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 99 the average annual return for the sp 500 over the same period of time has been 85 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an 85 rate of return assumption is reasonable see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 71 million in 2012 52 million in 2011 and 141 million in 2010 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans in february 2013 we contributed 100 million to the companysponsored defined benefit pension plans and do not expect to make any additional contributions in 2013 we expect contributions made during 2013 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions 

  

  

we contributed and expensed 140 million in 2012 130 million in 2011 and 119 million in 2010 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” with 14 locals of the ufcw that participated in four multiemployer pension funds the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multiemployer pension funds into one multiemployer pension fund 

  

under the terms of the mou the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through 2021 we are designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated pension plan with sole investment authority over the assets we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the preconsolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability “uaal” that existed as of december 31 2011 in a series of installments on or before march 31 2018 at january 1 2012 the uaal was estimated to be 911 million pretax in accordance with gaap we expensed 911 million in 2011 related to the uaal the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment in 2012 we finalized the uaal contractual commitment and recorded an adjustment that reduced our 2011 estimated commitment by 53 million pretax the final uaal contractual commitment at january 1 2012 was 858 million pretax in the fourth quarter of 2011 we contributed 650 million to the consolidated multiemployer pension plan of which 600 million was allocated to the uaal and 50 million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we contributed 258 million to the consolidated multiemployer pension plan to fully fund our uaal contractual commitment future contributions will be dependent among other things on the investment performance of assets in the plan the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 492 million in 2012 946 million in 2011 and 262 million in 2010 the cash contributions for 2012 and 2011 include our 258 million contribution in 2012 and our 650 million contribution in 2011 to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of each year 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2012 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above as of december 31 2012 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 18 billion pretax or 11 billion aftertax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 471 million pretax or 295 million aftertax as of december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to our contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in 2012 and the increased returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans during 2012 our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2012 excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan our contributions to these plans increased approximately 5 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 7 since 2007 in 2013 we expect to contribute approximately 225 million to our multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions this amount reflects a contribution decrease compared to 2012 due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on current market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of february 2 2013 the internal revenue service had concluded its field examination of our 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns we have filed an administrative appeal within the internal revenue service protesting certain adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service as a result of their field work 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 96 of inventories in 2012 and 97 of inventories in 2011 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 11 billion at february 2 2013 and by 10 billion at january 28 2012 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory when compared to the retail method of accounting in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 62 billion in 2012 59 billion in 2011 and 64 billion in 2010 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately 95 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all nonowner changes in shareholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new rules became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 in december 2011 the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the december 15 2011 effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments we adopted these amended standards effective january 29 2012 by presenting separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income immediately following the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in may 2011 the fasb amended its rules for disclosure requirements for common fair value measurement these amendments effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 early adoption was prohibited result in a common definition of fair value and common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosure between gaap and international financial accounting standards consequently the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

as discussed above under recently adopted accounting standards in december 2011 the fasb deferred certain provisions of its 2011 rule amendments dealing with reclassification adjustments in february 2013 the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component specifically the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period the new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning february 3 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 28 billion of cash from operations in 2012 compared to 27 billion in 2011 and 34 billion in 2010 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization the lifo charge and changes in working capital the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests offset by a decline in longterm liabilities and changes in working capital the decline in longterm liabilities in 2012 is due to the investment returns of our companysponsored pension plans during the year and our funding of the remaining uaal commitment partially offset by a lower discount rate on our companysponsored pension plans the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the decline in net earnings including noncontrolling interests due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge and changes in working capital offset by an increase in longterm liabilities the increase in longterm liabilities in 2011 was due to establishing a liability for our remaining estimated commitment for the uaal in excess of the cash contribution and a lower discount rate on our companysponsored pension plans offset by the investment returns of our companysponsored pension plans during the year changes in working capital also provided used cash from operating activities of 332 million in 2012 compared to 300 million in 2011 and 698 million in 2010 the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses offset partially by an increase in accrued expenses prepaid expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to kroger prefunding 250 million of employee benefits at the end of 2012 the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in inventories offset partially by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 71 million in 2012 52 million in 2011 and 141 million in 2010 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in net earnings including noncontrolling interests the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and from the bonus depreciation deductions allowed by the 2010 tax relief act for property placed into service in 2011 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 22 billion in 2012 compared to 19 billion in 2011 and 20 billion in 2010 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased payments for capital investments and acquisitions the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreased payments for other investing activities offset partially by increased payments for acquisitions capital investments including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 21 billion in 2012 20 billion in 2011 and 19 billion in 2010 refer to the capital investment section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 600 million of cash in 2012 compared to 14 billion in 2011 and 10 billion in 2010 the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily related to increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and net borrowings from our commercial paper program offset partially by payments on longterm debt the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily related to increased payments for treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased borrowings under our commercial paper program we repurchased 13 billion of kroger common shares in 2012 compared to 15 billion in 2011 and 545 million in 2010 we paid dividends totaling 267 million in 2012 257 million in 2011 and 250 million in 2010 

  

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations increased 714 million to 89 billion as of yearend 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted from increased borrowings of 13 billion of commercial paper supported by our credit facility and the issuance of i 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 34 and ii 350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 50 offset partially by payments at maturity of i 491 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 675 ii 346 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 62 and iii 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 this increase was primarily due to our 258 million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter of 2012 prefunding 250 million of employee benefit costs at the end of 2012 our common share repurchase activity during the year the payment at maturity of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 and the purchase of a specialty pharmacy total debt increased 273 million to 82 billion as of yearend 2011 compared to yearend 2010 the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted from increased net borrowings of commercial paper of 370 million and the issuance of 450 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 220 offset by the payment at maturity of our 478 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 680 

  

in 2013 we expect to refinance 15 billion of debt we plan on refinancing our debt maturities in 2013 along with an additional issuance of approximately 500 million to replace the senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 that matured in the fourth quarter of 2012 the debt that matured in the fourth quarter of 2012 was previously refinanced with commercial paper we have entered into 850 million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively hedge the changes in future benchmark interest rates on a portion of our expected issuances of fixed rate debt 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelvemonth period to be approximately 5 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2012 based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 16 billion of commercial paper and 10 billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the 5 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience 20 billion of this debt matures in the first quarter of 2013 in the first quarter of 2013 we anticipate refinancing this 20 billion through cash flows from operating activities and by issuing 10 billion to 12 billion of additional senior notes we also currently do not expect to repurchase our common shares at the levels we did in 2012 we used our commercial paper program toward the end of 2012 to fund our common share repurchases a 250 million pretax prefunding of employee benefit costs at the end of 2012 a 258 million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the payment at maturity of 500 of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 55 we also expect our contributions to the ufcw consolidated pension plan to decrease in future periods we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities at the end of 2013 but do not currently expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 2 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at february 2 2013 we had 16 billion of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march 29 2013 we had 11 billion of cp borrowings outstanding the decrease as of march 29 2013 compared to yearend 2012 was due to applying cash from operations against our yearend cp outstanding borrowings 

  

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 181 to 1 as of february 2 2013 if this ratio were to exceed 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio 

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 467 to 1 as of february 2 2013 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 

  

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our ufcw consolidated pension plan liability adjustment in 2012 our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2012 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 2 2013 in millions of dollars 

  

   

1   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 98 million in 2012 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 492 million in 2012 including our 258 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan 

2   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 

3   as of february 2 2013 we had 16 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines 

4   amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february 2 2013 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments 

5   the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability related to workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis 

  

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of february 2 2013 we maintained a 2 billion with the ability to increase by 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on january 25 2017 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained two uncommitted money market lines totaling 75 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of february 2 2013 we had 16 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 13 million as of february 2 2013 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 2 2013 we had authorized for issuance 700 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 15 2010 on january 18 2013 the board of directors authorized for issuance additional securities in the amount of 18 billion over and above the 700 million of securities available for issuance as of february 2 2013 subsequent to yearend we filed a current report on form 8k on february 11 2013 incorporating by reference additional exhibits to the shelf registration statement including the board of directors’ resolution 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 6 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february 2 2013 we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

  

outlook 

  

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flows projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

   

  

   

  

   

various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include 

  

   

  

   

  

   

we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger’s business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2013 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 2 2013 we maintained 6 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 475 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between april 2013 and december 2018 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of february 2 2013 other longterm assets totaling 1 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  

as of february 2 2013 we maintained 17 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between april 2013 and january 2014 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 850 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year 2013 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 200 to 305 the variable rate component of the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of february 2 2013 the fair value of the interest rates swaps was recorded in other investments for 5 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for 3 million net of tax 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

   

   

   

based on our yearend 2012 variable rate debt levels a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

 item 1   business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 28 2012 the company was one of the largest retailers in the united states based on annual sales the company also manufactures and processes some of the food for sale in its supermarkets the company’s principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and its telephone number is 513 7624000 the company maintains a web site wwwthekrogercocom that includes additional information about the company the company makes available through its web site free of charge its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q its current reports on form 8k and its interactive data files including amendments these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the company has filed them with or furnished them electronically to the sec 

  

the company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its stores the company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to its customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses the company’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 

  

employees 

  

as of january 28 2012 the company employed approximately 339000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 300 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

during 2012 the company will negotiate major labor contracts covering store employees in memphis las vegas dayton and columbus ohio indianapolis louisville nashville phoenix and portland these negotiations will be challenging as the company seeks competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care in these negotiations we will also need to address the underfunding of our multiemployer pension plans 

  

stores 

  

as of january 28 2012 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2435 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 1090 of which had fuel centers approximately 45 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 28 2012 the company operated through subsidiaries 791 convenience stores and 348 fine jewelry stores all of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 83 convenience stores were operated through franchise agreements approximately 51 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline 

  

segments 

  

the company operates retail food and drug stores multidepartment stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states the company’s retail operations which represent over 99 of the company’s consolidated sales and ebitda are its only reportable segment the company’s retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar longterm financial performance in addition the company’s operating divisions offer to its customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the company’s merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location the company’s operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how the company’s chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as the company’s chief operating decision makers assess performance internally all of the company’s operations are domestic revenues profit and losses and total assets are shown in the company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 below 

  

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in the company’s merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately 11000 private label items the company’s corporate brand products are produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the company’s private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it kroger value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price 

  

approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold are produced in the company’s manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to the company’s strict specifications by outside manufacturers the company performs a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 28 2012 the company operated 39 manufacturing plants these plants consisted of 17 dairies 10 deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants three beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants

for the disclosure related to the company’s competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

food safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2012 covering store employees in memphis las vegas dayton and columbus ohio indianapolis louisville nashville phoenix and portland upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations 

  

strategy execution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experiences through improved service product selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or with the permission of the individual although we have implemented procedures to protect our information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate or a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving the information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

indebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2011 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 82 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to the ongoing economic downturn or future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies multiemployer pension plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits and it is probable that the company’s contributions to those funds will have meaningful increases over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company except as noted below there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would affect kroger’s cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multiemployer pension plans in which we participate we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actual cost of current accruals and to fund the preconsolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability “uaal” that existed as of december 31 2011 on or before march 31 2018 we also have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund if investment results fail to meet our expectations we will be responsible for the shortfall 

  

  

insurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

current economic conditions 

  

the global economy and financial markets have experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices availability of credit difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors the decline in the housing market diminished market liquidity low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates as a result consumers have been more cautious consumers have reduced spending and have switched to less expensive mixes of products they also have been patronizing discounters and dollar stores for grocery items to a greater extent all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings increased fuel prices could have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities could interrupt the delivery of products to our stores could substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and could substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc v commissioner of internal revenue docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies asserted by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition therefore does not qualify for a section 338h10 election on january 27 2011 the tax court issued its opinion upholding the company’s position that the acquisition of the stock qualified as a purchase granting the company’s motion for partial summary judgment and denying the tax commissioner’s motion we anticipate that all remaining issues in the matter will be resolved and the tax court will enter its decision the parties will then have 90 days to file an appeal as of january 28 2012 an adverse decision would have required a cash payment of up to approximately 553 million including interest any accounting implications of an adverse decision in this case would be charged through the statement of operations 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for our exposures is not material to the company it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2435 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons jay c food 4 less fred meyer fry’s king soopers qfc ralphs and smith’s of these stores 1090 have fuel centers we also operate 791 convenience stores either directly or through franchisees and 348 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 39 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over 99 of kroger’s consolidated sales and ebitda are our only reportable segment 

  

our 2011 performance 

  

we achieved solid results in 2011 our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count good cost control as well as growth in earnings and earnings per diluted share our 2011 net earnings were 602 million or 101 per diluted share the results included a charge related to the consolidation of multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute totaling 953 million pretax 591 million aftertax excluding the charge our adjusted net earnings were 12 billion or 200 per diluted share our identical supermarket sales increased by 49 excluding fuel we have achieved 33 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel because our business model emphasizes this primary component and identical sales generate earnings and free cash flow that reward our shareholders 

  

increasing market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 50 basis points in 2011 across our 19 marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in 13 of the marketing areas and declined in six walmart supercenters are a primary competitor in 17 of our 19 marketing areas our overall market share grew by approximately 40 basis points in 2011 in those 17 marketing areas nielsen homescan data is generated by customers who selfreport their grocery purchases to nielsen regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet these market share results reflect our longterm strategy of market share growth 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2011 compared to 2010 and for 2010 compared to 2009 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 602 million in 2011 11 billion in 2010 and 70 million in 2009 the net earnings for 2011 include the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge totaling 591 million aftertax the net earnings for 2010 include a noncash goodwill impairment charge totaling 12 million aftertax related to a small number of stores the net earnings for 2009 include noncash asset impairment charges totaling 105 billion aftertax related to a division in southern california the 2009 impairment charge primarily resulted from the writeoff of the ralphs division goodwill balance excluding these charges for 2011 2010 and 2009 adjusted net earnings were 12 billion in 2011 and 11 billion in both 2010 and 2009 2011 adjusted net earnings improved compared to 2010 due to an increase in fifo nonfuel operating profit lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by a lifo charge of 216 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 57 million pretax in 2010 2010 adjusted net earnings improved compared to 2009 due to lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by decreased nonfuel operating profit 

  

2011 net earnings per diluted share totaled 101 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 totaled 200 which excludes the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge 2010 net earnings per diluted share totaled 174 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 totaled 176 which excludes the 002 per diluted share for the noncash goodwill impairment charge net earnings per diluted share was 011 in 2009 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2009 was 171 which excludes the 160 per diluted share for the noncash asset impairment charges adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2011 compared to 2010 increased primarily due to increased retail fuel margins the repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo nonfuel operating profit and the favorable resolution of certain tax issues offset by a lifo charge of 216 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 57 million pretax in 2010 adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 compared to 2009 increased due to increased retail fuel margins the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and the repurchase of kroger common shares partially offset by reduced nonfuel net earnings 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because the onetime charges reflected in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are nonrecurring and are not directly related to our daytoday business 

  

sales 

  

total sales 

 in millions 

  

   

   

the increase in total sales for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 49 and an increase in supermarket fuel sales of 426 total supermarket fuel sales increased over the same period due to a 263 increase in average retail fuel prices and a 130 increase in fuel gallons sold the increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2011 over 2010 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 49 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to inflation increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip 

  

  

the increase in total sales for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 28 and an increase in supermarket fuel sales of 366 total supermarket fuel sales increased over the same period due to a 168 increase in average retail fuel prices and a 172 increase in fuel gallons sold the increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2010 over 2009 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 28 as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of 05 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to inflation increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2011 compared to the 52week period of the previous year the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 

  

identical supermarket sales 

dollars in millions 

  

   

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2113 in 2011 2231 in 2010 and 2325 in 2009 our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased 33 basis points in 2011 and 35 basis points in 2010 fifo gross margin in 2011 compared to 2010 decreased primarily due to continued investments in lower prices for our customers the effect of inflation and higher transportation expenses partially offset by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing expenses as a percentage of sales fifo gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 decreased primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher transportation expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 216 million in 2011 57 million in 2010 and 49 million in 2009 like many food retailers we experienced higher levels of product cost inflation in 2011 compared to 2010 in 2011 our lifo charge primarily resulted from an annualized product cost inflation related to grocery meat and seafood deli and bakery and pharmacy a slight increase in annualized product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2010 compared to 2009 in 2010 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to meat pharmacy and companymanufactured products partially offset by deflation in grocery products in 2009 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to tobacco and pharmacy products 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1698 in 2011 1685 in 2010 and 1751 in 2009 the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales our oga expenses in 2011 included 953 million for the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge without the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased 25 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 the 2011 decrease compared to 2010 resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth productivity improvements and strong cost controls at the store level offset partially by increased credit and debit card fees incentive compensation and health care costs oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased 14 basis points in 2010 compared to 2009 the 2010 decrease compared to 2009 resulted primarily from increased identical supermarket sales growth strong cost controls at the store level and reduced utility costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in pension and health care expenses and credit card fees 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 619 million in 2011 as compared to 623 million in 2010 and 620 million in 2009 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 068 in 2011 as compared to 076 in 2010 and 081 in 2009 the continual decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible a decrease in the number of leased locations and the benefit of increased supermarket sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 16 billion in 2011 16 billion in 2010 and 15 billion in 2009 the increase in depreciation expense from 2010 compared to 2009 was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities totaling 19 billion in 2010 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 181 in 2011 195 in 2010 and 199 in 2009 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 compared to 2010 as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 compared to 2009 as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 435 million in 2011 448 million in 2010 and 502 million in 2009 the decrease in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate and an average lower debt balance for the year offset partially by a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate an average lower debt balance for the year and an increase in our benefit from interest rate swaps 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 293 in 2011 347 in 2010 and 904 in 2009 the 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits and favorable resolution of certain tax issues partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2011 effective tax rate was also lower than 2010 due to the effect on pretax income of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge of 953 million 591 million aftertax excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge our effective rate in 2011 would have been 339 the 2009 effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because the goodwill impairment charge incurred in that year was mostly nondeductible for tax purposes excluding the noncash impairment charges our effective rate in 2009 would have been 358 in addition the effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the expected federal statutory rate due to the utilization of tax credits resolution of certain tax issues and the effect of state income taxes 

  

common share repurchase program 

  

we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger common shares totaling 14 billion in 2011 505 million in 2010 and 156 million in 2009 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 127 million in 2011 40 million in 2010 and 62 million in 2009 of kroger shares under the stock option program 

  

  

on march 3 2011 the board of directors authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program on september 15 2011 the board of directors authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program that replaced the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on march 3 2011 as of january 28 2012 we had 475 million remaining on the september 15 2011 1 billion share repurchase program 

  

capital expenditures 

  

capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 19 billion in 2011 compared to 19 billion in 2010 and 22 billion in 2009 the decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to kroger reducing the capital expenditures in our original plan in order to provide the cash flow necessary to execute our financial strategy capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 60 million in 2011 compared to 38 million for 2010 and 164 million for 2009 the increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores and one large distribution center in 2009 compared to 2010 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 28 2012 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 5 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

  

we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 37 million in 2011 25 million in 2010 and 48 million in 2009 included in the 2009 amount are asset impairments recorded totaling 24 million for the ralphs reporting unit in southern california we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 11 billion as of january 28 2012 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2009 did not result in impairment 

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in an impairment charge of 18 million based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010 a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 18 million 12 million aftertax in 2009 we disclosed that a 10 reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this reporting unit 

  

  

in the third quarter of 2009 our operating performance suffered due to deflation and intense competition during the third quarter of 2009 based on revised forecasts for 2009 and the initial results of our annual budget process of the supermarket reporting units management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing of these reporting units in the third quarter of 2009 we did not test the variable interest entities with recorded goodwill for impairment as no triggering event occurred based on the results of our step one analysis in the third quarter of 2009 the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment in 2009 the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by the economic conditions at the time and responses to competitive actions in southern california as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows along with comparable fair value information management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 1113 1036 aftertax subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a salesweighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value the discounted cash flows assumed longterm sales growth rates comparable to historical performance and a discount rate of 11 in addition the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january 31 2009 assessment based on current and future expected cash flows the company believes additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2011 2010 and 2009 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of yearend 2011 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be “settled” by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 455 and 440 discount rates as of yearend 2011 for pension and other benefits respectively represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broadmarket aa yield curve we utilized a discount rate of 560 and 540 for yearend 2010 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 28 2012 by approximately 406 million 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories for 2011 and 2010 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average rate of return was 72 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2011 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2011 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 16 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 94 the average annual return for the sp 500 over the same period of time has been 87 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an 85 rate of return assumption is reasonable see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 52 million in 2011 141 million in 2010 and 265 million in 2009 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans although we are not required to make cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 75 million to these plans in 2012 additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any contributions made during 2012 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions 

  

we contributed and expensed 130 million in 2011 119 million in 2010 and 115 million in 2009 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

  

multiemployer pension plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” with 14 locals of the ufcw that participated in four multiemployer pension funds the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multiemployer pension funds into one multiemployer pension fund 

  

under the terms of the mou the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through 2021 we were designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated plan with sole investment authority over its assets we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the preconsolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability “uaal” that existed as of december 31 2011 in a series of installments on or before march 31 2018 at january 1 2012 the uaal was estimated to be 911 million pretax in accordance with gaap we expensed 911 million in 2011 related to the uaal the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment as the estimate is updated we may incur additional expense we do not expect any adjustments to be material in the fourth quarter of 2011 we contributed 650 million to the consolidated multiemployer pension plan of which 600 million was allocated to the uaal and 50 million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in 2011 future contributions will be dependent among other things on the investment performance of assets in the plan the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of 946 million in 2011 262 million in 2010 and 233 million in 2009 the cash contributions for 2011 include the company’s 650 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2011 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above as of december 31 2011 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 23 billion pretax or 14 billion aftertax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 280 million pretax or 175 million aftertax as of december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 the december 31 2011 estimate of our underfunding includes the effect of our 650 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan made in january 2012 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the company’s 650 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan partially offset by increases in underfunded amounts in other plans our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2011 excluding the 650 million contribution to our ufcw consolidated pension plan our contributions to these plans increased approximately 13 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 9 since 2006 in 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 240 million to our multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions this amount reflects a contribution decrease due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on current market conditions we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 28 2012 the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years 2005 through 2007 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 of inventories were valued using the lifo method in both 2011 and 2010 cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 10 billion at january 28 2012 and by 827 million at january 29 2011 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 59 billion in 2011 64 billion in 2010 and 57 billion in 2009 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately95 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 27 billion of cash from operations in 2011 compared to 34 billion in 2010 and 29 billion in 2009 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization the lifo charge the goodwill impairment charge and changes in working capital the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the decline in net earnings including noncontrolling interests due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge changes in working capital also provided used cash from operating activities of 300 million in 2011 compared to 698 million in 2010 and 83 million in 2009 the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in inventories offset partially by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in addition the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was partially offset by an increase in other longterm liabilities for our remaining estimated commitment for the uaal in excess of the cash contribution the change in working capital for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses in addition the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was partially offset by a decrease in other longterm liabilities prepaid expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to kroger not prefunding 300 million of employee benefits in 2010 these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 52 million in 2011 141 million in 2010 and 265 million in 2009 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and from the bonus depreciation deductions allowed by the 2010 tax relief act for property placed into service in 2011 the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to reversals of temporary differences in 2010 and overpayments being applied to 2009 income taxes 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 19 billion in 2011 compared to 20 billion in 2010 and 23 billion in 2009 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreased payments for other investing activities offset partially by increased payments for acquisitions the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased payments on capital expenditures capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 19 billion in 2011 19 billion in 2010 and 23 billion in 2009 refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 14 billion of cash in 2011 compared to 10 billion in 2010 and 434 million in 2009 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily related to the increased payments for treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased borrowings under our commercial paper program the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily related to the increased payments on longterm debt and treasury stock repurchases decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and an investment in the remaining interest of a variable interest entity partially offset by decreased payments on the credit facility we repurchased 15 billion of kroger common shares in 2011 compared to 545 million in 2010 and 218 million in 2009 we paid dividends totaling 257 million in 2011 250 million in 2010 and 238 million in 2009 

  

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations increased 273 million to 82 billion as of yearend 2011 compared to yearend 2010 the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted from increased net borrowings of commercial paper of 370 million and the issuance of 450 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 220 offset by the payment at maturity of our 478 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 680 total debt decreased 164 million to 79 billion as of yearend 2010 compared to yearend 2009 the decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 resulted from the payment at maturity of our 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 805 offset by the issuance of 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 540 as of january 28 2012 our cash and temporary cash investments were 188 million compared to 825 million as of january 29 2011 this decrease was primarily due to the payment at maturity of our 478 million of senior notes our 650 million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution and the increased share repurchase activity noted above partially offset by the borrowing of commercial paper and the issuance of our 450 million of senior notes described above 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt in 2009 we prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 24 million in 2011 and 57 million in both 2010 and 2009 

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately 36 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of fiscal year 2011 based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately 13 billion of debt due in the next twelve months which is included in the 36 billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt on favorable terms based on our past experience if necessary we believe we can also fund future scheduled principal payments of longterm debt from our cash flows from operating activities we also currently do not expect to purchase our common shares at the levels we did in 2011 we used our commercial paper program toward the end of 2011 to fund our common share purchases we expect our contributions to the ufcw consolidated pension plan to significantly decrease in future periods we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities in 2012 but do not expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 1 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at january 28 2012 we had 370 million of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio 

  

  

our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

   

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our ufcw consolidated pension plan charge in 2011 our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2011 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 28 2012 in millions of dollars 

  

   

1   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 75 million in 2011 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 946 million in 2011 including our 650 million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan 

2   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 

3   as of january 28 2012 we had 370 million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines 

4   amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january 28 2012 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments 

  

5   the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability have been stated on a present value basis 

  

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 28 2012 we maintained a 2 billion with the ability to increase by 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on january 25 2017 we amended the credit agreement subsequent to yearend 2011 to update our covenants for the exclusion of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge all other terms remained the same outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained two uncommitted money market lines totaling 75 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january 28 2012 we had 370 million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 19 million as of january 28 2012 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 28 2012 we had authorized for issuance 16 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 15 2010 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers’ compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 6 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 28 2012 we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in september 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the twostep impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the new rules are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 however entities were permitted to adopt the standards early we did not adopt these standards early for our 2011 goodwill impairment testing process because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed the amended standards will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2011 the fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all nonowner changes in shareholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new rules were to become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 in december 2011 the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the december 15 2011 effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments because the standards only affect the display of comprehensive income and do not affect what is included in comprehensive income the standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards this amendment primarily changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition the amendment clarified the fasb’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items that are not recorded at fair value but as to which fair value is required to be disclosed the new rules became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 while we are still finalizing our evaluation of the effect of this amended standard on our consolidated financial statements we believe this new standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 28 2012 we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 16 billion to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between april 2012 and april 2013 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of january 28 2012 other longterm assets totaling 25 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt we have unamortized proceeds from nine interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately 5 million the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 

  

as of january 28 2012 we maintained 24 forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between may 2012 and april 2013 with an aggregate notional amount totaling 12 billion a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 the fixed interest rates for these forwardstarting interest rate swaps range from 215 to 326 the variable rate component of the forwardstarting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor accordingly the forwardstarting interest rate swaps were designated as cashflow hedges as defined by gaap as of january 28 2012 the fair value of the interest rates swaps was recorded in other long term liabilities for 41 million and accumulated other comprehensive loss for 26 million net of tax 

  

in addition in 2005 we entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 750 million we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008 in 2007 we terminated two of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 500 million in 2008 we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of 250 million as of january 28 2012 the unamortized payments and proceeds of 5 million 3 million net of tax on these terminated forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

  

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements

the company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its stores the company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to its customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses the company’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to january 31 

  

employees 

  

as of january 29 2011 the company employed approximately 338000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 300 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

during 2011 the company has major labor contracts to be negotiated covering store employees in southern california memphis and west virginia the company will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the midwest negotiations in 2011 will be challenging as the company strives for competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care and maintain our ability to make expected increased contributions to our pension plans 

  

stores 

  

as of january 29 2011 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2460 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 1014 of which had fuel centers approximately 44 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 — 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

many of the stores mentioned above with exception of the price impact warehouse stores include fuel centers 

  

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 29 2011 the company operated through subsidiaries 784 convenience stores and 361 fine jewelry stores all of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 87 convenience stores were operated through franchise agreements approximately 52 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline

merchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in the company’s merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately 11000 private label items the company’s corporate brand products are produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the company’s private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product we must be satisfied that the product quality meets our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it kroger value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price 

  

approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold are produced in the company’s manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to the company’s strict specifications by outside manufacturers the company performs a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 29 2011 the company operated 40 manufacturing plants these plants consisted of 18 dairies 10 deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants three beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants

competitive environment 

  

for the disclosure related to the company’s competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

competitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

food safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

labor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2011 covering store employees in southern california memphis and west virginia the company will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the midwest upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or have sufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations 

  

strategy execution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experiences through improved service product selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 

  

  

through our sales and marketing activities we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business as required by law or with the permission of the individual although we have implemented procedures to protect that information we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ network security and if successful misappropriate confidential customer or business information in addition a kroger associate contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving the information loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations associates and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

indebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2010 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 79 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

multiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements the funding status of most of those pension funds has deteriorated since yearend 2007 and it is probable that the company’s contributions to those funds will have meaningful increases over the next few years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would affect kroger’s cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

insurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

current economic conditions 

  

the global economy and financial markets have experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices availability of credit difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors the decline in the housing market diminished market liquidity falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment rates as a result consumers have been more cautious consumers have reduced spending and have switched to less expensive mixes of products they also have been patronizing discounters and dollar stores for grocery items to a greater extent all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings unrest in the oilproducing countries has resulted in increased fuel prices that could have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

  

weather and natural disasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities could interrupt the delivery of products to our stores could substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and could substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities although our geographic diversity minimizes the risk that a natural disaster will impair the operation of the company as a whole adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

government regulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 2   properties 

  

as of january 29 2011 the company operated more than 3500 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and food processing facilities through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states while the company’s current strategy emphasizes ownership of store real estate a majority of the properties used to conduct the company’s business are leased 

  

the company generally owns store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and manufacturing equipment the total cost of the company’s owned assets and capitalized leases at january 29 2011 was 267 billion while the accumulated depreciation was 126 billion 

  

leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution manufacturing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc v commissioner of internal revenue docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies asserted by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition therefore does not qualify for a section 338h10 election on january 27 2011 the tax court issued its opinion upholding the company’s position that the acquisition of the stock qualified as a purchase granting the company’s motion for partial summary judgment and denying the tax commissioner’s motion we anticipate that all remaining issues in the matter will be resolved and the tax court will enter its decision the parties will then have 90 days to file an appeal as of january 29 2011 an adverse decision would have required a cash payment of up to approximately 516 million including interest any accounting implications of an adverse decision in this case would be charged through the statement of operations 

  

on february 2 2004 the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court  california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertson’s inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co  united states district court central district of california case no cv040687 alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the “agreement” between the company albertson’s inc and safeway inc collectively the “retailers” which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailers but not the other retailers during the labor dispute in southern california violated section 1 of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may 28 2008 pursuant to a stipulation between the parties the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants the attorney general appealed a trial court ruling to the ninth circuit court of appeals and the defendants appealed a separate ruling on august 17 2010 the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the agreement violated section 1 of the sherman act and it remanded the matter to the district court for entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and for any further proceedings consistent with its opinion on february 11 2011 the court determined to rehear the appeal en banc  based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

historically our peer group has consisted of the major food store companies in recent years there have been significant changes in the industry including consolidation and increased competition from supercenters drug chains and discount stores as a result several years ago we changed our peer group to include companies operating supermarkets supercenters and warehouse clubs in the united states as well as the major drug chains with which kroger competes in 2008 we changed our peer group the “peer group” once again to add tesco plc as it has become a competitor in the us market

market share is an important part of our longterm strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 80 basis points in 2010 across the 19 marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in 13 of the marketing areas declined slightly in four and remained unchanged in two our overall market share grew by approximately 75 basis points in 2010 in 17 of the 19 marketing areas where walmart supercenters are a primary competitor nielsen homescan data is generated by customers who selfreport their grocery purchases to nielsen regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet this data illustrates that not only are we growing bigger among traditional grocers we are also gaining ground in the larger retail market for grocery and consumable items which includes many nontraditional competitors these market share results are consistent with our longterm strategy 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2010 compared to 2009 and for 2009 compared to 2008 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 11 billion in 2010 70 million in 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 the net earnings for 2010 include a noncash goodwill impairment charge totaling 12 million aftertax related to a small number of stores the net earnings for 2009 include noncash asset impairment charges totaling 105 billion aftertax related to a division in southern california the “noncash impairment charges” the 2009 impairment primarily resulted from the writeoff of the ralphs division goodwill balance excluding these impairments charges for 2010 and 2009 adjusted net earnings for both 2010 and 2009 would have been 11 billion adjusted net earnings for 2010 improved due to lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by decreased nonfuel operating profit and a lifo charge of 57 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 49 million pretax in 2009 the decrease in adjusted net earnings for 2009 compared to 2008 net earnings resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by a lifo charge of 49 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 196 million pretax in 2008 2008 net earnings also included aftertax costs of 16 million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are nonrecurring noncash charges that are not directly related to our daytoday business 

  

2010 net earnings per diluted share totaled 174 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 totaled 176 which excludes the 002 per diluted share for the noncash goodwill impairment charge net earnings per diluted share was 011 in 2009 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2009 was 171 which excludes the 160 per diluted share for the noncash asset impairment charges net earnings per diluted share totaled 189 in 2008 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2008 was 191 which excludes the 002 per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 increased due to increased retail fuel margins and the repurchase of kroger stock partially offset by reduced nonfuel net earnings the decline in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2009 resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by lower lifo charges and aftertax costs of 16 million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike in 2008 

  

sales 

  

total sales 

in millions 

  

   

   

the increase in total sales for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of 28 and an increase in supermarket fuel sales of 366 total supermarket fuel sales increased over the same period due to a 168 increase in average retail fuel prices and a 172 increase in fuel gallons sold the increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2010 over 2009 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 28 as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of 05 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to inflation increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip 

  

  

the slight increase in total sales for 2009 compared to 2008 was attributable to our 21 increase in identical sales offset by our yearoveryear decline in supermarket fuel sales of approximately 106 total supermarket fuel sales declined over the same period due to a decline in retail fuel prices of approximately 236 offset partially by a 172 increase in gallons sold retail fuel prices decreased by approximately 236 yearoveryear in 2009 compared to 2008 due to deflation in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2009 over 2008 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales of 21 as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of 08 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2010 compared to the 52week period of the previous year the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

  

identical supermarket sales 

dollars in millions 

  

   

we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations as is the case for identical supermarket sales fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2010 compared to the same 52week period of the previous year the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

  

comparable supermarket sales

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2229 in 2010 2323 in 2009 and 2338 in 2008 our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased 33 basis points in 2010 and 58 basis points in 2009 fifo gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 decreased primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher transportation expenses as a percentage of sales in addition fifo gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation partially offset by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing and transportation expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 57 million in 2010 49 million in 2009 and 196 million in 2008 a slight increase in annualized product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2010 compared to 2009 in 2010 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to meat pharmacy and company manufactured products partially offset by deflation in grocery products the lifo charge in 2009 compared to 2008 decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the lifo method of valuation for 2009 compared to 2008 the last three quarters of 2009 experienced product cost deflation excluding fuel in 2009 our lifo charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to tobacco and pharmacy products 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1680 in 2010 1746 in 2009 and 1714 in 2008 the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased 14 basis points in 2010 compared to 2009 the 2010 decrease compared to 2009 resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth strong cost controls at the store level and reduced utility costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in pension and health care expenses and credit card fees oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased 3 basis points in 2009 compared to 2008 the 2009 decrease compared to 2008 resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth a reduction in bag expense lower incentive compensation and reduced utility costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees health care costs and wages 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 651 million in 2010 as compared to 648 million in 2009 and 659 million in 2008 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 079 in 2010 as compared to 084 in 2009 and 087 in 2008 the continual decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of increased supermarket sales 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 16 billion in 2010 15 billion in 2009 and 14 billion in 2008 the increase in depreciation expense from 2010 compared to 2009 was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities totaling 19 billion in 2010 the increase in depreciation expense from 2009 compared to 2008 was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities totaling 24 billion in 2009 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 195 in 2010 199 in 2009 and 189 in 2008 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 compared to 2009 as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 compared to 2008 as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increased depreciation expense and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity deflation and yearoveryear decline in retail fuel prices 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 448 million in 2010 502 million in 2009 and 485 million in 2008 the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate an average lower debt balance for the year and an increase in our benefit from interest rate swaps the increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps 

  

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 347 in 2010 904 in 2009 and 365 in 2008 the 2010 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax issues partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the 2009 effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because the goodwill impairment charge incurred in that year was mostly nondeductible for tax purposes excluding the noncash impairment charges our effective rate in 2009 would have been 358 in addition the effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of certain tax issues and the effect of state income taxes the 2008 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 

  

common stock repurchase program 

  

we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger stock totaling 505 million in 2010 156 million in 2009 and 448 million in 2008 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 40 million in 2010 62 million in 2009 and 189 million in 2008 of kroger stock under the stock option program 

  

on march 3 2011 the board of directors authorized an additional 1 billion stock repurchase program 

  

capital expenditures 

  

capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 19 billion in 2010 compared to 22 billion in 2009 and 21 billion in 2008 the decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 was due to kroger reducing the capital expenditures in our original plan in order to provide the cash flow necessary to execute our financial strategy the increase in capital spending in 2009 compared to 2008 was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 38 million in 2010 compared to 164 million for 2009 and 27 million for 2008 the decrease in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities compared to 2009 was due to kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores and one large distribution center in 2009 compared to 2010 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

critical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 29 2011 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 5 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 25 million in 2010 48 million in 2009 and 26 million in 2008 included in the 2009 amount are asset impairments recorded totaling 24 million for a southern california reporting unit we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 11 billion as of january 29 2011 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

  

the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in an impairment charge of 18 million based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010 a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value due to the decreased fair value of the reporting unit resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 18 million 12 million aftertax in 2009 we disclosed that a 10 reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this reporting unit 

  

in the third quarter of 2009 our operating performance suffered due to deflation and intense competition during the third quarter of 2009 based on revised forecasts for 2009 and the initial results of our annual budget process of the supermarket reporting units management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing of these reporting units in the third quarter of 2009 we did not test the variable interest entities with recorded goodwill for impairment as no triggering event occurred based on the results of our step one analysis in the third quarter of 2009 the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment in 2009 the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by the economic conditions at the time and responses to competitive actions in southern california as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows along with comparable fair value information management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 1113 1036 aftertax subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a salesweighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value the discounted cash flows assume longterm sales growth rates comparable to historical performance and a discount rate of 11 in addition the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january 31 2009 assessment 

  

based on current and future expected cash flows the company believes additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible a 10 reduction in fair value of the company’s reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of the company’s remaining goodwill balance except for one nonsupermarket reporting unit with recorded goodwill of 77 the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using discounted cash flows the discounted cash flows assume longterm sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of 125 

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2010 2009 and 2008 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

a companysponsored defined benefit pension plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of yearend 2010 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be “settled” by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 560 and 540 discount rates as of yearend 2010 for pension and other benefits respectively represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broadmarket aa yield curve we utilized a discount rate of 600 and 580 for yearend 2009 for pension and other benefits respectively a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 29 2011 by approximately 342 million 

  

to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories for 2010 and 2009 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average rate of return was 66 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2010 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2010 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 150 primarily due to the strength of the market in 2010 for the past 20 years our average annual rate of return has been 107 the average annual return for the sp 500 over the same period of time has been 99 based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an 85 rate of return assumption is reasonable see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 141 million in 2010 265 million in 2009 and 20 million in 2008 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans we do not expect to make a cash contribution to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans in 2011 contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any contributions made during 2011 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions 

  

  

we contributed and expensed 119 million in 2010 115 million in 2009 and 92 million in 2008 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the 401k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

b multiemployer plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 262 million in 2010 233 million in 2009 and 219 million in 2008 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2010 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer as of december 31 2010 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 25 billion pretax or 16 billion aftertax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately 125 million pretax or 75 million aftertax as of december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2010 our contributions to these plans increased approximately 12 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 7 since 2005 in 2011 we expect to contribute approximately 300 million to our multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions based on current market conditions we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 

  

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 29 2011 the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years 2005 through 2007 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 of inventories were valued using the lifo method in both 2010 and 2009 cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 827 million at january 29 2011 and by 770 million at january 30 2010 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 64 billion in 2010 57 billion in 2009 and 52 billion in 2008 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs all years presented now include amounts for certain vendorfunded electronic promotions we recognized approximately 95 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 34 billion of cash from operations in 2010 compared to 29 billion in 2009 and 2008 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization the goodwill impairment charge and changes in working capital changes in working capital provided cash from operating activities of 698 million in 2010 compared to 83 million in 2009 and 421 million in 2008 the change in working capital for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses in addition the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was partially offset by a decrease in other longterm liabilities prepaid expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 due to kroger not prefunding 300 million of employee benefits in 2010 the increase in the change in working capital for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in the net income taxes receivable and payable along with a slight increase in inventory in 2009 compared to a larger increase in inventory in 2008 these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 141 million in 2010 265 million in 2009 and 20 million in 2008 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to reversals of temporary differences in 2010 and overpayments being applied to 2009 income taxes the amount decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to applying our fiscal 2008 overpayment of income taxes to 2009 income taxes 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 20 billion in 2010 compared to 23 billion in 2009 and 22 billion in 2008 the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased payments on capital expenditures the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to higher capital spending partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 19 billion in 2010 23 billion in 2009 and 22 billion in 2008 refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 10 billion of cash in 2010 compared to 434 million in 2009 and 769 million in 2008 the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily related to the increased payments on longterm debt and treasury stock repurchases decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and an investment in the remaining interest of a variable interest entity partially offset by decreased payments on the credit facility the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on longterm debt and our credit facility offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and capital stock we repurchased 545 million of kroger stock in 2010 compared to 218 million in 2009 and 637 million in 2008 we paid dividends totaling 250 million in 2010 238 million in 2009 and 227 million in 2008 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations decreased 164 million to 79 billion as of yearend 2010 compared to yearend 2009 the decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 resulted from the payment at maturity of our 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 805 offset by the issuance of 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 540 total debt decreased 7 million to 81 billion as of yearend 2009 compared to yearend 2008 the decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from the payment at maturity of our 350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 725 decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines offset by the issuance of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 390 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million in each of the two years ended 2009 and 2008 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 57 million in both 2010 and 2009 

  

  

liquidity needs 

  

we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately 20 billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of fiscal year 2010 based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months in addition to the sources of liquidity noted above we also expect to be able to fund future scheduled principal payments of longterm debt from our cash flows from operating activities and if necessary by issuing additional debt we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 1 billion under our commercial paper “cp” program at january 29 2011 we did not have any cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our shortterm credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 500 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our credit default swap spread or an increase in our leverage ratio 

  

our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

   

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our noncash asset impairment charges related to goodwill in 2010 and 2009 our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2010 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 29 2011 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 29 2011 we maintained a 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on may 15 2014 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling 100 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january 29 2011 we had no borrowings under our credit agreement money market lines or outstanding commercial paper the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 134 million as of january 29 2011 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 29 2011 we had authorized for issuance 2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 15 2010 

  

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 29 2011 we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in january 2010 the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures which were effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for disclosures about certain level 3 activity that will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 the new standards require us to disclose transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in level 3 fair value measurements the new standards also require a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements we adopted the amended standards effective january 31 2010 except for disclosures about certain level 3 activity which will be effective starting january 30 2011 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for our fair value measurements and disclosures 

  

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of vies which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standards require an entity to analyze whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary the new standards amend gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments the new standards also require enhanced disclosures regarding an entity’s involvement in a vie we adopted the amended standards effective january 31 2010 the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

effective february 1 2009 we adopted the new standards that clarify that sharebased payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of eps pursuant to the twoclass method see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of its adoption 

  

  

outlook 

  

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

·   we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of 180192 for 2011 we expect the second and third quarter earnings per diluted share growth rate to be below the annual growth rate due to tax benefits recognized in 2010 the growth in the second quarter is expected to be the lowest of the year 

  

·   we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of 3040 in 2011 

  

·   for 2011 we will continue to focus on improving sales growth in accordance with our customer 1 st strategy by making investments in gross margin and customer shopping experiences we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions we expect nonfuel operating margins for 2011 to be comparable to 2010 excluding the noncash goodwill impairment charge 

  

·   for 2011 we expect fuel margins which can be highly volatile to be approximately 0115 per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold 

  

·   for 2011 we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately 50 million to 75 million this forecast is based on estimated cost changes for products in our inventory 

  

·   for 2011 we expect interest expense to be approximately 460 million 

  

·   we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to maintain our current debt coverage ratios to pay cash dividends and to repurchase stock as market conditions change we reevaluate these uses of cash flow 

  

·   we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 

  

·   capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels in addition we will continue our emphasis on selfdevelopment and ownership of real estate logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investments for 2011 to be in the range of 1719 billion excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately 1015 before acquisitions and operational closings 

  

·   based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

·   we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit facility and other borrowing sources 

  

  

·   we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases 

  

·   we expect that our effective tax rate for 2011 will be approximately 360 excluding the resolution of any tax issues 

  

·   we expect rent expense as a percentage of total sales and excluding closedstore activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 

  

·   we believe that in 2011 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration productivity improvements shrink warehousing and transportation we intend to invest most of these savings in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 

  

·   we do not expect to make a cash contribution to the companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2011 if a contribution is made to the companysponsored defined benefit pension plans we expect any elective contributions made during 2011 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we expect 2011 expense for companysponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately 80 million in addition we expect 401k retirement savings account plan cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

·   we expect to contribute approximately 300 million to multiemployer pension plans in 2011 subject to collective bargaining in addition we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next few years 

  

·   we do not anticipate additional goodwill impairments in 2011 

  

·   we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2011 covering store employees in southern california memphis and west virginia we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operation in the midwest upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 

  

·   we expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of 60 to 80 over each rolling three to five year time period including our dividend our business model is expected to generate total shareholder return on average of 80 to 100 over each rolling three to five year time period 

  

various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include 

  

·   the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us 

  

·   changes in market conditions could affect our cash flow 

  

  

   

  

   

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 29 2011 we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 16 billion to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between april 2012 and april 2013 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of january 29 2011 other longterm assets totaling 45 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately 16 million the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 

  

in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above in 2005 we entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 750 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008 in 2007 we terminated two of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 500 million in 2008 we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of 250 million as of january 29 2011 the unamortized payments and proceeds of 8 million 5 million net of tax on these terminated forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january 29 2011 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january 29 2011 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 29 2011 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january 29 2011 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

   

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

e mployees 

  

as of january 30 2010 the company employed approximately 334000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 305 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years

s tores 

  

as of january 30 2010 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2468 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 893 of which had fuel centers approximately 43 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a 2 – 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

many of the stores mentioned above with exception of the price impact warehouse stores include fuel centers 

  

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 30 2010 the company operated through subsidiaries 777 convenience stores and 374 fine jewelry stores all of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 87 convenience stores were operated through franchise agreements approximately 51 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline

for the disclosure related to the company’s competitive environment see item 1a under the heading “competitive environment” 

  

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

c ompetitive e nvironment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition including our execution of our strategic plan and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth has been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

f ood s afety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

l abor r elations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we are a party to approximately 305 collective bargaining agreements we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2010 covering store employees in albuquerque cincinnati dallas detroit ft wayne houston little rock portland seattle and toledo we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters for employees in california and portland upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations 

  

s trategy e xecution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experiences through improved service product selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations additionally these systems contain valuable proprietary and financial data and a breach could have an adverse effect on kroger 

  

  

i ndebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2009 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 81 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

l egal p roceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable for financial reasons or otherwise to satisfy a judgment entered against them others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

m ulti e mployer p ension o bligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements the funding status of most of those pension funds has deteriorated  since yearend 2007  and it is probable that the company’s contributions to those funds will increase significantly over the next several years a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would affect kroger’s cost of borrowing and access to capital 

  

i nsurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

c urrent e conomic c onditions 

  

the global economy and financial markets have declined and experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices availability of credit difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors the decline in the housing market diminished market liquidity falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment rates as a result consumers are more cautious this led to reduced consumer spending to consumers switching to a less expensive mix of products and to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings in 2009 we experienced overall deflation excluding fuel in this uncertain economy it is difficult to forecast whether 2010 will be a period of inflation or deflation food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings while food inflation combined with reduced consumer spending could reduce gross profit margins and earnings we are unable to predict when the global economy and financial markets will improve if the global economy and financial markets do not improve or if they worsen our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

  

w eather and n atural d isasters 

  

a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes tornadoes floods and earthquakes weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities could interrupt the delivery of products to our stores could substantially increase the cost of products including supplies and materials and could substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities although our geographic diversity minimizes the risk that a natural disaster will impair the operation of the company as a whole adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

g overnment r egulation 

  

our stores are subject to various laws regulations and administrative practices that affect our business we must comply with numerous provisions regulating among other things health and sanitation standards food labeling and safety equal employment opportunity minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food drugs and alcoholic beverages we cannot predict future laws regulations interpretations administrative orders or applications or the effect they will have on our operations they could however significantly increase the cost of doing business they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell or manufacture for sale to third parties to meet new standards we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated these changes could result in additional record keeping expanded documentation of the properties of certain products expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on march 9 2010 the company filed an action  the kroger co et al v excentus corporation  case no 110cv00161ssb in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio western division at cincinnati seeking a declaration that the company’s actions related to fuel rewards programs do not infringe certain patents allegedly held by excentus corporation and that certain patents allegedly held by excentus corporation are invalid shortly after the company filed the action also on march 9 2010 excentus corporation filed an action against the company  excentus corporation v the kroger co  case no 310cv00483 in the united states district court for the northern district of texas dallas division seeking to recover damages from the company for its alleged infringement of patents claimed to be held by excentus corporation and seeking with injunctive relief enjoining the company from infringing the patents by reason of its actions related to fuel reward programs although these lawsuits are subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process and have only recently been filed based on the information available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the us tax court  in re ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies set by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner has determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition does not qualify as a purchase the company believes that it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it is more likely than not that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the litigation process there can be no assurances that the tax court will rule in favor of the company a decision on this case is expected within the next 12 months as of january 30 2010 an adverse decision would require a cash payment of up to approximately 488 million including interest any accounting implications of an adverse decision in this case would be charged through the statement of operations 

  

on february 2 2004 the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court  california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertson’s inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co  united states district court central district of california case no cv040687 alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the “agreement” between the company albertson’s inc and safeway inc collectively the “retailers” which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailers but not the other retailers during a labor dispute in southern california violated section 1 of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may 28 2008 pursuant to a stipulation between the parties the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants as a result of the stipulation and final judgment there are no further claims to be litigated at the trial court level the attorney general has appealed a trial court ruling to the ninth circuit court of appeals and the defendants are appealing a separate ruling although this lawsuit is subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

o ur b usiness 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2468 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food 4 less king soopers smith’s fry’s fry’s marketplace dillons qfc and city market of these stores 893 have fuel centers we also operate 777 convenience stores and 374 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 39 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 

  

o ur 2009 p erformance 

  

by focusing on the customer through our customer 1 st strategy we were able to report solid results in 2009  excluding the noncash asset impairment charges totaling 114 billion pretax 105 billion aftertax related to our division in southern california during what continues to be a difficult operating environment in 2009 our identical supermarket sales increased 21 excluding fuel our 2009 earnings were 011 per diluted share or 171 per diluted share excluding the noncash asset impairment charges referred to above we did not achieve our original goals for identical supermarket sales growth of 3 to 4 and earnings per share of 200 to 205 per diluted share as cautious consumers significant deflation and intense competition affected margins and sales growth nonetheless we strengthened our overall competitive position by increasing the number of households that are loyal to kroger and we are earning a greater share of their business as a result we continue to generate tonnage growth in both perishable and nonperishable categories that is among the strongest in the industry sustainable identical sales and earnings growth remains one of our key longterm objectives we continue to widen the gap between our identical supermarkets sales growth trends and those of several of our competitors we believe this has extremely positive implications for our associates customers and shareholders now and as we grow our business in the future 

  

market share is an important part of our longterm strategy market share is important to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 60 basis points in 2009 across the 17 divisions in which we operate nielsen homescan data includes scanned products across many retail channels not including restaurants this information also indicates that our market share increased in 13 of the divisions declined in three and remained unchanged in one these market share results are consistent with our longterm strategy 

  

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2009 compared to 2008 and for 2008 compared to 2007 comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 70 million for 2009 compared to net earnings totaling 12 billion in each of 2008 and 2007 the net earnings for 2009 include noncash asset impairment charges totaling 105 billion aftertax related to a division in southern california the “noncash impairment charges” the impairment primarily resulted from the writeoff of the ralphs division goodwill balance excluding these impairment charges adjusted net earnings for the year would have been 11 billion additionally the decrease in net earnings for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by a lifo charge of 49 million pretax compared to a lifo charge of 196 million pretax in 2008 2008 net earnings also included aftertax costs of 16 million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike the slight increase in our net earnings for 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from strong nonfuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results 

  

management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share in 2009 are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are nonrecurring noncash charges that are not directly related to our daytoday business we also excluded these charges from our incentive plan calculations for the year 

  

2009 earnings per diluted share totaled 011 and 2009 adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled 171 compared to 189 in 2008 or 191 excluding the 02 per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike and 173 in 2007 the decline in adjusted net earnings per share in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by lower lifo charges and aftertax costs of 16 million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike in 2008 our earnings per share growth in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from increased net earnings strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of kroger stock 

  

sales 

  

total sales 

in millions 

  

   

1   other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores including fuel jewelry stores sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers and variable interest entities 

  

the slight increase in total sales and the decrease in other sales and total supermarket fuel sales for 2009 compared to 2008 was attributable to the yearoveryear decline in retail fuel prices the change in our total supermarket sales without fuel for 2009 over 2008 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales and retail square footage identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2009 compared to the 52week period of the previous year the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

  

  

identical supermarket sales

we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations as is the case for identical supermarket sales fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2009 compared to the same 52week period of the previous year the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were 2323 in 2009 2338 in 2008 and 2386 in 2007 our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased 58 basis points in 2009 and 19 basis points in 2008 the decrease in our nonfuel fifo gross margin rate since 2007 reflects our continued investments in our customer 1 st strategy in addition fifo gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation partially offset by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing and transportation expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 49 million in 2009 196 million in 2008 and 108 million in 2007 the lifo charge in 2009 compared to 2008 decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the lifo method of valuation for 2009 compared to 2008 the last three quarters of 2009 experienced product cost deflation excluding fuel in 2009 our lifo charge primarily resulted from product cost inflation related to tobacco products and pharmacy an increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

we revised our 2007 lifo charge by 46 million pretax 29 million aftertax this revision was made to account for certain promotional allowances in our lifo indices in 2007 we believe this adjustment is not material to any individual year or any quarterly period within such years presented see footnote 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

  

oga expenses as a percentage of sales were 1746 in 2009 1714 in 2008 and 1744 in 2007 the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased 3 basis points in 2009 compared to 2008 oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in 2008 decreased 3 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 the 2009 decrease compared to 2008 resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth a reduction in bag expense lower incentive compensation and reduced utility costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees health care costs and wages wage expenses have increased due to increased hours worked and lower employee turnover in the current economic environment which has resulted in increased average hourly wages the decrease in our oga rate in 2008 excluding the effect of retail fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers partially offset by increases in credit card fees and health care costs 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 648 million in 2009 as compared to 659 million in 2008 and 643 million in 2007 rent expense as a percentage of sales was 084 in 2009 as compared to 087 in 2008 and 091 in 2007 the decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 15 billion in 2009 and 14 billion in 2008 and 2007 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities totaling 24 billion in 2009 22 billion in 2008 and 21 billion in 2007 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was 199 in 2009 189 in 2008 and 193 in 2007 the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 compared to 2008 as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increased depreciation expense and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity deflation and yearoveryear decline in retail fuel prices the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 compared to 2007 as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 502 million in 2009 485 million in 2008 and 474 million in 2007 the increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps the increase in interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year partially offset by interest income related to the marktomarket of ineffective fair value swaps 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 904 in 2009 365 in 2008 and 352 in 2007 the 2009 effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge being mostly nondeductible for tax purposes excluding the noncash impairment charges our effective rate in 2009 was 358 the 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes in addition the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2007 differ from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues with the taxing authorities 

  

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  

we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger stock totaling 156 million in 2009 448 million in 2008 and 12 billion in 2007 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 62 million in 2009 189 million in 2008 and 270 million in 2007 of kroger stock under the stock option program 

  

in 2009 and 2008 to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 

  

  

c apital e xpenditures 

  

capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled 22 billion in 2009 compared to 21 billion in 2008 and 2007 the increase in capital spending in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects during 2009 capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled 164 million compared to 27 million for 2008 this increase was due to kroger purchasing several previously leased retail stores one office building and one distribution center at very attractive rates during 2009 the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 30 2010 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 5 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 48 million in 2009 26 million in 2008 and 24 million in 2007 included in the 2009 amount are asset impairments recorded totaling 24 million for a southern california reporting unit we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

our goodwill totaled 12 billion as of january 30 2010 we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

in the third quarter of 2009 our operating performance suffered due to persistent deflation and intense competition based on our revised forecast during the third quarter of 2009 and the initial results of our 2010 annual budget process for the supermarket reporting units management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing at these reporting units we did not test for impairment our variable interest entities with recorded goodwill balances as no triggering event occurred the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by economic conditions and responses to competitive actions in southern california as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows along with comparable fair value information management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a salesweighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value the discounted cash flows assume longterm sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of 11 in addition the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january 31 2009 assessment we performed our annual assessment in the fourth quarter for all supermarket and variable interest entity “vie” reporting units with goodwill balances based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible a 10 reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our remaining goodwill balance except for one supermarket reporting unit and one vie reporting unit with recorded goodwill of 19 million and 102 million respectively 

  

  

for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2009 2008 and 2007 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

a companysponsored defined benefit pension plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized we adopted the measurement date provisions of gaap effective february 3 2008 the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december 31 measurement date all plans are measured as of our fiscal year end the noncash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of gaap decreased shareowners’ equity by approximately 5 million 3 million aftertax and increased longterm liabilities by approximately 5 million there was no effect on our results of operations 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

  

the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of yearend 2009 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be “settled” by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 600 and 580 discount rates as of yearend 2009 for pension and other benefits respectively represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broadmarket aa yield curve we utilized a discount rate of 700 for yearend 2008 for both pension and other benefits a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 30 2010 by approximately 317 million 

  

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for 2009 and 2008 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average return was 59 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2009 net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2009 net of investment management fees and expenses increased 238 primarily due to the strength of the market in 2009 we believe our 85 pension return assumption is appropriate for the past 20 years our average annual return has been 100 the average annual return for the sp 500 over the same period of time has been 93 in addition forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations indicate an 85 return assumption is reasonable see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 265 million in 2009 20 million in 2008 and 52 million in 2007 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans although we are not required to make cash contributions to companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2010 we expect to contribute approximately 110 million to these plans in 2010 additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any elective contributions made during 2010 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  

we contributed and expensed 115 million in 2009 92 million in 2008 and 90 million in 2007 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts the 401k retirement savings account plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service 

  

b multiemployer plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 233 million in 2009 219 million in 2008 and 207 million in 2007 

  

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2009 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer as of december 31 2009 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 27 billion pretax or 17 billion aftertax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of 380 million pretax or 238 million aftertax as of december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2009 our contributions to these plans increased approximately 6 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6 since 2004 in 2010 we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to our multiemployer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions based on current market conditions we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next five years but we believe it is unlikely that contributions will double during that period which is a change from our estimate at yearend 2008 finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

effective february 4 2007 we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes these standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return these standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january 30 2010 the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years 2002 through 2004 

  

the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions 

  

  

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted after january 29 2006 as well as all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 29 2006 we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 in 2009 and 98 in 2008 of inventories were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 803 million at january 30 2010 and by 754 million at january 31 2009 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 54 billion in 2009 50 billion in 2008 and 51 billion in 2007 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs all years presented now include amounts for certain vendor allowances related to directed store deliveries we recognized approximately 94 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 

  

  

l iquidity and c apital r esources 

  

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 29 billion of cash from operations in 2009 and 2008 compared to 26 billion in 2007 the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment charge and changes in our operating assets and liabilities we realized an increase in cash of 6 million in 2009 and decreases in cash of 412 million in 2008 and 179 million in 2007 from changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to an increase in the changes of income taxes receivable and payable accounts payable and inventories offset partially by decreases in the changes of deposits intransit and prepaid expenses the decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to a decrease in the change in income taxes receivable and payable these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 265 million in 2009 20 million in 2008 and 51 million in 2007 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 because we applied our 2008 overpayment of income taxes to current year taxes the 2008 overpayment resulted primarily from accounting method changes related to asset capitalization 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 23 billion in 2009 compared to 22 billion in 2008 and 2007 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to higher capital spending partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in 2008 compared to 2007 capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 23 billion in 2009 22 billion in 2008 and 21 billion in 2007 refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 434 million of cash in 2009 compared to 769 million in 2008 and 310 million in 2007 the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on longterm debt and our credit facility offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and capital stock the increase in the amount of cash used in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily a result of payments on long termdebt and the bank revolver offset by decreased stock repurchases we repurchased 218 million of kroger stock in 2009 compared to 637 million in 2008 and 14 billion in 2007 we paid dividends totaling 238 million in 2009 227 million in 2008 and 202 million in 2007 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and leasefinancing obligations decreased 7 million to 81 billion as of yearend 2009 compared to yearend 2008 the decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from the issuance of 500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 390 offset by payment at maturity of our 350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 725 decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines total debt decreased 59 million to 81 billion as of yearend 2008 compared to yearend 2007 the decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from the issuance of 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 500 375 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 690 and 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 750 offset by decreased commercial paper the payments on the bank revolver the repayment of 200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6375 and 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 745 that came due in 2008 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million in each of the three years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 57 million in 2009 and 45 million in 2008 

  

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 1 billion under our a2p2f2 rated commercial paper “cp” program at january 30 2010 we did not have any cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa2bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating and lower the amount we are able to borrow on a daily basis under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than 400 million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 

  

our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense as defined in the credit facility was 769 to 1 as of january 30 2010 our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our applicable percentage ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility 

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 222 to 1 as of january 30 2010 if this ratio exceeded 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 382 to 1 as of january 30 2010 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 

  

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our noncash asset impairment charge related to goodwill in 2009 our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2009 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 30 2010 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 30 2010 we maintained a 25 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates in 2011 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling 100 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january 30 2010 we had no borrowings under our credit agreement money market lines or outstanding commercial paper the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 313 million as of january 30 2010 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 30 2010 we had authorized for issuance 900 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 20 2007 

  

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of our subsidiaries see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 30 2010 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also agreed to guarantee up to 25 million the indebtedness of an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility as of january 30 2010 should the entity be unable to meet its obligations totals approximately 25 million and is collateralized by approximately 9 million of inventory located in our stores we consolidate this entity because we are the primary beneficiary and therefore the entire 25 million is a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

in december 2008 the fasb amended its existing standards to provide additional guidance on employers’ disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans the new standards require disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made the fair value of each major category of plan assets valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets the effect of measurements on changes in plan assets when using significant unobservable inputs and significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets the new standards become effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 we adopted the amended standards effective january 30 2010 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures 

  

effective may 24 2009 we adopted new standards for subsequent events the purpose of the new standards is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures 

  

effective may 24 2009 we adopted new standards that effect the accounting and disclosures related to certain financial instruments including a providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased b identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly c amending the otherthantemporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of otherthantemporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements and d requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements the new disclosures are included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

effective february 1 2009 we adopted the new standards that require enhanced disclosures on an entity’s derivative and hedging activities the new disclosures are included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

effective february 1 2009 we adopted the new standards that clarify that sharebased payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of eps pursuant to the twoclass method see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of its adoption 

  

effective february 1 2009 we adopted new standards related to business combinations the new standards expand the definitions of a business and the fair value measurement and reporting in a business combination all business combinations completed after february 1 2009 will be accounted for under the new standards 

  

effective february 1 2009 we adopted new standards that deferred the fair value disclosures for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new standards 

  

in december 2007 the fasb amended its existing standards for a parent’s noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to the subsidiary the new standard defines a noncontrolling interest previously called a minority interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent the new standard requires among other things that a noncontrolling interest be clearly identified labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as equity but separate from the parent’s equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and that if a subsidiary is deconsolidated the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent retains in the former subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment we adopted the new standard effective february 1 2009 and applied it retrospectively as a result we reclassified noncontrolling interests in amounts of 95 from the mezzanine section to equity in the january 31 2009 consolidated balance sheet certain reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard recorded amounts for prior periods previously presented as net earnings which are now presented as net earnings attributable to the kroger co have not changed as a result of the adoption of the new standard 

  

effective january 31 2009 we adopted the amended standards related to disclosures about interests in vies these amended standards require additional disclosures about an entity’s involvement with vies and transfers of financial assets the adoption of these new amended standards did not change any disclosures in our consolidated financial statements due to our vies being immaterial

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the new standards will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january 31 2010 while we are still finalizing the evaluation of the impact of these amended standards on our consolidated financial statements we believe these new standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued guidance that amends and clarifies existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures this guidance requires new disclosures for 1 transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 and reasons for such transfers and 2 the separate presentation of purchases sales issuances and settlement in the level 3 reconciliation it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level 2 and level 3 fair value measurements this guidance is effective for our first quarter of 2010 except for the new disclosures in the level 3 reconciliation the level 3 disclosures are effective for our first quarter of 2011 we do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

·   we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of 160180 for 2010 

  

·   we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of 2030 in 2010 

  

·   for 2010 we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions we expect nonfuel operating margins to have a slight reduction to a slight improvement in rate in 2010 from 2009 excluding the noncash impairment charges recorded 

  

·   for 2010 we expect fuel margins which can be highly volatile to be approximately 011 per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold 

  

·   for 2010 we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately 50 million this forecast is based on cost changes for products in our inventory 

  

·   we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to maintain our current debt coverage ratios and to pay cash dividends as market conditions change we plan to reevaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity 

  

·   we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 

  

·   capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels in addition we will continue our emphasis on selfdevelopment and ownership of real estate logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investments for 2010 to be in the range of 1921 billion excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately1015 before acquisitions and operational closings we expect to reduce our internal capital plans by approximately 1 billion in total over the next three fiscal years our original internal capital plans projected yearoveryear continued capital expenditure growth we now expect capital expenditures to average under 2 billion a year over the next three years 

  

·   based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 

  

·   we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit agreement 

  

  

·   we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases 

  

·   we expect that our effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 370 

  

·   we expect rent expense as a percentage of total sales and excluding closedstore activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 

  

·   we believe that in 2010 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration productivity improvements shrink warehousing and transportation these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 

  

·   although we are not required to make cash contributions to companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2010 we expect to contribute approximately 110 million to these plans in 2010 we expect any elective contributions made during 2010 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we expect 2010 expense for companysponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately 70 million in addition we expect our cash contributions and expense to the 401k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in 2010 compared to 2009 

  

·   we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to multiemployer pension plans in 2010 subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions  in addition we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multiemployer pension plan contributions over the next five years but we believe it unlikely that contributions will double during that period which is a change from our estimate at yearend 2008 

  

·   we expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our customers through our companybranded credit card in 2010 to be approximately 22 million 

  

·   we believe no additional goodwill impairments will be reasonably possible in 2010 

  

·   we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2010 covering store employees in albuquerque cincinnati dallas detroit ft wayne houston little rock portland seattle and toledo we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters for employees in california and portland upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 

  

various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include 

  

·   the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us 

  

·   if market conditions change it could affect our cash flow 

  

·   our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans 

  

·   the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including persistent deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers 

  

  

·   our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control 

  

·   our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings 

  

·   the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year 

  

·   if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units’ goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized 

  

·   in addition to the factors identified above our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales the effect of our “sister stores” new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 

  

·   our operating margins without fuel could decline more than expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations 

  

·   we could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs 

  

·   we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing kroger and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected outcomes in these matters however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 

  

·   consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable cannot be foreseen 

  

·   rent expense which includes subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy increased store closure activity and future consolidation 

  

·   depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets or the remaining terms of leases use of the straightline method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset writeoffs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed 

  

·   our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 

  

·   the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our 401k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate plan compensation and length of service of participants 

  

·   our contributions and recorded expense related to multiemployer pension funds could increase more than anticipated should asset values in these funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated 

  

·   if weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens our contributions to companysponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated 

  

·   changes in laws or regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

  

·   changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers which could affect sales and earnings 

  

·   changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions including the rate of inflation population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 

  

·   changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin gasoline sales provide a positive effect on oga expense as a percentage of sales 

  

·   our capital expenditures expected square footage growth and number of store projects completed over the next three fiscal years could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen 

  

·   interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment changes in the company’s credit ratings fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt 

  

·   impairment losses including goodwill could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows market values or business valuations in the market our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment real estate market values competitive activity inflation and customer behavior 

  

·   our estimated expense and obligation for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts these assumptions include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 

  

·   adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products or may decrease the customer demand for certain products increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products additionally increases in the cost of inputs such as utility costs or raw material costs could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings 

  

·   although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer 

  

·   earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 

  

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 30 2010 we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 16 billion to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between april 2012 and april 2013 and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of january 30 2010 other longterm assets totaling 26 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately 31 million the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 

  

in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above in 2005 we entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 750 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008 in 2007 we terminated two of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 500 million in 2008 we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of 250 million as of january 30 2010 the unamortized payments and proceeds of 11 million 7 million net of tax on these terminated forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january 30 2010 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january 30 2010 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 30 2010 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january 30 2010 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

   

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases

as of january 31 2009 the company employed approximately 326000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 309 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

during fiscal 2009 the company has major labor contracts to be negotiated covering store employees in albuquerque arizona atlanta dallas dayton denver and portland negotiations in 2009 will be challenging as the company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages affordable health care and increases in company pension contributions due to the recent downturns in the equity markets 

  

s tores 

  

as of january 31 2009 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2481 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 781 of which had fuel centers approximately 43 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they are typically able to earn a return above the company’s cost of capital by drawing customers from a 2 – 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce many combo stores include a fuel center 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry many multidepartment stores include a fuel center 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys many marketplace stores include a fuel center 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

  

in addition to the supermarkets as of january 31 2009 the company operated through subsidiaries 684 convenience stores and 385 fine jewelry stores all of our fine jewelry stores located in malls are operated in leased locations in addition 87 convenience stores were operated through franchise agreements approximately 50 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline

m erchandising and manufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in the company’s merchandising strategy supermarket divisions typically stock approximately 14000 private label items the company’s corporate brand products are produced and sold in three “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the company’s private label items is designed to satisfy our customers’ families with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product the product quality must meet our customers’ expectations in taste and efficacy and we guarantee it kroger value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price

the disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth in item 10 of part iii of this form 10k under the heading “executive officers of the company” and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

c ompetitive environment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition  including our execution of our strategic plan  and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth could also be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

f ood safety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

l abor relations 

  

a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

we are a party to approximately 309 collective bargaining agreements we have major contracts to be negotiated in 2009 covering store employees in albuquerque arizona atlanta dallas dayton denver and portland in negotiations we expect that rising health care and pension costs among other issues will continue to be important topics for negotiation upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a strike could significantly disrupt our operations further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations 

  

s trategy execution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experience through improved service product selection and price successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to identify and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth expectations could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations additionally these systems contain valuable proprietary data that if breached would have an adverse effect on kroger 

  

  

i ndebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2008 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 81 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

l egal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings some of these proceedings including product liability cases could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable for financial reasons or otherwise to satisfy a judgment entered against them others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceedings to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

m ultiemployer pension obligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements the funding status of most of those pension funds has deteriorated and it is probable that the company’s contributions to those funds will increase significantly over the next several years despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would increase kroger’s cost of borrowing 

  

i nsurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency or insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims 

  

c urrent economic conditions 

  

the global economy and financial markets have declined and experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices availability of credit difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors the decline in the housing market diminished market liquidity falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment rates as a result consumers are more cautious this could lead to reduced consumer spending to consumers switching to a less expensive mix of products or to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items all of which could affect our sales growth we are unable to predict when the global economy and financial markets will improve if the global economy and financial markets do not improve our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  in re ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies set by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner has determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition does not qualify as a purchase the company believes that it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it is more likely than not that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the litigation process there can be no assurances that the tax court will rule in favor of the company as of january 31 2009 an adverse decision would require a cash payment of up to approximately 436 million including interest 

  

on february 2 2004 the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court  california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertson’s inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co  united states district court central district of california case no cv040687 alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the “agreement” between the company albertson’s inc and safeway inc collectively the “retailers” which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailers but not the other retailers during the labor dispute in southern california violated section 1 of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may 28 2008 pursuant to a stipulation between the parties the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants as a result of the stipulation and final judgment there are no further claims to be litigated at the trial court level the attorney general has appealed a trial court ruling to the ninth circuit court of appeals and the defendants are appealing a separate ruling although this lawsuit is subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made adequate provisions therefor nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

o ur business 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers as measured by revenue operating 2481 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food 4 less king soopers smith’s fry’s fry’s marketplace dillons qfc and city market of these stores 781 have fuel centers we also operate 771 convenience stores and 385 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 40 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 

  

o ur 2008 performance 

  

by focusing on the customer through our customer 1 st strategy we were able to report solid results for fiscal year 2008 in a particularly tough economy at the beginning of the year we expected to grow supermarket identical sales excluding fuel by 3 to 5 for 2008 supermarket identical sales excluding fuel were 50 meeting the upper end of our original guidance

  

at the outset of fiscal year 2008 kroger’s earnings guidance was a range of 183 to 190 per diluted share our 2008 earnings was 190 per diluted share or 192 per diluted share excluding the effect of a 02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike our 2008 earnings of 192 per diluted share excluding the charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike represents a growth rate of 136 over kroger’s 2007 fullyear earnings of 169 per diluted share we believe that this growth plus kroger’s dividend yield of more than 1 creates a strong return for shareholders 

  

our market share also rose in 2008 based on our internal data and analysis we estimate that our market share increased approximately 61 basis points in 2008 across our 42 major markets we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores this is the fourth consecutive year kroger has achieved significant market share gain over the past four years combined kroger’s market share in our major markets has increased approximately 225 basis points market share is critical to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base we hold the number one or number two market share position in 39 of or our 42 major markets our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share 

  

these market share results demonstrate to us that our longterm strategy is working as population growth continues in the major markets where we operate we intend to continue to grow kroger’s business by maintaining our existing strong market share and by building on additional opportunities for sales growth we estimate that approximately 45 of the share in our major markets — as much as 100 billion — is held by competitors who do not have kroger’s economies of scale our economies of scale allow us to deliver increasing value to customers which is a competitive edge particularly in today’s economic climate 

  

kroger’s business model is structured to produce sustainable earnings per share growth in a variety of economic and competitive conditions primarily through strong identical sales growth we believe this is the right approach to produce sustainable earnings growth over a long period of time we recognize that continual investment in our customer 1 st strategy is necessary to drive strong sustainable identical sales growth we believe that this customer 1 st strategy along with our financial strategies are delivering value to customers shareholders bondholders and our associates and so we remain committed to our plan

  

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2008 compared to 2007 and for 2007 compared to 2006 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 12 billion for 2008 compared to net earnings totaling 12 billion in 2007 and 11 billion in 2006 the increase in our net earnings for 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 resulted from strong nonfuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results in addition 2006 net earnings included a 53 rd week

  

earnings per diluted share totaled 190 or 192 excluding the effect of a 02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike in 2008 compared to 169 per diluted share in 2007 and 154 per diluted share in 2006 earnings per diluted share increased 136 in 2008 excluding the effect of a 02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike compared to 2007 earnings per diluted share increased 15 in 2007 compared to 2006 after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 net earnings in 2006 benefited from a 53 rd week by an estimated 07 per share our earnings per share growth in 2008 2007 and 2006 resulted from increased net earnings strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of kroger stock during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 24 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 637 million during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 53 million shares of our stock for a total investment of 14 billion during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 29 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 633 million

  

sales 

  

total sales 

in millions 

  

   

1   other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores including fuel jewelry stores and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers

  

the growth in our total sales in 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of identical supermarket sales increases increased fuel gallon sales and inflation across most departments identical supermarket sales and total sales excluding fuel increased due to increased transaction count and average transaction size and inflation across all departments after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 total sales increased 82 in 2007 over fiscal 2006 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage annualized identical supermarket sales include all sales at the fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2008 compared to the 52week period of the previous year the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

  

  

identical supermarket sales 

in millions 

  

   

we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations as is the case for identical supermarket sales fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on instore purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below annualized comparable supermarket sales include all fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2008 compared to the same 52week period of the previous year the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

  

comparable supermarket sales 

in millions 

  

   

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the lastin firstout “lifo” charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates were 2320 in 2008 2365 in 2007 and 2427 in 2006 our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased 15 basis points in 2008 20 basis points in 2007 and 26 basis points in 2006 the decrease in our nonfuel fifo gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers in addition fifo gross margin in 2008 compared to 2007 decreased due to high inflation in product costs 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge was 196 million in 2008 154 million in 2007 and 50 million in 2006 like many food retailers we continued to experience product cost inflation in 2008 at levels that have not occurred for several years this increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 in addition product cost inflation in 2007 compared to 2006 caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2007 compared to 2006 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

  

oga expenses as a percent of sales were 1695 in 2008 1731 in 2007 and 1791 in 2006 the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percent of sales excluding fuel decreased 3 basis points in 2008 33 basis points in 2007 and 9 basis points in 2006 the decrease in our oga rate in 2008 excluding the effect of retail fuel operations was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers partially offset by the 25 million charge related to hurricane ike and increases in credit card fees and health care costs the decrease in our oga rate in 2007 excluding the effect of retail fuel operations was primarily the result of strong identical sales growth increased productivity and progress that was made in 2007 in controlling our utility health care and pension costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and expenses recorded for onetime legal reserves our oga rate declined 16 basis points in 2006 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 659 million in 2008 as compared to 644 million in 2007 and 649 million in 2006 rent expense as a percent of sales was 087 in 2008 as compared to 092 in 2007 and 098 in 2006 the decrease in rent expense as a percent of sales reflects our increasing sales and our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation expense was 14 billion in 2008 14 billion in 2007 and 13 billion in 2006 the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling 22 billion in 2008 21 billion in 2007 and 18 billion in 2006 depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales was 190 in 2008 193 in 2007 and 192 in 2006 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 compared to 2007 as a percent of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 compared to 2006 as a percent of sales is due to an annual depreciation charge in both years with 2006 containing 53 weeks of sales due to the structure of our fiscal calendar 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 485 million in 2008 474 million in 2007 and 488 million in 2006 the increase in interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year partially offset by interest income related to the marktomarket of ineffective fair value swaps the decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was the result of replacing borrowings with new borrowings at a lower interest rate the average total debt balance in 2007 was comparable to 2006 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 365 in 2008 354 in 2007 and 362 in 2006 the effective tax rates for those years differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes in addition the effective tax rate for 2007 differs from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues the effective rate in 2006 includes an adjustment of some deferred tax balances 

  

during the third quarter of 2007 we resolved favorably some outstanding tax issues this resulted in a 2007 tax benefit of approximately 40 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 19 

  

in 2006 during the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances and after the filing of our annual federal and state tax returns we identified adjustments to be made in prior years’ deferred tax reconciliation we corrected these deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 which resulted in a reduction of our fiscal 2006 provision for income tax expense of approximately 21 million and reduced the rate by 12 we do not believe these adjustments are material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 or to any prior years’ consolidated financial statements as a result we have not restated any prior year amounts

we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases totaling 448 million in 2008 12 billion in 2007 and 374 million in 2006 under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 189 million in 2008 270 million in 2007 and 259 million in 2006 under the stock option programs 

  

in 2008 to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

c apital expenditures 

  

capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions totaled 22 billion in 2008 compared to 21 billion in 2007 and 18 billion in 2006 the increase in capital spending in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 was the result of increasing our focus on remodels merchandising and productivity projects the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage

c ritical accounting policies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 31 2009 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 4 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 26 million in 2008 24 million in 2007 and 61 million in 2006 we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

we review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events we perform reviews at the operating division level generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units we would need to recognize an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

a companysponsored defined benefit pension plans 

  

we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statements no 87 99 106 and 132r sfas 158 which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized we adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 effective february 3 2008 the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december 31 measurement date all plans are now measured as of our fiscal year end the noncash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 decreased shareowners’ equity by approximately 5 million 3 million aftertax and increased longterm liabilities by approximately 5 million there was no effect on our results of operations 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

  

the objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of yearend 2008 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be “settled” theoretically by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 700 discount rate as of yearend 2008 represents the equivalent single rate under a broadmarket aa yield curve constructed by an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 650 for yearend 2007 the 50 basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 31 2009 by approximately 147 million 

  

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for 2008 and 2007 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average return was 41 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2008 net of all investment management fees and expenses primarily due to the poor performance of the financial markets in 2008 the value of all investments in our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december 31 2008 net of investment management fees and expenses declined 261 we believe our 85 pension return assumption is appropriate because we expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performances as the very longterm historical average annual return for example the sp 500 index has returned 84 annually on a compound basis for the 20 years ending december 31 2008 for the various markets in which the plan invests we have been advised that during 2009 the trustees plan to increase the allocation of noncore assets including high yield debt securities commodities and real estate collectively these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets the trustees have advised us that they expect these changes will have little effect on the total portfolio risk but will increase the likelihood of achieving the 85 expected rate of return see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 20 million in 2008 52 million in 2007 and 150 million in 2006 to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans although kroger is not required to make cash contributions to its companysponsored defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2009 we made a 200 million cash contribution on february 2 2009 additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any voluntary contributions made during 2009 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  

net periodic benefit cost decreased in 2008 and 2007 compared to 2006 due to participants in the cash balance formula of the consolidated retirement benefit plan being moved to a defined contribution 401k retirement savings account plan effective january 1 2007 participants under that formula continue to earn interest on prior contributions but no additional pay credits will be earned the 401k retirement savings plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from kroger based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service we contributed and expensed 92 million in 2008 and 90 million in 2007 to employee 401k retirement savings accounts 

  

b multiemployer plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 219 million in 2008 207 million in 2007 and 204 million in 2006 

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2008 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer as of december 31 2008 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 30 billion pretax or 19 billion aftertax this represents an increase in the amount of underfunding estimated as of december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the recent market downturn our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2008 our contributions to these plans increased approximately 6 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6 since 2004 we do not expect a significant increase in our contributions to multiemployer pension plans in 2009 compared to 2008 subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions we believe our contributions to multiemployer pension plans could as much as double over the next several years after 2009 to reduce this underfunding finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multiemployer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a marketbased framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 fasb staff position fsp 1572 partial deferral of the effective date of statement no 157 fsp 1572 deferred the effective date of sfas 157 for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 effective february 3 2008 we adopted sfas 157 except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities which are deferred until february 1 2009 by fsp 1572 

  

  

sfas 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value the three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by sfas 157 are as follows 

  

level 1 — quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

  

level 2 — pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1 which are either directly or indirectly observable 

  

level 3 — unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 

  

for those financial instruments carried at fair value in the consolidated financial statements the following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments at january 31 2009

variable interest entities 

  

in december 2008 the fasb issued fas 1404 and fin 46r8 disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fas 1404 and fin 46r8   fas 1404 and fin 46r8 require additional disclosures about an entity’s involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets effective january 31 2009 we adopted fas 1404 and fin 46r8 

  

in the first quarter of 2008 we made an investment in the little clinic llc “tlc” tlc operates supermarket walkin medical clinics in seven states primarily in the midwest and southeast at the date of investment tlc was determined to be a variableinterest entity “vie” under fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46r with kroger being the primary beneficiary we were deemed the primary beneficiary due to our current ownership interest and half of our written put options being at a floor price as a result we consolidated tlc in accordance with fin 46r the minority interest was recorded at fair value on the acquisition date the fair value of tlc was determined based on the amount of the investment made by kroger and the percentage acquired our assessment of goodwill represents the excess of this amount over the fair value of tlc’s net assets as of the investment date creditors of tlc have no recourse to the general credit of kroger conversely creditors of kroger have no recourse to the assets of tlc in addition if requested by tlc’s board of directors by january 1 2010 we have agreed to make a pro rata portion of an additional capital contribution 

  

  

the table below shows the unaudited amounts of assets and liabilities from tlc included in our consolidated results after eliminating intercompany items as of january 31 2009 in millions of dollars 

  

   

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we became the primary beneficiary of iwireless llc a vie in which we have a 25 ownership interest we were deemed the primary beneficiary due to our current ownership interest 25 million line of credit guarantee and 8 million loan to iwireless llc we became the primary beneficiary in the fourth quarter of 2008 under fin 46r after lending 8 million to iwireless llc iwireless llc sells prepaid phones primarily in our stores the minority interest was recorded at fair value the fair value of iwireless llc was determined based on the amount of the investment made by kroger in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the percentage acquired our assessment of goodwill represents the excess of this amount over the fair value of iwireless llc net assets as of the date of the loan we have guaranteed the indebtedness of iwireless llc up to 25 million which is collateralized by 8 million of inventory located in our stores the creditors of kroger have no recourse to the assets of iwireless llc 

  

the table below shows the preliminary and unaudited amounts of assets and liabilities from iwireless llc included in our consolidated results after eliminating intercompany items as of january 31 2009 in millions of dollars 

  

   

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r  under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted after january 29 2006 as well as all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 29 2006 in accordance with sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we account for restricted stock awards under sfas 123r we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the awards lapse 

  

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 98 in 2008 and 97 in 2007 of inventories were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 800 million at january 31 2009 and by 604 million at february 2 2008 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 35 billion in 2008 36 billion in 2007 and 33 billion in 2006 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized more than 85 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 29 billion of cash from operations in 2008 compared to 26 billion in 2007 and 24 billion in 2006 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to strong operating results adjusted for noncash expenses in addition changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affected the amount of cash provided by our operating activities we realized decreases in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 411 million in 2008 164 million in 2007 and 129 million in 2006 the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in forward inventory buying activity these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling 20 million in 2008 52 million in 2007 and 150 in 2006 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 22 billion in 2008 compared to 22 billion in 2007 and 16 billion in 2006 our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in 2008 compared to 2007 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to higher capital spending and payments for two acquisitions capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 22 billion in 2008 21 billion in 2007 and 18 billion in 2006 refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 769 million of cash in 2008 compared to 310 million in 2007 and 785 million in 2006 the increase in the amount of cash used in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily a result of payments on long termdebt and the bank revolver offset by decreased stock repurchases the decrease in the amount of cash used in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily a result of proceeds received from the issuance of long termdebt offset by greater stock repurchases and dividends paid we repurchased 637 million of kroger stock in 2008 compared to 14 billion in 2007 and 633 million in 2006 we paid dividends totaling 227 million in 2008 202 million in 2007and 140 million in 2006 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and financing obligations decreased 59 million to 81 billion as of yearend 2008 from 81 billion as of yearend 2007 the slight decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from the issuance of 400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 500 375 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 690 and 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 750 offset by decreased commercial paper the payments on the bank revolver the repayment of 200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6375 and 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 745 that came due in 2008 total debt increased to 81 billion as of yearend 2007 from 71 billion as of yearend 2006 the increases in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the issuance of 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 64 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 615 and borrowings under the bank credit facility in 2007 offset by the repayment of 200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 765 and 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 780 that came due in 2007 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million in each of the three years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 45 million in 2008 and 44 million in 2007 

  

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 250 million under our f2p2a3 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility we have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa2bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 

  

our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

·   our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense as defined in the credit facility was 859 to 1 as of january 31 2009 our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our applicable percentage ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility

  

·   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 202 to 1 as of january 31 2009 if this ratio exceeded 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired

  

·   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 412 to 1 as of january 31 2009 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired

  

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2008 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january 31 2009 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 31 2009 we maintained a 25 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates in 2011 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling 75 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january 31 2009 we had no borrowings under our credit agreement and net outstanding commercial paper of 90 million that reduced amounts available under our credit agreement in addition as of january 31 2009 we had borrowings under our money market lines totaling 39 million the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled 337 million as of january 31 2009 

  

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 31 2009 we had authorized for issuance 14 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 20 2007 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of our subsidiaries see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have 50 ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 31 2009 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also agreed to guarantee up to 25 million the indebtedness of an entity of which we have 25 ownership interest our share of the responsibility as of january 31 2009 should the entity be unable to meet its obligations totals approximately 25 million and is collateralized by approximately 8 million of inventory located in our stores in addition we have guaranteed half of the lease payments of a location leased by an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest the net present value of the guaranteed rental payments is approximately 6 million 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 31 2009 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value or cash flow hedges 

  

in 2008 we terminated nine fair value interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 900 million three of these terminated interest rate swaps were purchased and became ineffective fair value hedges in 2008 the proceeds received at termination were credited to interest expense in the amount of 15 million we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately 45 million the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 

  

in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above in 2005 we entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 750 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008 in 2007 we terminated two of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 500 million in 2008 we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of 250 million the unamortized payments and proceeds on these terminated forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made as of february 2 2008 other longterm liabilities totaling 18 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the table below provides information about our underlying debt portfolio as of january 31 2009 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases as of january 31 2009 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each variable rate debt is based on the us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 31 2009 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments as of january 31 2009 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements 

  

   

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases 

  

some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so as of january 31 2009 we maintained a derivative instrument to manage exposure to changes in corrugated cardboard prices this derivative has a threeyear term the instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended accordingly the change in the fair value of this instrument is markedtomarket in our consolidated statements of operations in oga expenses as of january 31 2009 the fair value of this instrument was insignificant

the company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its stores the company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to its customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses 

  

e mployees 

  

the company employs approximately 323000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 330 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  

during fiscal 2008 the company has major labor contracts covering its store employees expiring in columbus indianapolis las vegas louisville nashville phoenix and portland negotiations in 2008 will be challenging as the company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care 

  

s tores 

  

as of february 2 2008 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2486 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 696 of which had fuel centers approximately 43 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses 

  

the combo stores are the primary food store format they are typically able to earn a return above the company’s cost of capital by drawing customers from a 2 – 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce many combo stores include a fuel center 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry many multidepartment stores include a fuel center 

  

marketplace stores are smaller in size than multidepartment stores they offer fullservice grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys many marketplace stores include a fuel center 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

  

in addition to supermarkets the company operates either directly or through subsidiaries 782 convenience stores and 394 fine jewelry stores substantially all of our fine jewelry stores are operated in leased locations subsidiaries operated 691of the convenience stores while 91 were operated through franchise agreements approximately 50 of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

  

c ompetitive e nvironment 

  

the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition  including our execution of our strategic plan  and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability our profitability and growth could also be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending 

  

f ood s afety 

  

customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products sold by kroger could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

  

l abor r elations 

  

a significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

we are a party to approximately 330 collective bargaining agreements we have major contracts expiring in 2008 covering store employees in columbus indianapolis las vegas louisville nashville phoenix and portland in future negotiations with labor unions we expect that rising health care pension and employee benefit costs among other issues will continue to be important topics for negotiation upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions this could significantly disrupt our operations further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations 

  

s trategy e xecution 

  

our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experience through enhanced service product selection and value successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to identify and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth expectations could be adversely affected 

  

data and technology 

  

our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations additionally these systems contain valuable proprietary data that if breached would have an adverse effect on kroger 

  

  

i ndebtedness 

  

as of yearend 2007 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 81 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

  

l egal p roceedings 

  

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings some of these proceedings including product liability cases could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable for financial reasons or otherwise to satisfy a judgment entered against them others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceedings to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

  

m ulti e mployer p ost r etirement o bligations 

  

as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements in addition to future contribution obligations that kroger may have under those plans there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on the company’s debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would increase kroger’s cost of borrowing 

  

i nsurance 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims

 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  in re ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies set by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner has determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition does not qualify as a purchase the company believes that it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it is more likely than not that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the litigation process there can be no assurances that the tax court will rule in favor of the company as of february 2 2008 an adverse decision would require a cash payment of approximately 419 million including interest 

  

on february 2 2004 the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court  california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertson’s inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co  united states district court central district of california case no cv040687 alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the “agreement” between the company albertson’s inc and safeway inc collectively the “retailers” which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailers but not the other retailers during the labor dispute in southern california violated section 1 of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may 25 2005 the court denied a motion for a summary judgment filed by the defendants ralphs and the other defendants filed a notice of an interlocutory appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on november 29 2005 the appellate court dismissed the appeal on december 7 2006 the court denied a motion for summary judgment filed by the state of california the company continues to believe it has strong defenses against this lawsuit and is vigorously defending it although this lawsuit is subject to uncertainties inherent to the litigation process based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position 

  

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made adequate provisions therefor nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

o ur b usiness 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers operating 2486 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food 4 less king soopers smith’s fry’s fry’s marketplace dillons qfc and city market of these stores 696 have fuel centers we also operate 782 convenience stores and 394 fine jewelry stores 

  

kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 43 of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 

  

o ur 2007 p erformance 

  

2007 was a great year for kroger once again our actual results compare very favorably to our expectations for the year 

  

at the outset of fiscal 2007 we expected to grow identical sales excluding fuel by 3 to 5 we achieved identical sales excluding fuel of 53 for fiscal year 2007 exceeding the upper end of our original guidance we are particularly pleased with such strong identical sales growth in a challenging economic environment and we believe this demonstrates the resiliency of our business model 

  

kroger’s initial guidance for fiscal 2007 earnings was a range of 160 to 165 per diluted share our 2007 earnings were 169 per diluted share also exceeding the upper end of our original guidance this equates to 15 growth after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 this growth plus kroger’s dividend yield of slightly more than 1 created strong value for shareholders 

  

kroger’s business model is structured to produce sustainable earnings per share growth in a variety of economic and competitive conditions primarily through strong identical sales growth we recognize that continual investment in our customers’ shopping experience is necessary to drive strong sustainable identical sales growth and we have the operating cost structure that allows us to afford those pricing and service investments we believe that kroger’s dividend program and the sustainable earnings per share growth created by strong identical sales slight operating margin improvement and continued share repurchases is a solid approach to increasing shareholder value 

  

while the objective of our business model is to create shareholder value the objective of kroger’s customer 1 st strategy is to serve customers our customer 1 st strategy and business model work in tandem to build our successful business 

  

kroger has several advantages that allow us to grow our business in a competitive industry our strong market share and geographic diversity are among the most important kroger serves customers in 44 major markets across 31 different states we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores our broad geographical diversity enables us to withstand competitive pressures in multiple markets and to manage unusual economic challenges economic conditions can affect our business but our customer 1 st strategy and business model allow us to provide a strong value proposition to customers whose spending may be pinched by economic pressures 

  

market share is critical to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base we hold the number one or number two share position in 39 of our 44 major markets our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share 

  

during fiscal 2007 we grew our market share by roughly 65 basis points in our 44 major markets based on our internal data and analysis this was on top of very strong growth in 2005 and 2006 during the last three fiscal years combined kroger’s share has increased approximately 165 basis points across our major markets 

  

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2007 compared to 2006 and for 2006 compared to 2005 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 1181 million for 2007 compared to net earnings totaling 1115 and 958 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in our net earnings for 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 resulted from spreading fixed costs over our increased identical sales in addition 2006 net earnings compared to 2005 increased due to a 53 rd week in that year 

  

earnings per diluted share totaled 169 in 2007 compared to 154 and 131 per share in 2006 and 2005 respectively earnings per diluted share increased 15 after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 net earnings in 2006 benefited from a 53 rd week by an estimated 007 per share our earnings per share growth in 2007 2006 and 2005 resulted from increased net earnings strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of kroger stock during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 53 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 1421 million during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 29 million shares of our stock for a total investment of 633 million during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 15 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 252 million 

  

sales 

  

total sales 

in millions 

  

   

1 other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores including fuel jewelry stores and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 

  

the growth in our total sales was primarily the result of identical store sales increases and inflation in many core grocery and perishable categories increased transaction count and average transaction size were both responsible for our increases in identical supermarket sales excluding retail fuel operations after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 total sales increased 82 in 2007 over fiscal 2006 

  

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage annualized identical supermarket sales include all sales at the fred meyer multidepartment stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2007 compared to the same 52week period of the previous year the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

  

identical supermarket sales

we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations annualized comparable supermarket sales include all fred meyer multidepartments we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 52week period of 2007 compared to the same 52week period of the previous year the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

  

comparable supermarket sales

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus lastin firstout “lifo” charge credit merchandise costs include advertising warehousing and transportation but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates were 2365 2427 and 2480 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively retail fuel sales lowered our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased 20 basis points 26 basis points and 4 basis points in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in our nonfuel fifo gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers 

  

lifo charge 

  

the lifo charge in 2007 2006 and 2005 was 154 million 50 million and 27 million respectively like many food retailers we continue to experience product cost inflation at levels that have not occurred for several years we estimate that product cost inflation was approximately 3 to 35 throughout 2007 as compared to estimated inflation rates that averaged approximately 1 over the previous two years this increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in 2007 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs among other items rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  

oga expenses as a percent of sales were 1731 1791 and 1821 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales oga expenses as a percent of sales excluding fuel decreased 33 basis points 9 basis points and 13 basis points in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and expenses recorded for legal reserves our oga rate declined 16 basis points in 2006 the decrease in our oga rate in 2007 excluding the effect of retail fuel operations was primarily the result of strong identical sales growth increased productivity and progress we have made in controlling our utility health care and pension costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees 

  

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense was 644 million in 2007 as compared to 649 million and 661 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively rent expense as a percent of sales was 092 in 2007 as compared to 098 in 2006 and 109 in 2005 the decrease in rent expense as a percent of sales reflects our increasing sales and our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible 

  

depreciation and amortization expense 

  

depreciation expense was 1356 million 1272 million and 1265 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling 2060 million 1777 million and 1306 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales was 193 192 and 209 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense compared to 2006 as a percent of sales is due to an annual depreciation charge in both years with 2006 containing 53 weeks of sales due to the structure of our fiscal calendar excluding the effect of retail fuel operations the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense compared to 2005 as a percent of sales is primarily the result of identical store sales increases 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 474 million 488 million and 510 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in interest expense was the result of replacing borrowings with new borrowings at a lower interest rate the average total debt balance in 2007 was comparable to both 2006 and 2005 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 354 362 and 372 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differ from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of certain tax issues and an adjustment of certain deferred tax balances respectively in addition the effective income tax rates differ from the expected federal statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 

  

during the third quarter of 2007 we resolved favorably certain tax issues this resulted in a 2007 tax benefit of approximately 40 million and reduced our effective rate by 19 

  

in 2006 during the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances and after the filing of our annual federal and state tax returns we identified adjustments to be made in the previous years’ deferred tax reconciliation we corrected these deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 which resulted in a reduction of our fiscal 2006 provision for income tax expense of approximately 21 million and reduced the rate by 12 we do not believe these adjustments are material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 or to any prior years’ consolidated financial statements as a result we have not restated any prior year amounts 

  

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  

we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule 10b51 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases totaling 1151 million 374 million and 239 million under these repurchase programs during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition to these repurchase programs in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 270 million 259 million and 13 million under the stock option program during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

  

c apital e xpenditures 

  

capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions totaled 2060 million in 2007 compared to 1777 million in 2006 and 1306 million in 2005 the increase in capital spending in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 was the result of increasing our focus on remodels merchandising and productivity projects the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february 2 2008 we establish case reserves for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 

  

for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 3 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  

we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling 24 million 61 million and 48 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill 

  

we review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events we perform reviews at the operating division level generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units we would need to recognize an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  

intangible assets 

  

in addition to goodwill we have recorded intangible assets totaling 32 million 24 million and 34 million for leasehold equities liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases respectively at february 2 2008 balances at february 3 2007 were 26 million 22 million and 28 million for lease equities liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription files respectively we amortize leasehold equities over the remaining life of the lease we do not amortize owned liquor licenses however we amortize liquor licenses that must be renewed over their useful lives we amortize pharmacy prescription file purchases over seven years we consider these assets annually during our testing for impairment 

  

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  

postretirement benefit plans 

  

a companysponsored pension plans 

  

we account for our pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statements no 87 99 106 and 132r  which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized we currently use a december 31 measurement date effective for 2008 the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position we will adopt the measurement date change in fiscal 2008 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 14 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of yearend 2007 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be “settled” theoretically by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 650 discount rate as of yearend 2007 represents the equivalent single rate under a broadmarket aa yield curve constructed by an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of 590 for yearend 2006 the 60 basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 2 2008 by approximately 184 million 

  

  

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for 2007 and 2006 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average return was 85 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2007 net of all investment management fees and expenses our actual return for the pension plan calendar year ending december 31 2007 on that same basis was 95 we believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return we have been advised that during 2008 the trustees plan to increase the allocation of noncore assets including high yield debt securities commodities hedge funds and real estate from 42 to 52 the trustees have also indicated that they plan to increase hedge funds within these sectors from 17 to 22 to augment risk and return collectively these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets the trustees have advised us that they expect these changes will have little effect on the total return but will reduce the expected volatility of the return see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  

sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

  

   

we contributed 52 million and 150 million to our companysponsored pension plans in 2007 and 2006 respectively although we are not required to make cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans during fiscal 2008 contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any elective contributions made during 2008 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  

net periodic benefit cost decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 due to participants in the cash balance formula of the consolidated retirement benefit plan being moved to a 401k retirement savings account plan effective january 1 2007 participants under that formula continue to earn interest on prior contributions but no additional pay credits will be earned the 401k retirement savings plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from kroger based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service we contributed and expensed 90 million to employee 401k retirement savings accounts in 2007 

  

b multiemployer plans 

  

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 207 million in 2007 204 million in 2006 and 196 million in 2005 

  

  

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2007 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding as of december 31 2007 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 500 million to 700 million pretax or 315 million to 440 million aftertax this represents a decrease in the amount of underfunding estimated as of december 31 2006 this decrease is attributable to among other things the investment returns on assets held in trust for the plans during 2007 our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 

  

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in 2007 our contributions to these plans increased approximately 1 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 5 since 2004 we expect our contributions to remain consistent subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions the projected contribution amounts in 2008 and beyond has been favorably affected by significant improvement in the values of assets held in trusts by the labor agreements negotiated in recent years and by related trustee actions although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers increased contributions or benefit reductions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered our estimate contemplates neither increased contributions or reduced benefits finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  

  

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding would increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  

deferred rent 

  

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

effective february 4 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin no 48” which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition 

  

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an allowance is audited and fully resolved as of february 2 2008 the internal revenue service has concluded an examination for tax years 2002 through 2004 

  

the assessment of our uncertain tax positions relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results could differ resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our consolidated statements of operations 

  

  

to the extent that we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

  

we account for sharebased compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment   under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted on or after january 29 2006 as well as all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 29 2006 in accordance with sfas no 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award prior to january 29 2006 we applied apb no 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and provided the proforma disclosures required by sfas no 123 apb no 25 provided for recognition of compensation expense for employee stock awards based on the intrinsic value of the award on the grant date 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 and 98 of inventories for 2007 and 2006 respectively were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 604 million at february 2 2008 and by 450 million at february 3 2007 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

we follow itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  

vendor allowances 

  

we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately 36 billion 33 billion and 32 billion of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we recognized more than 85 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 2581 million of cash from operations in 2007 compared to 2351 million in 2006 and 2192 million in 2005 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to strong operating results adjusted for noncash expenses in addition changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the amount of cash provided by our operating activities we realized a 163 million 129 million and 121 million decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in forward inventory buying activity these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans totaling 52 million in 2007 150 million in 2006 and 300 million in 2005 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2007 was higher than the amounts paid in 2006 and 2005 due to higher net earnings 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 2218 million in 2007 compared to 1587 million in 2006 and 1279 million in 2005 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 due primarily to higher capital spending and payments for two acquisitions capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 2060 million 1777 million and 1306 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 310 million of cash in 2007 compared to 785 million in 2006 and 847 million in 2005 the decrease in the amount of cash used was primarily a result of proceeds received from the issuance of long termdebt offset by greater stock repurchases and dividends paid we repurchased 1421 million of kroger stock in 2007 compared to 633 million in 2006 and 252 million in 2005 we paid dividends totaling 202 million in 2007 compared to 140 million in 2006 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and financing obligations increased 1062 million to 81 billion as of yearend 2007 from 71 billion as of yearend 2006 total debt decreased 173 million to 71 billion as of yearend 2006 from 72 billion as of yearend 2005 the increases in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the issuance of 600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 64 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 615 and borrowings under the bank credit facility in 2007 offset by the repayment of 200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 765 and 300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 780 that came due in 2007 the decreases in 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2007 2006 and 2005 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 44 million and 18 million as of yearend 2007 and 2006 

  

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 250 million under our f2p2a3 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility we have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa2bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 

  

our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

   

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2007 

  

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 2 2008 in millions of dollars 

  

   

1   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately 76 million in 2007 this table also excludes contributions under various multiemployer pension plans which totaled 207 million in 2007 

  

2   we adopted fin 48 on february 4 2007 see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the adoption of fin 48 the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 

  

3   amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february 2 2008 applicable to our variable interest debt instruments excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the shortterm nature of these borrowings and stated fixed and swapped interest rates for all other debt instruments 

  

4   the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for selfinsurance liability have been stated on a present value basis 

  

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of february 2 2008 we maintained a 25 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates in 2011 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained four money market lines totaling 125 million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of february 2 2008 we had net outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under our credit agreement totaling 345 and 225 million respectively that reduced amounts available under our credit agreement and had no borrowings under the money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit agreement totaled 355 million as of february 2 2008 

  

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 2 2008 we had available for issuance 1250 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december 20 2007 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of our subsidiaries see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have 50 membership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february 2 2008 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also agreed to guarantee up to 10 million the indebtedness of an entity of which we have 25 membership interest the guarantee is collateralized by inventory of the entity our share of the responsibility as of february 2 2008 should the entity be unable to meet its obligations totals approximately 9 million and is collateralized by 8 million of inventory located in our stores 

  

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 

  

in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

effective february 4 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin no 48” which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition 

  

the effect of adoption was to increase retained earnings by 4 million and to decrease our accrual for uncertain tax positions by a corresponding amount additionally we decreased goodwill and accrual for uncertain tax positions by 72 million to reflect the measurement under the rules of fin no 48 of an uncertain tax position related to previous business combinations 

  

as of adoption the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including positions affecting only the timing of tax benefits was 694 million the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate was 119 million 

  

to the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax such amounts have been accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations this accounting policy election is a continuation of our historical policy as of february 4 2007 the amount of accrued interest and penalties included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets was 118 million 

  

  

the irs concluded a field examination of our 2002 – 2004 us tax returns during the third quarter of 2007 an examination of our 1999 – 2001 us tax returns was completed in 2005 we contested two issues at the appellate level of the irs one of the issues was resolved in the third quarter of 2007 and we anticipate that the remaining issue may be resolved within the next 12 months in the opinion of management the ultimate disposition of the item noted above will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations additionally we have a case in the us tax court a decision on this case is not expected within the next 12 months in connection with this case we have extended the statute of limitations on our tax years after 1991 

  

as a result of settlements with taxing authorities during the third quarter we reclassified unrecognized tax benefits of 168 million from other longterm liabilities to deferred income taxes and accrued taxes payable 

  

effective february 3 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statement no 87 99 106 and 132r which requires the recognition of the funded status of its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” we currently use a december 31 measurement date effective for 2008 the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position we will adopt the measurement date change in fiscal 2008 

  

effective january 29 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment using the modifiedprospective method under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 29 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation   for all sharebased awards granted on or after january 29 2006 we recognize compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 2 2008 we maintained six interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 1050 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between march 2008 and january 2015 the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of february 2 2008 other longterm assets totaling 11 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  

in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above in 2005 the company entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 750 million in 2007 the company terminated two of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in a notional amount of 500 million a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time the company entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008 the unamortized payment and proceeds on the two terminated forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedges relate are made the one remaining forwardstarting interest rate swap as of february 2 2008 has a tenyear term with a fixed interest rate of 511 as of february 2 2008 other longterm liabilities totaling 18 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of this agreement 

  

during 2003 we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that we accounted for as fair value hedges we recorded approximately 114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and they are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt as of february 2 2008 the unamortized balances totaled approximately 33 million 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february 2 2008 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february 2 2008 interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2 2008 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february 2 2008 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

   

   

we expect the average pay rate for 2008 to decline from the table above by 40 to 50 basis points due to the recent federal reserve interest rate cuts in march 2008 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores warehouses manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases 

  

some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so as of february 2 2008 we maintained three derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in corrugated cardboard prices these derivatives contain a threeyear term the instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended accordingly changes in the fair value of these instruments are markedtomarket in our consolidated statements of operations in oga expenses as of february 2 2008 an accrued liability totaling 1 million had been recorded to reflect the fair value of these instruments

e mployees 

  the company employs approximately 310000 full and parttime employees a majority of the company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately 320 such agreements usually with terms of three to five years 

  during fiscal 2007 the company has major labor contracts expiring in southern california cincinnati detroit houston memphis toledo seattle and west virginia negotiations in 2007 will be challenging as the company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care 

s tores 

  as of february 3 2007 the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries 2468 supermarkets and multidepartment stores 631 of which had fuel centers approximately 39 of these supermarkets were operated in companyowned facilities including some companyowned buildings on leased land the company’s current strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate the company’s stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores price impact warehouses or marketplace stores 

  the combo stores are the primary food store format they are typically able to earn a return above the company’s cost of capital by drawing customers from a 2 – 2½ mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and highquality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce many combo stores include a fuel center 

  multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive toys and fine jewelry many multidepartment stores include a fuel center 

  price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store

 item 1a   risk factors 

  there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business the significant risk factors are discussed below please also see the “outlook” section in item 7 of this form 10k for forwardlooking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations 

c ompetitive e nvironment 

  the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats entry of nontraditional competitors and market consolidation additionally consumers are increasingly looking to restaurants to fulfill their food product needs we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wideranging needs and expectations of our customers however the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition  including our execution of our strategic plan  and our response to these competitive actions can adversely affect our profitability 

f ood s afety 

  customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products concerns regarding the safety of food products sold by kroger could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger regardless of the cause could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations 

l abor r elations 

  a significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions and our relationship with those unions including any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  we are a party to approximately 320 collective bargaining agreements we have major contracts expiring in 2007 in southern california cincinnati detroit houston memphis toledo seattle and west virginia in future negotiations with labor unions we expect that rising health care pension and employee benefit costs among other issues will continue to be important topics for negotiation upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions this could significantly disrupt our operations further if we are unable to control health care pension and wage costs or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations 

s trategy e xecution 

  our strategy focuses on improving our customers’ shopping experience through enhanced service product selection and value successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth maintaining this strategy requires the ability to identify and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customerfocused programs as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required if we are unable to execute our plans or if our plans fail to meet our customers’ expectations our sales and earnings growth expectations could be adversely affected 

d ata and t echnology 

  our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations additionally these systems contain valuable proprietary data that if breached would have an adverse effect on kroger 

i ndebtedness 

  as of yearend 2006 kroger’s outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and financing obligations totaled approximately 71 billion this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness changes in our credit ratings or in the interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure 

l egal p roceedings 

  from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury antitrust claims and other proceedings some of these proceedings including product liability cases could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable for financial reasons or otherwise to satisfy a judgment entered against them others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceedings to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results please also refer to the “legal proceedings” section in item 3 below 

m ulti e mployer p ost r etirement o bligations 

  as discussed in more detail below in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationcritical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans ” kroger contributes to several multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements in addition to future contribution obligations that kroger may have under those plans there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger’s outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on the company’s debt securities any downgrading of kroger’s debt ratings likely would increase kroger’s cost of borrowing 

i nsurance 

  we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee health care benefits any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims

 item 2   properties 

  as of february 3 2007 the company operated more than 3500 owned or leased supermarkets convenience stores fine jewelry stores distribution warehouses and food processing facilities through divisions subsidiaries or affiliates these facilities are located throughout the united states a majority of the properties used to conduct the company’s business are leased 

  the company generally owns store equipment fixtures and leasehold improvements as well as processing and manufacturing equipment the total cost of the company’s owned assets and capitalized leases at february 3 2007 was 20982 million while the accumulated depreciation was 9203 million 

  leased premises generally have base terms ranging from tentotwenty years with renewal options for additional periods some options provide the right to purchase the property after conclusion of the lease term store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume rentals for the distribution processing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts for additional information on lease obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  on october 6 2006 the company petitioned the tax court  in re ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc docket no 2036406  for a redetermination of deficiencies set by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a 1992 transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code the commissioner has determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section 338h3 of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition does not qualify as a purchase the company has strong arguments in favor of its position but due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the litigation process an adverse decision that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results is a possible outcome as of february 3 2007 an adverse decision would require a cash payment of approximately 363 million including interest 

  on february 2 2004 the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court  california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertson’s inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co  united states district court central district of california case no cv040687 alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the “agreement” between the company albertson’s inc and safeway inc collectively the “retailers” which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailers but not the other retailers during the labor dispute in southern california violated section 1 of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may 25 2005 the court denied a motion for a summary judgment filed by the defendants ralphs and the other defendants filed a notice of an interlocutory appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on november 29 2005 the appellate court dismissed the appeal on december 7 2006 the court denied a motion for summary judgment filed by the state of california the company continues to believe it has strong defenses against this lawsuit and is vigorously defending it although this lawsuit is subject to uncertainties inherent to the litigation process based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  ralphs grocery company is the defendant in a group of civil actions initially filed in 2003 and for which a coordination order was issued on january 20 2004 in the great escape promotion cases pending in the superior court of california county of los angeles case no jccp no 4343 the plaintiffs allege that ralphs violated various laws protecting consumers in connection with a promotion pursuant to which ralphs offered travel awards to customers on february 22 2006 the court in the great escape promotion cases issued an order granting preliminary approval of the class action settlement notice of the class action settlement was sent to class members and the court issued an order finally approving the class action settlement on august 25 2006 the settlement involved the issuance of coupons and gift cards while the ultimate cost of the settlement to ralphs is largely dependent on the rate of coupon redemption management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  on august 12 2000 ralphs grocery company along with several other potentially responsible parties entered into a consent decree with the u s environmental protection agency surrounding the purported release of volatile organic compounds in connection with industrial operations at a property located in los angeles california the consent decree followed the epa’s earlier administrative order no 9718 in which the epa sought remedial action pursuant to its authority under the comprehensive environmental remediation compensation and liability act under the consent decree ralphs contributes a share of the costs associated with groundwater extraction and treatment which share currently totals approximately 3000040000 per year the treatment process is expected to continue until at least 2012 

  various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions andor seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position 

  the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made adequate provisions therefor nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite management’s current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend o ur b usiness 

  the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers operating 2468 supermarket and multidepartment stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food 4 less king soopers smith’s fry’s fry’s marketplace dillons qfc and city market of these stores 631 had fuel centers we also operate 779 convenience stores and 412 fine jewelry stores 

  kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately 55 of the corporate brand units sold in the company’s retail outlets 

  our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 

o ur 2006 p erformance 

  the continued focus of our associates on delivering improved service product selection and value to our customers generated a year of significantly improved identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales in 2006 our identical supermarket sales excluding fuel sales grew at 56 in 2006 these results followed strong 2005 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel sales of 35 in 2005 and 08 in 2004 

  increasing market share helped us achieve our results our internal analysis shows that we hold the 1 or 2 market share position in 38 of our 44 major markets we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores our share increased in 36 of these 44 major markets declined in seven and remained unchanged in one on a volumeweighted basis our overall market share in these 44 major markets increased approximately 65 basis points during 2006 

  we compete against a total of 1262 supercenters an increase of 133 over 2005 there are 34 major markets in which supercenters have achieved at least a 3 market share position our overall market share in these 34 major markets on a volumeweighted basis increased over 70 basis points during 2006 our market share increased in 27 of these 34 major markets declined in six and remained unchanged in one 

  all of the market share estimates described above are based on our internal data and analysis we believe they are reliable but can provide no other assurance of reliability we believe this market share analysis illustrates that kroger continued to achieve significant growth in 2006 even in the face of aggressive expansion in the supermarket industry by supercenters intense price competition increasing fragmentation of retail formats and market consolidation our retail price investments combined with our service and selling initiatives led to these market share gains in 2006 we believe there is still significant room for growth in our 44 major markets we estimate approximately 47 of the share in those markets continues to be held by competitors without our economies of scale 

  we were able to balance our sales growth with earnings growth our net earnings increased 164 to 154 per diluted share in 2006 from 131 per diluted share in 2005 earnings growth was primarily driven by strong identical supermarket sales growth improving operating margins and fewer shares outstanding in addition fiscal 2006 included a 53 rd week that benefited the year by an estimated 007 per diluted share adjustments to certain deferred tax balances that benefited the year by 003 per diluted share expense totaling 003 per diluted share for increases in legal reserves and 006 per diluted share of expense for the adoption of stock option expensing 

f uture e xpectations 

  while we were pleased with our 2006 results we must continue to adjust our business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers our plan requires balance between sales growth earnings growth and profitable capital investment 

  we expect to achieve identical supermarket sales growth through merchandising and operating initiatives that improve the shopping experience for our customers and continue building customer loyalty we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of 35 in 2007 

  to the extent that these sales initiatives involve price reductions or additional costs we expect they will be funded by operating cost reductions and productivity improvements we expect sales improvements and cost reductions combined with fewer shares outstanding to drive earnings per share growth in 2007 we expect earnings per share in 2007 of 160165 per diluted share this represents earnings per share growth of approximately 912 in 2007 net of the effect of a 53 rd week in fiscal 2006 of approximately 007 per diluted share 

  in addition on march 15 2007 the board of directors declared an increase in kroger’s quarterly dividend to 0075 per share 

  further discussion on our industry the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included in the “outlook” section 

r esults of o perations 

  the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods including goodwill and asset impairment charges and a labor dispute in southern california in 2004 

  net earnings loss 

  net earnings totaled 1115 million for 2006 compared to net earnings totaling 958 million in 2005 and a net loss totaling 104 million in 2004 the increase in our net earnings for 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 resulted from improvements in the southern california market and the leveraging of fixed costs with strong identical supermarket sales growth as well as the effect of a 53 rd week in 2006 in addition 2004 was negatively affected by goodwill charges totaling 904 million as well as a labor dispute in southern california 

  earnings per diluted share totaled 154 in 2006 compared to 131 per share in 2005 and a net loss of 014 per diluted share in 2004 net earnings in 2006 benefited by 007 per share due to the 53 rd week and 003 per share from the adjustment of certain deferred tax balances net earnings in 2006 also included expense of 003 per share recorded for legal reserves net earnings were reduced by 116 per share in 2004 due to the effects of goodwill impairment charges our earnings per share growth in 2006 and 2005 resulted from increased net earnings and the repurchase of kroger stock during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 29 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 633 million during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 15 million shares of our stock for a total investment of 252 million during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 20 million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of 319 million 

  sales 

    the growth in our total sales was primarily the result of identical store sales increases the addition of a 53 rd week in 2006 and inflation in pharmacy and some perishable commodities increased transaction count and average transaction size were both responsible for our increases in identical supermarket sales excluding retail fuel operations after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006 total sales increased 70 over fiscal 2005 

  we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 53week period of 2006 compared to the same 53week period of the previous year 

 

  we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the 53week period of 2006 compared to the same 53week period of the previous year 

 

  fifo gross margin 

  we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus lastin firstout “lifo” charge credit merchandise costs include advertising warehousing and transportation but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  our fifo gross margin rates were 2427 2480 and 2538 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively retail fuel sales lowered our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates were 2643 2669 and 2673 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in our nonfuel fifo gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers 

  operating general and administrative expenses 

  operating general and administrative “oga” expenses consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs among other items rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga 

  oga expenses as a percent of sales were 1791 1821 and 1876 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to nonfuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our oga expenses as a percent of sales were 1959 1968 and 1981 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effect of retail fuel operations expenses recorded for legal reserves and stock option expense our oga rate declined 28 basis points in 2006 this decrease was driven by identical store sales growth by increasing store labor productivity and by progress we have made in controlling our health care costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in pension expense and credit card fees 

  rent expense 

  rent expense was 649 million in 2006 as compared to 661 million and 680 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively rent expense as a percent of sales was 098 in 2006 as compared to 109 in 2005 and 121 in 2004 the decrease in rent expense reflects our increasing sales leverage and our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate when available as well as decreased charges for closedstore future rent liabilities in 2006 and 2005 compared to 2004 

  depreciation and amortization expense 

  depreciation and amortization expense was 1272 million 1265 million and 1256 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling 1777 million 1306 million and 1634 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales was 192 209 and 223 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales is primarily the result of total sales increases 

  interest expense 

  net interest expense totaled 488 million 510 million and 557 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in interest expense was the result of lower average borrowings during 2006 we reduced total debt 173 million from 72 billion as of january 28 2006 to 71 billion as of february 3 2007 interest expense in 2004 included 25 million related to the early retirement of debt 

  income taxes 

  our effective income tax rate was 362 372 and 1364 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 differ from the effective tax rate for 2004 due to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill in 2004 the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected federal statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes as well as the adjustment of certain deferred tax balances in 2006 

  during the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances after the filing of annual federal and state tax returns we identified adjustments to be made in the previous years’ deferred tax reconciliation we corrected these deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 which resulted in a reduction of our 2006 provision for income tax expense of approximately 21 million and reduced the rate by 120 basis points we do not believe these adjustments are material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 3 2007 or to any prior years’ consolidated financial statements as a result we have not restated any prior year amounts 

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  we maintain a stock repurchase program that complies with securities exchange act rule 10b51 to allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases totaling 374 million 239 million and 291 million under this repurchase program during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition to this repurchase program in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 259 million 13 million and 28 million under the stock option program during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

c apital e xpenditures 

  capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payable and excluding acquisitions totaled 1777 million in 2006 compared to 1306 million in 2005 and 1634 million in 2004 the decline in 2005 was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels merchandising and productivity projects the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

 c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  selfinsurance costs 

  we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february 3 2007 case reserves are established for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known 

  for both workers’ compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately 3 million general liability claims are not discounted 

  we are also similarly selfinsured for propertyrelated losses we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of 25 million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stoploss coverage is in excess of 50 million per claim up to 200 million per claim in california and 300 million outside of california 

  the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  impairments of longlived assets 

  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we record costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as “operating general and administrative” expense 

  the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing longlived assets for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results 

  goodwill 

  we review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value represents a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  intangible assets 

  in addition to goodwill we have recorded intangible assets totaling 26 million 22 million and 28 million for leasehold equities liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases respectively at february 3 2007 balances at january 28 2006 were 35 million 20 million and 30 million for lease equities liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription files respectively we amortize leasehold equities over the remaining life of the lease we do not amortize owned liquor licenses however we amortize liquor licenses that must be renewed over their useful lives we amortize pharmacy prescription file purchases over seven years we consider these assets annually during our testing for impairment 

  store closing costs 

  we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we classify inventory writedowns in connection with store closings if any in “merchandise costs” we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 

  postretirement benefit plans 

a companysponsored pension plans 

  effective february 3 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statements no 87 99 106 and 123r  which required the recognition of the funded status of its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we are now required to record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 

  the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 14 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  the objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of yearend 2006 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be “settled” theoretically by “investing” them in the zerocoupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows the selection of the 590 discount rate as of yearend 2006 represents the equivalent single rate under a broadmarket aa yield curve constructed by our outside consultant mercer human resource consulting we utilized a discount rate of 570 for yearend 2005 the 20 basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of february 3 2007 by approximately 68 million 

  to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for 2006 and 2005 we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 85 our pension plan’s average return was 97 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2006 net of all investment management fees and expenses our actual return for the pension plan calendar year ending december 31 2006 on that same basis was 134 we believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return we have been advised that during 2007 and 2008 the trustees plan to reduce from 50 to 42 the allocation of pension plan assets to domestic and international equities and increase from 18 to 27 the allocation to noncore assets including inflationlinked bonds commodities hedge funds and real estate furthermore in order to augment the return on domestic equities and investment grade debt securities during 2007 and 2008 the trustees plan to increase hedge funds within these sectors from 7 to 22 collectively these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets the trustees expect these changes will have little effect on the total return but will reduce the expected volatility of the return see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 

  sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger’s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 

   in 2005 we updated the mortality table used to determine average life expectancy in the calculation of our pension obligation to the rp2000 projected to 2015 mortality table the change in this assumption increased our projected benefit obligation by approximately 93 million at the time of the change and is reflected in unrecognized actuarial gain loss as of the measurement date 

  we contributed 150 million 300 million and 35 million to our companysponsored pension plans in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively although we are not required to make cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans during fiscal 2007 we contributed 50 million to the plans on february 5 2007 we may elect to make additional voluntary contributions to our companysponsored pension plans in order to maintain our desired funding status additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations we expect any elective contributions made during 2007 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  effective january 1 2007 the cash balance plan was replaced with a 401k retirement savings account plan which will provide both company matching contributions and other company contributions based upon length of service to eligible employees we expect to make matching contributions in 2007 of approximately 75 million 

b multiemployer plans 

  we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

  we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 204 million in 2006 196 million in 2005 and 180 million in 2004 we estimate we would have contributed an additional 2 million in 2004 but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the southern california labor dispute 

  based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2006 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding as of december 31 2006 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 600 million to 800 million pretax or 375 million to 500 million aftertax this represents a decrease in the amount of underfunding estimated as of december 31 2005 this decrease is attributable to among other things the continuing benefit of plan design changes and the investment returns on assets held in trust for the plans during 2006 our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 

  we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences we expect our contributions to these multiemployer plans will continue to increase each year and therefore the expense we recognize under gaap will increase in 2006 our contributions to these plans increased approximately 4 over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6 since 2003 we expect our contributions to increase by approximately 10 in 2007 the amount of increases in 2007 and beyond has been favorably affected by significant improvement in the values of assets held in trusts by the labor agreements negotiated in southern california and elsewhere in recent years and by related trustee actions although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions    

  the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding would increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

  deferred rent 

  we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

  tax contingencies 

  various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an allowance is audited and fully resolved as of february 3 2007 tax years 2002 through 2004 were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 

  the establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results could differ resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our consolidated statements of operations 

  to the extent that we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 

  sharebased compensation expense 

  effective january 29 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods under this method we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted on or after january 29 2006 as well as all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 29 2006 in accordance with sfas no 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r we recognize sharebased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award 

  prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for sharebased payments under accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 as amended we recognized compensation expense for all sharebased awards described above using the straightline attribution method applied to the fair value of each option grant over the requisite service period associated with each award the requisite service period is typically consistent with the vesting period except as noted below because awards typically vest evenly over the requisite service period compensation cost recognized in 2006 is at least equal to the grantdate fair value of the vested portion of all outstanding options 

  the weightedaverage fair value of stock options granted during 2006 2005 and 2004 was 690 770 and 791 respectively the fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model based on the assumptions shown in the table below the blackscholes model utilizes extensive accounting judgment and financial estimates including the term employees are expected to retain their stock options before exercising them the volatility of our stock price over that expected term the dividend yield over the term and the number of awards expected to be forfeited before they vest using alternative assumptions in the calculation of fair value would produce fair values for stock option grants that could be different than those used to record sharebased compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

  the following table reflects the weightedaverage assumptions used for grants awarded to option holders 

 

  the weightedaverage riskfree interest rate was based on the yield of a treasury note as of the grant date continuously compounded which matures at a date that approximates the expected term of the options prior to 2006 we did not pay a dividend so an expected dividend rate was not included in the determination of fair value for options granted during fiscal year 2005 using a dividend yield of 150 to value options issued in 2005 would have decreased the fair value of each option by approximately 160 we determined expected volatility based upon historical stock volatilities we also considered implied volatility we determined expected term based upon a combination of historical exercise and cancellation experience as well as estimates of expected future exercise and cancellation experience 

  under sfas no 123r we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award 

  in 2006 we recognized total stock compensation expense of 72 million this included 50 million for stock options and 22 million for restricted shares a total of 18 million of the restricted stock expense was attributable to the wider distribution of restricted shares incorporated into the first quarter 2006 grant of sharebased awards as described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and the remaining 4 million of restricted stock expense related to previously issued restricted stock awards the incremental compensation expense attributable to the adoption of sfas no 123r in 2006 was 68 million pretax or 43 million and 006 per diluted share after tax in 2005 we recognized stock compensation cost of 7 million pretax related entirely to restricted stock grants 

  these costs were recognized as operating general and administrative costs in our company’s consolidated statements of operations the cumulative effect of applying a forfeiture rate to unvested restricted shares at january 29 2006 was not material the pro forma earnings effect of stock options in prior years in accordance with sfas no 123 is described below 

 

 

  as of february 3 2007 we had 92 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under equity award plans we expected to recognize this cost over a weightedaverage period of approximately one year the total fair value of options that vested in 2006 was 44 million 

  for sharebased awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company’s stock option grants generally contained retirementeligibility provisions that caused the options to vest upon the earlier of the stated vesting date or retirement we calculated compensation expense over the stated vesting periods regardless of whether certain employees became retirementeligible during the respective vesting periods upon the adoption of sfas no 123r we continued this method of recognizing compensation expense of awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r for awards granted on or after january 29 2006 options vest based on the stated vesting date even if an employee retires prior to the vesting date however the requisite service period ends on the employee’s retirementeligible date as a result we recognize expense for stock option grants containing such retirementeligibility provisions over the shorter of the vesting period or the period until employees become retirementeligible the requisite service period as a result of retirement eligibility provisions in stock option awards granted on or after january 29 2006 we recognized approximately 6 million of compensation expense in 2006 prior to the completion of stated vesting periods 

  shares issued as a result of stock option exercises may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares we expect to reissue shares held in treasury upon exercise of these options 

  inventories 

  inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 98 of inventories for 2006 and 2005 respectively were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 450 million at february 3 2007 and by 400 million at january 28 2006 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 

  vendor allowances 

  we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and recognized as the product is sold we recognized approximately 33 billion 32 billion and 31 billion of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we recognized more than 80 of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns

  cash flow information 

  net cash provided by operating activities 

  we generated 2351 million of cash from operations in 2006 compared to 2192 million in 2005 and 2330 million in 2004 in addition to changes in net earnings changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the amount of cash provided by our operating activities during 2006 we realized a 129 million decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to a 121 million increase and a 116 million decrease during 2005 and 2004 respectively these amounts are net of cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans totaling 150 million in 2006 300 million in 2005 and 35 million in 2004 

  the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2006 was higher than the amounts paid in 2005 and 2004 due to higher net earnings in addition the bonus depreciation provision which expired in december 2004 reduced our cash taxes by approximately 90 million in 2004 this benefit reversed in 2005 and increased our cash taxes by approximately 71 and 108 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  net cash used by investing activities 

  cash used by investing activities was 1587 million in 2006 compared to 1279 million in 2005 and 1608 million in 2004 the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2006 due to increased capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of assets capital expenditures including changes in constructioninprogress payables and excluding acquisitions were 1777 million 1306 million and 1634 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 

  net cash used by financing activities 

  financing activities used 785 million of cash in 2006 compared to 847 million in 2005 and 737 million in 2004 lower cash payments for debt reduction in 2006 were partially offset by increased stock repurchase activities and dividend payments in 2006 we repurchased 633 million of kroger stock in 2006 compared to 252 million in 2005 and 319 million in 2004 and paid dividends totaling 140 million in 2006 

  debt management 

  total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases and financing obligations decreased 173 million to 71 billion as of yearend 2006 from 72 billion as of yearend 2005 total debt decreased 739 million to 72 billion as of yearend 2005 from 80 billion as of yearend 2004 the decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt 

  our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2006 2005 and 2004 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 17 million 27 million and 70 million as of yearend 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  factors affecting liquidity 

  we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 170 million under our f2p2a3 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility we have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbbbaa2bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity borrowings under the credit facility may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 

  our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense as defined in the credit facility was 750 to 1 as of february 3 2007 upon furnishing notice to the lenders this ratio will entitle us to a 005 reduction in fees under the credit facility although our current borrowing rate is determined based on our applicable percentage ratio under certain circumstances that borrowing rate could be determined by reference to our credit ratings   our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was 204 to 1 as of february 3 2007 if this ratio exceeded 350 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired   our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was 366 to 1 as of february 3 2007 if this ratio fell below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired   consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreement is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2006 

  the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february 3 2007 in millions of dollars 

    our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  as of february 3 2007 we maintained a fiveyear revolving credit facility totaling 25 billion which terminates in 2011 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility in addition to the credit facility we maintain a 50 million money market line borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facility the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of february 3 2007 we had outstanding borrowings totaling 352 million under our credit agreement and commercial paper program we had no borrowings under the money market line as of february 3 2007 the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facility totaled 331 million as of february 3 2007 

  in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 3 2007 we had available for issuance 12 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and declared effective on december 9 2004 

  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and are placed with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our selfinsured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 

  most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of our subsidiaries see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of three real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 6 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february 3 2007 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

  we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 

  in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while kroger’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are aware of no current matter that we expect to result in a material liability

  this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected change in net earnings identical sales growth expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “will” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21 e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 

we expect earnings per share in the range of 160165 for 2007 this represents earnings per share growth of approximately 912 in 2007 net of the effect of a 53 rd week in fiscal 2006 of approximately 007 per diluted share   we anticipate earnings per share growth rates in the 1 st and 4 th quarters of 2007 will be less than the annual growth rate and the 2 nd and 3 rd quarter growth rates will be higher than the annual growth rate    we expect identical food store sales growth excluding fuel sales of 35 in 2007   in fiscal 2007 we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers we expect operating margins to improve slightly in 2007   we plan to use over the longterm onethird of cash flow for debt reduction and twothirds for stock repurchase and payment of a cash dividend   we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations   capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investment for 2007 to be in the range of 1921 billion excluding acquisitions total food store square footage is expected to grow approximately 2 before acquisitions and operational closings   based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions   we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher energy costs pension costs and credit card fees as well as any future labor disputes offset by improved productivity from process changes cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and leverage gained through sales increases   we expect that our effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately 38 excluding any effects from the implementation of fin no 48   we expect rent expense as a percent of total sales and excluding closedstore activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate we believe that in 2007 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration labor shrink warehousing and transportation these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers   although we are not required to make cash contributions during fiscal 2007 we made a 50 million cash contribution to our companysponsored pension plans on february 5 2007 additional voluntary contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations we expect any additional elective contributions made during 2007 will reduce our contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions in addition we expect to make automatic and matching cash contributions to the 401k retirement savings account plan totaling 75 million in 2007   we expect our contributions to multiemployer pension plans to increase at 10 over the 204 million we contributed during 2006   various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include 

we have various labor agreements expiring in 2007 covering associates in southern california cincinnati detroit houston memphis toledo seattle and west virginia we are currently operating under a contract extension in southern california in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations third parties who operate a distribution facility for us in louisville kentucky are operating without a labor agreement and the union representing employees there may call a strike if an agreement is not reached a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material effect on our results   our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors our response to these actions the state of the economy including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans   in addition to the factors identified above our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales the effect of our “sister stores” new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing   our operating margins could fail to improve as expected if we are unsuccessful at containing our operating costs   we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business as well as in material litigation facing kroger and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable unexpected outcomes in these matters however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings   the proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt repurchase common stock and pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for prepayments changes in borrowing rates and the market price of kroger common stock   consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable cannot be foreseen   rent expense which includes subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy increased store closure activity and future consolidation   depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets or the remaining terms of leases use of the straightline method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset writeoffs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed   our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the amount of our matching cash contributions under our 401k retirement savings account plan will be affected by the actual amounts contributed by participants    we believe the multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded should asset values in these funds deteriorate or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated   the grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers supercenters mass merchandisers club or warehouse stores drug stores and restaurants our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales thus reducing margins while we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales   changes in laws or regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements   changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions including the rate of inflation population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers which could affect sales and earnings   changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins including generating decreased margins as the market price increases we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales   our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations   our capital expenditures expected square footage growth and number of store projects completed during the year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget   interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment changes in the company’s credit ratings fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations that results in an increase in debt   adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products or may decrease the customer demand for certain products additionally increases in the cost of inputs such as utility costs or raw material costs could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings   although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers our fifo gross margin and net earnings will suffer   other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  financial risk management 

  we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  as of february 3 2007 we maintained six interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 1050 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between march 2008 and january 2015 variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate “libor” the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of february 3 2007 other longterm liabilities totaling 28 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  in addition as of february 3 2007 we maintained three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 750 million to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates including general corporate spreads on debt for an established period of time we entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal 2007 and 2008 accordingly these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances two of these swaps have tenyear terms with the remaining swap having a twelveyear term beginning with the issuance of the debt the average fixed rate for these instruments is 514 and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap as of february 3 2007 we had recorded an other asset totaling 12 million to reflect the fair value of these agreements 

  during 2003 we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that we accounted for as fair value hedges we recorded approximately 114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and they are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt as of february 3 2007 the unamortized balances totaled approximately 46 million 

  annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february 3 2007 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february 3 2007 interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 3 2007 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february 3 2007 refer to notes 5 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

   commodity price protection 

  we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so as of february 3 2007 we maintained seven derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices these derivatives contain a threeyear term none of the contracts either individually or in the aggregate hedge more than 50 of our expected corrugated cardboard sales the instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended accordingly changes in the fair value of these instruments are markedtomarket in our consolidated statements of operations in oga expenses as of february 3 2007 an accrued expense totaling 02 million had been recorded for the instruments

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

as of january 29 2005 we maintained a fiveyear revolving credit facility totaling 18 billion which terminates in 2009 in addition we maintained a 700 million fiveyear credit facility that terminates in 2007 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facilities in addition to the credit facilities we maintain a 75 million money market line borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities as of january 29 2005 our outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings totaled 694 million we had no borrowings under the money market line as of january 29 2005 the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled 312 million as of january 29 2005 we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts accordingly the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 

at january 29 2005 we also had a 100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the 25 billion described above funds received under this 100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility as of january 29 2005 we had no borrowings under this 100 million facility 

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 29 2005 we had available for issuance 12 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and declared effective on december 9 2004 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities 

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of four real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 12 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 29 2005 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 

in addition to the above the company enters into various indemnification agreements and takes on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to the company indemnities related to the sale of company securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while the company’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability the company is aware of no current matter that it expects to result in a material liability

in may 2004 the fasb issued staff position “fsp” no 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” fsp no 1062 supersedes fsp no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” and provides guidance on the accounting disclosure and transition related to the prescription drug act fsp no 1062 became effective for the third quarter of 2004 the adoption of fsp no 1062 had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements detailed regulations in this area continue to evolve that could have an effect on the company going forward which effect we do not expect to be material 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction of qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” which provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the act’s qualified production activities deduction the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its effective tax rate for 2005 and subsequent periods 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 supersedes apb no 25 and related interpretation and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” the provisions of sfas no 123r are similar to those of sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant fair value of sharebased awards will be determined using option price models eg blackscholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest we expect to adopt sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 and expect it will reduce net earnings by 004 to 005 per diluted share for fiscal 2006 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” which clarifies that inventory costs that are “abnormal” are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost sfas no 151 provides examples of “abnormal” costs to included costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage sfas no 151 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january 29 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

fasb interpretation no 47 “fin 47” “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in march 2005 fin 47 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity the interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we do not expect adoption of fin 47 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

o ur b usiness 

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 it is one of the nation’s largest retailers operating 2532 stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food 4 less king soopers smith’s fry’s fry’s marketplace dillons qfc and city market the company also operates 795 convenience stores 436 fine jewelry stores and 536 supermarket fuel centers 

kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply about twothirds of the private label grocery products sold in the company’s retail outlets 

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses the company’s operations are reported as a single operating segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 

o ur 2004 p erformance 

the operating environment of the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition aggressive supercenter expansion increasing fragmentation of retail formats and market consolidation over the past several years many traditional supermarket operators including kroger have experienced declining profit margins in an effort to maintain market share we have lowered retail prices at a rate faster than we were able to reduce costs 

kroger recognized the major changes in the operating environment and in 2001 we implemented a plan to transition to a lower gross margin environment during 2002 and 2003 our identical food store sales without fuel declined in 2004 we were pleased with the progress of our identical sales excluding the effect of fuel and the southern california labor dispute which has now shown sequential improvement for seven of the past eight quarters identical food store sales on this same basis increased 12 in 2004 this nearly met the 13 target we established at the beginning of the year this was accomplished by focusing on our customers’ needs of highquality perishable products and lowering selected prices 

our internal analysis shows that we hold the 1 or 2 position in 40 of our 52 major markets we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores according to our internal market share estimates which include all retail outlets including supercenters and other nontraditional retail formats kroger’s market share increased in 23 of our 52 major markets in 2004 declined in 27 and remained unchanged in two six of the 27 markets in which our market share declined are in california including five markets that were significantly affected by the southern california labor dispute on a volumeweighted basis kroger’s overall market share declined slightly in our 52 major markets 

our 2003 and 2004 financial results were affected by asset and goodwill impairment charges and two labor disputes that occurred in southern california and west virginia in west virginia we closed 44 stores starting october 13 2003 when a strike was conducted by a local union of the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” these stores were reopened on december 11 2003 after ratification of a new contract in southern california our ralphs stores as well as stores operated by safeway inc and albertson’s inc were subject to a labor dispute that started on october 12 2003 and ended 141 days later on february 29 2004 we are working hard to rebuild our business in this region the recovery from the labor dispute has been slower than we expected we continue to emphasize store conditions associate training associate engagement and competitive pricing we are making progress and have a plan in place to return sales to prestrike levels 

excluding the impairment charges and the effect of the strikes our net earnings still declined in 2004 our increased sales did not translate to increased bottom line earnings the competitive environment’s pressure on retail prices combined with increased inflation in product costs and increasingly priceconscience consumers have resulted in lower gross profit additionally increases in operating and administrative costs especially employee health care costs and pension costs have been increasing at a higher rate than sales 

f uture e xpectations 

we believe that kroger is now positioned despite intense price competition to increase total sales identical store sales and earnings kroger’s plan starts with the customer we are listening to our customers through research and focus groups our plan centers around those areas that our customers have told us are important our focus is on differentiating our stores being competitive on price and providing our customers a superior shopping experience as compared to our competitors in terms of service product quality and variety 

the plan should allow us to build a stronger relationship with our customers position kroger as the retailer of choice and generate a satisfactory return for our shareholders significant sustainable cost reductions will enable us to achieve our plan costs savings will be derived from areas such as process improvements restructured labor contracts that will allow us to remain competitive lower product costs and technology utilization 

kroger’s financial strength is an important competitive advantage our free cash flow permits us to upgrade and expand our asset base in order to offer customers clean modern stores that enhance their shopping experience our cash flow also enables us to continue reducing debt and buy back stock 

in addition to financial strength kroger has many other key strengths such as a high quality asset base with leading market shares broad geographic diversity multiple retail formats customer loyalty data and data analysis capability a successful track record against supercenter competition and industry leading corporate brands 

kroger is focused on consistently meeting the needs of our customers by providing improved service selection and value our associates are key to kroger’s success we expect the successful execution of our strategy will be clearly evident in our 2005 financial results 

further discussion on our industry the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included in “outlook” 

r estatement of f inancial s tatements 

we restated our consolidated financial statements as of january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 and for the three years ended january 29 2005 january 31 2004 and february 1 2003 as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the restatement corrects errors identified in our deferred income tax accounts pertaining to i differences between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and the related effect on recorded goodwill and ii differences between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of longlived assets that were not reconciled to the deferred tax balances 

the correction of the abovenoted errors reduced 2004 and 2003 net earnings due to increases in goodwill impairment charges by 4 million and  27 million respectively these adjustments reduced 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per share by 000 and 004 respectively these adjustments had no effect on cash flow from operations 

r esults of o perations 

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2004 compared to 2003 and for 2003 compared to 2002 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods including goodwill and asset impairment charges and labor disputes in west virginia and southern california these items are identified and discussed in more detail below in “other items” and “estimated effect of labor disputes” 

net earnings loss 

we recorded a net loss totaling 104 million or 014 per share for 2004 compared to net earnings totaling 285 million or 038 per diluted share as restated in 2003 and net earnings of 1202 million or 152 per diluted share in 2002 the decrease in net earnings in 2004 and 2003 was significantly affected by labor disputes as well as goodwill and asset impairment charges these items are more fully described below in “other items” and “estimated effect of labor disputes” lower gross margins a result of our investment in pricing due to the competitive operating environment also affect our yeartoyear net earnings results 

sales 

total sales 

in millions 

 

 the change in our total sales is driven by identical store sales and square footage growth as well as inflation in fuel and other commodities 

we define a food store as an identical store when the store has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized below 

identical food store sales 

in millions 

 

 we define a food store as a comparable store when the store has been in operation for five full quarters including expansions and relocations we calculate annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below 

comparable food store sales 

in millions 

 

  our sales in 2004 were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups our competitive operating environment the recovery from the labor disputes in west virginia and southern california and the results of our strategic initiatives 

fifo gross margin 

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus lastin firstout “lifo” charge credit merchandise costs include advertising warehousing and transportation but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness our fifo gross margin rates were 2541 2638 and 2685 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively these declining rates reflect our continued investment in lower retail prices higher fuel sales that carry a low gross profit rate reduced our fifo gross margin rates by 135 93 and 69 basis points in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the southern california labor dispute and our related recovery efforts reduced gross profit rates in both 2004 and 2003 additionally other items recorded as merchandise costs in 2004 2003 and 2002 further affected our fifo gross margin rates these items are more fully described below in “other items” and “estimated effect of labor disputes” 

operating general and administrative expenses 

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs as a percent of sales were 1880 1925 and 1858 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively higher fuel sales reduced our oga rate by 105 73 and 48 basis points in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described in “other items” and “estimated effect of labor disputes” affected our oga rates in 2004 and 2003 

we continue to emphasize cost containment efforts in all areas and especially in the wage and benefit areas in the fourth quarter of 2004 health care costs declined slightly as a percent of sales the result of progress we have made during labor negotiations we expect additional improvement in our oga rate in 2005 particularly as we leverage increasing sales and cost reductions in key areas of our business 

rent expense 

rent expense as a percent of sales was 121 122 and 127 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decreases in these rates reflect our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate partially offset by increased charges for the net present value of lease liabilities recorded for store closings 

depreciation expense 

depreciation expense as a percent of sales was 222 225 and 210 for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the change in these rates reflects our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate offset by tightening of capital expenditures and the leveraging effect of increased sales 

interest expense 

net interest expense totaled 557 million 604 million and 619 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average borrowings and lower average rates on outstanding debt interest expense in 2004 2003 and 2002 included 25 million 18 million and 19 million respectively related to the early retirement of debt more fully described in “other items” 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 1364 614 and 375 for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the effective tax rates for 2004 and 2003 differ from the effective tax rate for 2002 due to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill in 2004 and 2003 the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 

o ther i tems 

the following table summarizes items that affected kroger’s financial results during the periods presented these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings net cash provided by operating activities or any other generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure of performance or liquidity these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger’s results as reported in accordance with gaap 

these items include goodwill impairment charges asset impairment charges restructuring charges mergerrelated costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations the items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of fifo gross margin lifo charge credit oga expense and interest expense 

 

    items affecting fifo gross margin lifo charge credit and operating general and administrative expense 

itemcost conversion 

in 1998 prior to the merger with fred meyer we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the itemcost method the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method 

during 2002 we adopted the itemcost method for the former fred meyer divisions the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february 3 2002 cannot be determined the effect of the change on the february 3 2002 inventory valuations which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods was included in results for the quarter ended may 25 2002 this change increased merchandise costs by 91 million and reduced net earnings by 57 million we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods the itemcost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to adoption on february 3 2002 

adoption of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0216 

we adopted eitf issue no 0216 during 2002 this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory historically we had recognized those allowances as they were earned based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract this accounting treatment was consistent with gaap for all contracts entered into or modified after january 1 2003 we have recognized prospectively and will continue to recognize vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold in accordance with issue 0216 net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of issue no 0216 adoption of the issue resulted in a 28 million pretax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002 this expense was offset by a corresponding 28 million pretax lifo credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002 

lease liabilities – store closing plans 

due to operational changes performance improved at five stores not yet closed for which store closing liabilities had been recorded as a part of a corporatelevel strategic plan as a result of this improved performance in 2003 we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open additionally closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated in total in 2003 we recorded pretax income of 10 million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 

no charges were recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the 2003 asset impairment review in accordance with sfas no 146 which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed during fiscal 2004 we recorded lease liabilities totaling 24 million related to the closing of 41 of these stores 

excess energy purchase commitments 

during 2001 we recorded a pretax charge of 81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity sfas no 133 required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through currentperiod earnings each quarter we recorded pretax expense of 4 million and pretax income of 19 million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in 2003 and 2002 respectively 

during 2003 we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in california with dynegy inc related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts the federal energy regulatory commission approved the agreement on july 23 2003 during 2003 we paid 107 million before the related tax benefits to settle disputes with dynegy related to prior overpayments terminate two of the four contracts effective july 6 2003 and terminate the remaining two agreements effective september 1 2003 as a result of the settlement we recorded 62 million of pretax expense in 2003 

property tax allowance 

in 2003 we recorded pretax income of 20 million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual after we determined the amount to be paid would be less than we originally estimated 

power outage 

in 2003 we recorded a 9 million pretax expense for the august power outage in northwest ohio and michigan the majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses generally we classify uninsured product and property losses as oga expense 

adjustment to charitable contribution liability 

in 2003 we recorded 5 million of pretax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the fred meyer merger we are required to make the remaining 14 million contribution by may 2006 

items affecting interest expense 

we adopted sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” in the first quarter of 2003 as a result expenses related to the early retirement of debt which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of sfas no 145 are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods the 2004 expenses of 3 million pretax related to a premium paid in connection with the redemption of our 750 million 7375 bonds due march 2005 net of the effect of reduced interest expense for the balance of the year the 2003 expenses of 18 million pretax related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of 100 million of longterm bonds and the writeoff of the related deferred financing costs 

goodwill impairment charge 

we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by sfas no 142 during the fourth quarter of 2004 this review resulted in a 904 million noncash impairment charge as restated related to goodwill at our ralphs and food 4 less divisions the impairment charge most of which is nondeductible for income tax purposes adjusted the carrying value of the divisions’ goodwill to its implied fair value the divisions’ operating performance suffered due to the intense competitive environment following the 2003 southern california labor dispute and recovery period the decreased operating performance was the result of the investments in personnel training capital and price reductions necessary to regain ralphs’ lost business and to maintain business gained by food 4 less stores that were not subject to the labor dispute as a result of this decline in operating performance the divisions’ carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value resulting in the impairment charge no impairment for goodwill at our other divisions was indicated during this review 

during our annual review in 2003 we recorded a 471 million noncash goodwill impairment charge as restated related to the goodwill at our smith’s division following a substantial decline in the operating performance of the division compared to 2002 operating performance and expected future performance 

asset impairment charges and related items 

in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we recorded impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003 these losses which are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as “asset impairment charges” totaled 120 million pretax the impairment review was conducted as a consequence of a corporatelevel strategic plan that coordinated the closing of several locations over a relatively short period of time as a result of deteriorating operating performance during the fourth quarter of 2003 we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on operating results for 2002 and 2003 as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond this event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other underperforming locations in the fourth quarter of 2003 these charges are more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring charges 

on december 11 2001 we outlined our strategic growth plan the “plan” to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share restructuring charges related to the plan totaled 15 million pretax in 2002 the majority of the charge related to severance agreements distribution center consolidation and conversion costs no restructuring charges were recorded in 2004 and 2003 

mergerrelated costs 

during 2002 we recorded pretax expenses of 1 million from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger no mergerrelated costs were recorded during 2004 or 2003 please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of this charge 

cumulative effect of an accounting change 

we adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 142 resulted in a 26 million pretax noncash loss to writeoff the goodwill at our jewelry store division based on its implied fair value impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and a review of the projected cash flows on a discounted basis rather than an undiscounted basis as was the standard under sfas no 121 prior to the adoption of sfas no 142 we recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of a 10 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2002 

e stimated e ffect of l abor d isputes 

the following table summarizes the estimated effect of labor disputes on kroger’s financial results these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings net cash provided by operating activities or any other gaap measure of performance or liquidity these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger’s results as reported in accordance with gaap due to the nature of these items as described below it is important to identify the items and review them in conjunction with kroger’s financial results reported in accordance with gaap 

for the disputeaffected regions we compared actual results to budgeted results from the start of the disputes through the first two quarters of 2004 in establishing budgets for 2004 we took into account trends existing in the market prior to the labor disputes as well as changes in our business plan strategies based on those budgets the estimated effects included the difference between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the difference between reported oga and oga projections while we have relied on the accuracy of our budgets significant amounts of judgment were used to develop those budgets and actual results had there been no labor disputes may have differed from those budgets 

included in the estimated effect of labor disputes were charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and oga expense the 2003 calculation includes the effect of both the southern california and west virginia strikes the estimated 

effect includes all costs associated with the work stoppages including expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement in southern california entered into with safeway inc and albertson’s inc and poststrike recovery expenses through the second quarter of 2004 in the third quarter of 2004 we discontinued reporting the estimated strike effect for southern california 

 

  differences affecting fifo gross margin included incremental warehousing distribution advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses incurred during the labor dispute as well as the investment in fifo gross margin through targeted price reductions and advertising in order to regain our sales during the poststrike recovery period differences in oga included costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers costs associated with bringing in employees from other kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement and costs related to hiring and training workers to replace associates who did not return to work after the labor disputes ended 

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

in december 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately 28 million 24 million and 65 million under the stock option program in during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively on december 10 2002 kroger’s board of directors the “board” authorized an additional stock repurchase program totaling 500 million we made open market purchases totaling 277 million and 63 million under this plan in 2003 and 2002 during fiscal 2004 we made open market purchases of approximately 144 million to complete the program in september 2004 the board authorized a new 500 million stock repurchase program to replace the december 2002 program as of january 29 2005 we had made purchases totaling 147 million under the september 2004 program 

c apital e xpenditures 

capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled 16 billion in 2004 compared to 20 billion in 2003 and 19 billion in 2002 the decline in 2004 was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels merchandising and productivity projects capital expenditure included 202 million and 192 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

supermarket storing activity 

 

 c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

selfinsurance costs 

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 29 2005 casereserves are established for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known 

the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers’ compensation liabilities was 38 million as of january 29 2005 we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

impairments of longlived assets 

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if impairment is identified for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition 

we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels generally for reviews performed by local management costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “operating general and administrative” expense costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets that result from corporatelevel strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” refer to “other items” for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during 2003 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value represents a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2004 2003 and 2002 are summarized in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation the economy and market competition 

intangible assets 

in addition to goodwill the company has recorded intangible assets totaling 20 million and 29 million for liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases respectively at january 29 2005 balances at january 31 2004 were 20 million for liquor licenses and 21 million for pharmacy prescription files owned liquor licenses are not amortized while liquor licenses that must be renewed are amortized over their useful life pharmacy prescription file purchases are amortized over seven years we test these assets annually for impairment 

store closing costs 

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms 

associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions however the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets inventory writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in “merchandise costs” costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 19 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

the discount rate is based primarily on the yield on highquality fixed income investments as of the measurement date we lowered the discount rate to 575 as of january 29 2005 from 625 as of january 31 2004 the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 29 2005 by 120 million in 2005 we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by 15 million as a result of this change 

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for 2004 we assumed a pension return rate of 85 consistent with 2003 our pension plan’s average return was 109 for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2004 net of all investment management fees and expenses we believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return 

in addition to the 35 million we contributed in 2004 and the 100 million we contributed in 2003 we are required to make cash contributions totaling 142 million to our companysponsored pension plan during fiscal 2005 we may make additional contributions during 2005 in order to maintain our desired funding status we expect any additional contributions during 2005 will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

b multiemployer plans 

we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining 

agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 

we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of 180 million in 2004 169 million in 2003 and 153 million in 2002 we estimate we would have contributed an additional 2 million in 2004 and 13 million in 2003 but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the labor disputes 

based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multiemployer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets ie the amount of underfunding as of december 31 2004 because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger’s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger’s “share” of the underfunding as of december 31 2004 we estimate that kroger’s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which kroger contributes was 10 to 13 billion pretax our estimate is based on actuarial evaluations and other data which itself includes estimates our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 

we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences we expect our contributions to these multiemployer plans will continue to increase each year and therefore the expense we recognize under gaap will increase we expect our contributions in 2005 will increase approximately 20 percent and we expect that amount to increase by about five percent each year thereafter the amount of increases in 2005 and beyond has been favorably affected by the labor agreements negotiated in southern california and elsewhere during 2004 and by related trustee actions although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 

the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described the amount could decline and kroger’s future expense would be favorably affected if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand kroger’s share of the underfunding would increase and kroger’s future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline or if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation 

deferred rent 

we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straightline basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

tax contingencies 

various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an allowance is audited and fully resolved as of january 29 2005 tax years 1999 to 2002 were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 

the establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results could differ resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent the we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 

stock option plans 

we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans accordingly because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date no stockbased compensation expense is included in net earnings other than expenses related to restricted stock awards notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 of inventories for 2004 and 2003 respectively were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 373 million at january 29 2005 and by 324 million at january 31 2004 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

the itemcost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all nonperishable store inventories and some perishable departments at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date

cash flow information 

net cash provided by operating activities 

we generated 2330 million of cash from operations in 2004 compared to 2215 million in 2003 and 3183 million in 2002 changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities during 2004 we realized a 21 million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a 255 million increase during 2003 and a 302 million reduction during 2002 fluctuations in our accounts payable balances and store deposit intransit balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 and 2002 the increase in our store deposits intransit balances in 2003 was primarily related 

to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks offsetting the changes in our store deposits intransit balances our other current liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the labor disputes discussed in “estimated effect of labor disputes” in 2002 our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position 

the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2004 was higher than the amount paid in 2003 due primarily to higher earnings before the effect of goodwill impairment charges in addition the bonus depreciation provision which expired in december 2004 reduced our cash taxes in 2004 2003 and 2002 and we expect the cash benefit will reverse in 2005 this provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately 106 million 130 million and 106 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

our 2004 and 2003 operating cash flow results also reflect cash contributions totaling 35 million and 100 million respectively to our companysponsored pension plan 

net cash used by investing activities 

cash used by investing activities was 1608 million in 2004 compared to 2026 million in 2003 and 1907 million in 2002 the amount of cash used by investing activities in 2004 decreased from 2003 and 2002 due to reduced capital expenditures 

net cash used by financing activities 

financing activities used 737 million of cash in 2004 compared to 201 million in 2003 and 1266 million in 2002 the increase in cash used by financing in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily related to the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt the decrease in the use of cash in 2003 versus 2002 was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases the decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in 2003 versus 2002 as well as to proceeds received in 2003 from interest rate swap terminations 

debt management 

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases decreased 393 million to 80 billion as of yearend 2004 from 84 billion as of yearend 2003 total debt decreased 210 million to 84 billion as of yearend 2003 from 86 billion as of yearend 2002 the decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt approximately 65 million of the decrease experienced in 2003 resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity 

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2004 2003 and 2002 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 70 million 104 million and 110 million as of yearend 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

factors affecting liquidity 

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 500 million to 600 million under our a2p2f2 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbb baa2bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities under which we believe we have sufficient capacity borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days 

although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio on march 16 2005 standard  poor’s ratings services placed its ratings for kroger as well as safeway inc and albertson’s inc on creditwatch with negative implications standard  poor’s indicated they expect any downgrade if warranted by their review should be limited to one level with ratings not expected to fall below investment grade 

our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

 

  

  

 consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facilities includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreements are more particularly described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2004 

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january 29 2005 in millions of dollars 

 

   we are required to make cash contributions totaling 142 million to our companysponsored pension plans during fiscal 2005 we may make additional contributions to these plans in order to maintain our desired funding status we expect any additional contributions made during 2005 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions at this time it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2006 and beyond 

our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

as of january 29 2005 we maintained a fiveyear revolving credit facility totaling 18 billion which terminates in 2009 in addition we maintained a 700 million fiveyear credit facility that terminates in 2007 outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facilities in addition to the credit facilities we maintain a 75 million money market line borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities as of january 29 2005 our outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings totaled 694 million we had no borrowings under the money market line as of january 29 2005 the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled 312 million as of january 29 2005 we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts accordingly the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 

at january 29 2005 we also had a 100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the 25 billion described above funds received under this 100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility as of january 29 2005 we had no borrowings under this 100 million facility 

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 29 2005 we had available for issuance 12 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and declared effective on december 9 2004 

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities 

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of four real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 12 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 29 2005 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain thirdparty logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 

in addition to the above the company enters into various indemnification agreements and takes on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to the company indemnities related to the sale of company securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while the company’s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability the company is aware of no current matter that it expects to result in a material liability 

r ecently i ssued a ccounting s tandards 

in may 2004 the fasb issued staff position “fsp” no 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” fsp no 1062 supersedes fsp no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” and provides guidance on the accounting disclosure and transition related to the prescription drug act fsp no 1062 became effective for the third quarter of 2004 the adoption of fsp no 1062 had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements detailed regulations in this area continue to evolve that could have an effect on the company going forward which effect we do not expect to be material 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction of qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” which provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the act’s qualified production activities deduction the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its effective tax rate for 2005 and subsequent periods 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 supersedes apb no 25 and related interpretation and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” the provisions of sfas no 123r are similar to those of sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant fair value of sharebased awards will be determined using option price models eg blackscholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest we expect to adopt sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 and expect it will reduce net earnings by 004 to 005 per diluted share for fiscal 2006 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” which clarifies that inventory costs that are “abnormal” are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost sfas no 151 provides examples of “abnormal” costs to included costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage sfas no 151 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january 29 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

fasb interpretation no 47 “fin 47” “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in march 2005 fin 47 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity the interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we do not expect adoption of fin 47 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

o utlook 

this discussion and analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information available as of april 15 2005 the original date of our filing on form 10k such statements relate to among other things projected change in net earnings identical sales growth expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as “comfortable” “committed” “expect” “goal” “should” “intend” “target” “believe” “anticipate” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of january 29 2005 the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer together with a disclosure review committee appointed by the chief executive officer evaluated kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation kroger’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness set forth below in “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of january 29 2005 

m anagement ’ s c onsideration o f t he r estatement 

management concluded that the restatement items described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements that pertain to the determination of deferred income tax balances related to business combinations were an additional effect of the material weakness described below 

management concluded that the tax matters unrelated to business combinations described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate did not constitute a material weakness management reviewed and analyzed the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin sab no 99 “materiality” paragraph 29 of accounting principles board opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” and sab topic 5f “accounting changes not retroactively applied due to immateriality” and took into consideration i that the restatement adjustments did not have a material effect on the financial statements of any prior interim or annual periods taken as a whole ii that the cumulative effect of the restatement adjustments on shareowners’ equity was not material to the financial statements of any prior interim or annual periods and iii that the company decided to restate its previously issued financial statements solely because the cumulative effect of the adjustments would have been material to fourth quarter 2005 net income 

m anagement ’ s r eport o n i nternal c ontrol o ver f inancial r eporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in internal control – integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of january 29 2005 due to the material weakness described below 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected as of january 29 2005 we did not maintain effective internal control over the determination of deferred income tax balances related to a business combination specifically controls over the processes and procedures in calculating deferred income tax liabilities related to a business combination were not effective to ensure that the deferred income tax liabilities and allocated goodwill were fairly stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this deficiency resulted in a yearend audit adjustment affecting deferred income tax liabilities goodwill and the goodwill impairment charge additionally this control deficiency could result in a misstatement in the aforementioned accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected therefore we have concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 

management previously concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 29 2005 because of the material weakness described above management has determined that the restatement described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements pertaining to the determination of deferred income tax balances related to business combinations was an additional effect of the material weakness described above accordingly the restatement did not affect management’s assessment on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 29 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 29 2005 which can be found in item 8 of this form 10ka 

c hanges i n i nternal c ontrol o ver f inancial r eporting 

in connection with the evaluation described above there was no change in kroger’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended january 29 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect kroger’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

o ur c ompany 

  

the kroger co was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 as of january 31 2004 we were one of the largest grocery retailers in the united states based on annual sales we also manufacture and process food for sale in our supermarkets we employ approximately 290000 full and parttime employees our principal executive offices are located at 1014 vine street cincinnati ohio 45202 and our telephone number is 513 7624000 we maintain a web site wwwkrogercom which includes additional information about our company we make available through our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q and our current reports on form 8k including amendments thereto these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them electronically with the sec 

  

our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our supermarkets we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses 

  

o ur s tores 

  

as of january 31 2004 we operated either directly or through our subsidiaries 2532 supermarkets approximately 30 of these supermarkets operated in companyowned facilities as of january 31 2004 466 of these supermarkets had fuel centers our current growth strategy emphasizes selfdevelopment and ownership of store real estate our stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity our supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores “combo stores” multidepartment stores or price impact warehouse stores 

  

the combo stores are our primary food store format they are typically able to earn a return above our cost of capital by drawing customers from a 2 – 2 ½ mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for onestop shopping including “whole health” sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce many combination stores include a fuel center 

  

multidepartment stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multidepartment stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive toys and fine jewelry many multidepartment stores include a fuel center 

  

price impact warehouse stores offer a “nofrills low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 

  

in addition to our supermarkets we operate either directly or through subsidiaries 802 convenience stores and 440 fine jewelry stores our subsidiaries operated 707 of the convenience stores while 95 were operated through franchise agreements approximately 43 of the convenience stores operated by our subsidiaries were operated in companyowned facilities the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and in most cases sell gasoline 

  

m erchandising and m anufacturing 

  

corporate brand products play an important role in our merchandising strategy our supermarket divisions typically stock approximately 7800 private label items our corporate brand products are produced and sold in three quality “tiers” private selection is the premium quality brand designed to meet or beat the “gourmet” or “upscale” national or regional brands the “banner brand” kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of our private label items is designed to be equal to or better than the national brand and carries the “try it like it or get the national brand free” guarantee fmv for maximum value is the value brand designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price 

  

approximately 55 of the corporate brand units sold are produced in our manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers we perform a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of marketbased transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january 31 2004 we operated 42 manufacturing plants these plants consisted of 18 dairies 11 deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants three beverage plants three meat plants and two cheese plants 

  

o perating e nvironment 

  

traditional grocery retailers including kroger have experienced significant business challenges in recent years consumers have remained cautious in their purchases amid concerns about the economy and high unemployment while competition has continued to intensify customers today have a larger number of stores and greater variety of retail formats from which to select these factors have placed pressure on retail prices additionally our company as well as several of our traditional competitors has faced dramatic increases in certain operating costs particularly labor and employee benefit costs in unionized markets 

  

our management team identified these trends more than two years ago and implemented strategic initiatives designed to control costs and offer better value to our customers we have made progress since that time we believe future industry consolidation is likely and presents opportunities for kroger to gain market share and improve financial results as weaker competitors decline in or exit markets and their sales base is picked up by their competitors 

  

kroger has a highquality asset base that holds the 1 or 2 market share in 43 of our 52 major markets with leading market share in many of the nation’s largest and fastestgrowing markets we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores according to our internal share estimates kroger’s share increased in 28 of our 52 major markets in 2003 on a volumeweighted basis kroger’s market share was unchanged 

  

we are in a stronger financial and cash flow position than are many in our industry and even at current earnings we continue to earn more than our cost of capital excluding the effect of labor disputes and the goodwill and asset impairment charges 

  

our plan going forward is to continue sharpening our focus on price and to make further reductions in operating costs we expect those reductions will fund a portion of our price investments our focus on operating costs will include those items traditionally recorded as operating general and administrative “oga” expenses plus certain items included in merchandise costs this focus includes shrink warehousing and transportation costs and advertising costs rent expense and depreciation expense will be targeted for reduction as well 

  

further discussion on our industry the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included below in “outlook” 

  

r estatement of f inancial s tatements 

  

subsequent to the issuance of the our fiscal 2003 consolidated financial statements we reviewed our accounting practices with respect to leasing transactions and determined that our method of accounting for owned buildings on leased properties was not in accordance with sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” as amended and financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 881 “issues related to accounting for leases” and our thencurrent method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 853 “accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases” as a result we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

historically we had not included renewal periods in our determination of the lease term for land leases as defined in sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” as amended we have corrected our lease terms to include periods subject to renewal options that at the inception of the land lease are considered to be reasonably assured of exercise 

  

we generally take possession of leased property prior to the store opening date in order to build andor fixture the store historically we began to record straightline rent expense on the commencement date of the lease or the store opening date rather than on the date we took possession this had the effect of not recognizing rent expense during the period of constructing a building or improvements 

  

the abovenoted corrections resulted in increased rent expense and deferred rent liability including related tax effects these adjustments had no effect on historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases these corrections are further detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2003 compared to 2002 and 2002 compared to 2001 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods including the goodwill and asset impairment charges these items are identified below in “other items” 

  

kroger’s 2003 financial results were adversely affected by labor disputes in southern california and in the west virginia area these disputes which are summarized below adversely affected our sales fifo gross margin as defined below and operating general and administrative expenses our analysis includes estimates of the effects of these disputes on our 2003 results in these areas 

  

labor dispute summary – southern california 

  

safeway inc alberston’s inc and kroger either directly or through their subsidiaries collectively the “retailers” were party to multiemployer bargaining with various local unions affiliated with the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” collectively the “unions” in southern california the retailers and the unions entered into agreements under which a strike against one employer would be deemed a strike against all employers in addition the retailers entered into an agreement among themselves the “agreement” requiring among other things that if one employer were struck the remaining employers would lock out bargaining unit employees the agreement was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others the agreement is more fully described below in “other items” on october 11 2003 the unions initiated a strike against safeway inc on october 12 2003 the other retailers locked out the bargaining unit employees as required by the agreement as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements on february 29 2004 the company announced that it was notified by the ufcw that a new labor contract had been ratified by union members ending a 141day work stoppage 

  

labor dispute summary – west virginia area 

  

on october 13 2003 we temporarily closed 44 kroger stores primarily in west virginia following a decision by a local union of the ufcw that represents workers in those stores to conduct a strike against kroger on december 11 2003 kroger announced that union members had ratified a new labor contract covering employees in these 44 stores we reopened 41 of the stores on december 15 2003 three stores were not reopened 

  

sales 

  

total sales were 538 billion 518 billion and 501 billion for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these sales represented annual increases of 39 in 2003 and 33 in 2002 

  

total food store sales were 511 billion 493 billion and 477 billion for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 

  

we define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters we calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized in the table below 

  

identical food store sales 

in millions 

  

   

we define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations we calculated annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below 

  

comparable food store sales 

in millions 

  

   

   

in southern california sales results were negatively affected by picket lines established outside of our ralphs stores picket lines generally dissuade potential customers from entering our stores additionally we were forced to hire temporary employees and transfer current employees from other areas to southern california to staff the stores operating with fewer employees and in most cases less experienced replacement employees our stores suffered sales losses due to increased inventory shortages decreased customer service and the closure of selected service departments these negative sales effects were partially offset by sales increases at our food 4 less stores in the region that were not involved in the labor dispute also sales at ralphs stores were favorably affected during those weeks when picket lines were removed from ralphs stores 

  

sales figures adjusted for effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes as well as food 4 less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in that region sales were excluded for the last four weeks of our third quarters and the first six weeks of our fourth quarters for stores in the west virginia area sales were excluded for the last five weeks of our third quarters and for our entire fourth quarters for the ralphs and food 4 less stores 

  

our sales in 2003 were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups the weak economy increased competition and the results of our strategic initiatives the estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in “impact of inflation” 

  

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus lastin first out “lifo” charge credit merchandise costs include advertising warehousing and transportation but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates were 2638 2685 and 2739 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these declining rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices the effect of our investment in lower retail prices was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our fifo gross margin rates in 2003 2002 and 2001 because those products carry a higher margin than national brand products other items recorded as merchandise costs in 2003 and 2002 further affected our fifo gross margin rates these items which include estimates of the effects of the labor disputes are described below in “other items” 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs as a percent of sales were 1925 1858 and 1893 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively oga expenses for 2003 were affected by the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described below in “other items” in addition to those items our oga expense rate in 2003 was adversely affected by higher health care benefit and pension costs a portion of the decrease in our rate in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity 

  

initiatives associated with the strategic growth plan that we announced in december 2001 our oga rate declined in 2002 despite increases in our health care benefit costs pension costs and credit card fees 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense as a percent of sales was 122 127 and 131 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decreases in these rates reflect our current strategy on ownership of real estate 

  

depreciation expense 

  

depreciation expense as a percent of sales was 225 210 and 194 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to kroger’s capital investment program and the ownership of real estate 

  

goodwill amortization 

  

in 2001 goodwill amortization expense totaled 103 million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 which became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 goodwill was not amortized beginning in 2002 

  

goodwill impairment charge 

  

our annual impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of 2003 resulted in a goodwill impairment charge related to our smith’s division totaling 444 million details of the charge are included in “other items” 

  

asset impairment charges 

  

asset impairment charges totaling 120 million and 91 million were recorded during 2003 and 2001 the impairments represented writedowns of underperforming stores to estimated fair market values the impairment charges are explained more fully in “other items” 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 604 million 619 million and 648 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in 2003 primarily resulted from lower average borrowings in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease in 2002 when compared to 2001 resulted from lower interest rates on our floatingrate debt in 2002 versus 2001 interest expense in 2003 and 2002 included 18 million and 19 million respectively due to the early retirement of debt 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 593 375 and 391 in 2003 2002 and 2001 the effective rates for 2003 and 2002 differ from the effective rate for 2001 due to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill in 2003 and the amortization of goodwill in 2001 the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 312 million or 041 per diluted share in 2003 these results represent a decrease of approximately 730 from net earnings of 152 per diluted share for 2002 the decrease in net earnings was affected significantly by the labor disputes impairment charges and several other items that are described below in “other items” 

  

net earnings of 152 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 206 over net earnings of 126 per diluted share for 2001 adjusting 2001 results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect as illustrated in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements net earnings would have been 137 per diluted share in 2001 adjusting the 2002 results for the cumulative effect of the accounting change net earnings would have been 154 in 2002 on this basis net earnings of 154 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 124 over net earnings of 137 per diluted share for 2001 

  

o ther i tems 

  

the following table summarizes items that affected kroger’s financial results during the periods presented these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings net cash provided by operating activities or any other generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure of performance or liquidity these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger’s results as reported in accordance with gaap due to the nature of these items as described below it is important to identify these items and review them in conjunction with kroger’s financial results reported in accordance with gaap 

  

these items include a goodwill impairment charge asset impairment charges restructuring charges mergerrelated costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statement of earnings the items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of fifo gross margin lifo charge credit oga expense and interest expense additionally items in 2003 included the estimated effects of the labor disputes 

  

   

   

   

   

items affecting fifo gross margin lifo charge credit and operating general and administrative expense 

  

estimated effect of labor disputes 

  

for disputeaffected regions we assumed that trends existing prior to the effect of the labor disputes would have continued based on those trends the estimated effects included the differences between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the differences between reported oga and oga projections the estimates included differences at strikeaffected stores as well as differences at food 4 less stores in southern california whose financial results were affected by the labor dispute 

  

differences affecting fifo gross margin included incremental warehousing distribution advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses due to the labor disputes differences in oga included direct prestrike expenses costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers costs associated with bringing in employees from other kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis in the ralphs stores and expenses under the agreement 

  

as described above in “results of operations” the agreement entered into in connection with the multiemployer collective bargaining arrangement among the retailers was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others the agreement provided for payments from any of the retailers who gained from such disproportionate pressure to any of the retailers who suffered from such disproportionate pressure based on a percentage of the sales deemed caused by the disproportionate pressure expenses related to the agreement were recorded as oga and totaled approximately 116 million pretax in fiscal 2003 amounts will be paid under the agreement in the first quarter of 2004 

  

furthermore changes in our obligations for health care in the new labor agreement triggered an obligation under our previous southern california labor contract that required us to make a contribution of approximately 31 million pretax to the union’s health and welfare trust fund expenses related to this contribution were recorded as oga in fiscal 2003 the new labor contract also provides for a contract ratification bonus to be paid by the retailers our expenses related to this ratification bonus will be recorded as oga in 2004 both our contribution to the trust fund and the ratification bonus were paid in the first quarter of 2004 

  

itemcost conversion 

  

in 1998 prior to the merger with fred meyer we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the itemcost method the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we adopted the itemcost method for the former fred meyer divisions the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february 3 2002 cannot be determined the effect of the change on the february 3 2002 inventory valuation which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods was included in results for the quarter ended may 25 2002 this change increased merchandise costs by 91 million and reduced net earnings by 57 million we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods the itemcost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on february 3 2002 

  

adoption of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0216 

  

we adopted eitf issue no 0216 during the fourth quarter of 2002 this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory historically we had recognized those allowances as they were earned based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract this accounting treatment was consistent with gaap for all contracts entered into or modified after january 1 2003 we have recognized prospectively and will continue to recognize vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold in accordance with issue 0216 net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of issue no 0216 adoption of the issue resulted in a 28 million pretax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002 this expense was offset by a corresponding 28 million pretax lifo credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002 

  

lease liabilities – store closing plans 

  

in connection with the 2001 asset impairment review described below we recorded pretax oga expenses of 20 million in 2001 for the present value of lease liabilities for the leased stores identified for closure in 2000 we also recorded pretax expenses of 67 million for the present value of lease liabilities for similar store closings the 2000 liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the fred meyer merger or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger that were identified as underperforming stores in both years liabilities were recorded for the planned closings of the stores 

  

due to operational changes performance improved at five stores that had not yet closed as a result of this improved performance in the first quarter of 2003 we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open additionally closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated in total in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded pretax income of 10 million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 

  

no charges were recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the 2003 asset impairment review in accordance with sfas no 146 which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed most of the locations are expected to close during 2004 as a result we expect to record pretax charges totaling approximately 25 million to 32 million during 2004 

  

excess energy purchase commitments 

  

during the third quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax charge of 81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity sfas no 133 required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through currentperiod earnings each quarter we recorded pretax expense of 4 million and pretax income of 19 million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in 2003 and 2002 respectively market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in a pretax charge of 2 million 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in california with dynegy inc related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts the federal energy regulatory commission approved the agreement on july 23 2003 during the third quarter of 2003 we paid 107 million before the related tax benefits to settle disputes with dynegy related to prior overpayments terminate two of the four contracts effective july 6 2003 and terminate the remaining two agreements effective september 1 2003 as a result of the settlement we recorded 62 million of pretax expense in the second quarter of 2003 

  

property tax allowance 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded pretax income of 20 million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual we have determined the amount to be paid will be less than we originally estimated 

  

power outage 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 we recorded a 9 million pretax expense for the august power outage in northwest ohio and michigan the majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses generally we classify uninsured product and property losses as oga expense 

  

adjustment to charitable contribution liability 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 we recorded 5 million of pretax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the fred meyer merger we are required to make these contributions by may 2006 

  

items affecting interest expense 

  

we adopted sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” in the first quarter of 2003 as a result expenses related to the early retirement of debt which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of sfas no 145 are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods the 2003 expenses of 18 million pretax related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of 100 million of longterm bonds and the writeoff of the related deferred financing costs 

goodwill impairment charge 

  

we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by sfas no 142 during the fourth quarter of 2003 this review resulted in a 444 million noncash impairment charge related to the goodwill at our smith’s division the impairment charge which is nondeductible for income tax purposes adjusted the carrying value of the division’s goodwill to its implied fair value in 2003 the smith’s division experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared with 2002 results and budgeted 2003 results additionally we have forecasted a further decline in the future operating performance of this division the decline in expected performance reflects both investments in capital and targeted retail price reductions intended to maintain and grow market share and provide acceptable longterm return on capital no impairment was indicated during this review for goodwill at our other divisions 

  

asset impairment charges and related items 

  

in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we identified impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003 and 2001 these losses which are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” totaled 120 million and 91 million pretax in 2003 and 2001 respectively in both years the impairment reviews were conducted as a consequence of a corporatelevel strategic plan that coordinated the closings of several locations over a relatively short period of time the 2001 charge related to investments by acquired companies in stores opened shortly after the fred meyer merger that did not perform as expected during 2000 and 2001 based on those results and forecasts for 2002 and beyond we performed an impairment review in the third quarter of 2001 that resulted in a pretax charge of 91 million the 2003 charge related to locations whose operating performance deteriorated subsequent to the 2001 review during the fourth quarter of 2003 we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on results for 2002 and 2003 as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond this event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other underperforming locations in the fourth quarter of 2003 the review resulted in a pretax charge totaling 120 million these charges are more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

restructuring charges 

  

on december 11 2001 we outlined our strategic growth plan to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with the plan restructuring charges related to the plan totaled 15 million pretax in 2002 the majority of the 2002 expenses related to severance agreements distribution center consolidation and conversion costs no restructuring charges were recorded in 2003 refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

mergerrelated costs 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we recorded pretax expenses of 1 million and 4 million respectively from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger no mergerrelated costs were recorded in 2003 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

cumulative effect of an accounting change 

  

as noted above in “results of operations” we adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 142 resulted in a 26 million pretax noncash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis rather than on an undiscounted basis as was the standard under sfas no 121 prior to adoption of sfas no 142 we recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of a 10 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2002 

  

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  

in december of 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit of these exercises on march 1 2001 our board authorized the repurchase of an incremental 1 billion of kroger common stock during fiscal 2001 we made open market purchases of 343 million under the 1 billion authorization and 209 million under previous board authorizations during fiscal 2002 we made open market purchases of approximately 657 million to complete the 1 billion program effective december 10 2002 the board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling 500 million we made open market purchases of 277 million and 63 million under this plan in 2003 and 2002 respectively as of april 9 2004 we have repurchased approximately 103 million under 

this program in fiscal 2004 we also reacquired approximately 24 million 65 million and 180 million under the stock option program in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 

  

c apital e xpenditures 

  

capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled 20 billion in 2003 compared to 19 billion in 2002 and 19 billion in 2001 most amounts were used to construct new stores capital expenditures included 202 million 192 million and 76 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

supermarket storing activity 

  

   

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 31 2004 casereserves are established for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as more information becomes known 

  

the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers’ compensation liabilities was 32 million as of january 31 2004 we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in 

  

historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if impairment is identified for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  

we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels generally for reviews performed by local management costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “operating general and administrative” expense cost to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets that result from corporatelevel strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” refer to “other items” for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during 2003 and 2001 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value represents a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2003 and 2002 are summarized in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions however the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets inventory 

  

writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in “merchandise costs” cost to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 

  

benefit plans 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 18 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the discount rate is based primarily on the yield on highquality fixed income investments as of the measurement date we lowered the discount rate to 625 as of january 31 2004 from 675 as of february 1 2003 the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 31 2004 by 110 million in 2004 we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by 11 million as a result of this change 

  

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories we reduced the pension return assumption to 850 for 2003 from 950 for 2002 our pension plan’s average return for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2003 was 96 net of all investment management fees and expenses we believe the reduction in the pension return assumption was appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return we estimate that our 2003 pension expense increased approximately 14 million as a result of the reduction in expected return from 950 to 850 

  

on february 18 2003 we made a cash contribution of 100 million to our pension plans we are required to make a cash contribution of 34 million by september 15 2004 and we intend to contribute an additional 149 million by september 15 2004 we expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years among other things performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  

we also participate in various multiemployer plans for substantially all employees represented by unions we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of service we contributed 169 million 153 million and 114 million to these funds in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we would have contributed an additional 13 million to these plans in 2003 had there been no labor disputes based on the most recent information available to us we believe these multiemployer plans are underfunded the decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided has led to the underfunding as a result we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges two recently completed labor negotiations including southern california resulted in a reduction of liabilities and therefore expected contribution increases these multiemployer funds are managed by trustees appointed by management of the employers including kroger and labor in equal number who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently thus while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds for these reasons it is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multiemployer pension contributions will increase moreover if we were to exit markets we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability any adjustments for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 

  

stock option plans 

  

we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans accordingly because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date no stockbased compensation expense is included in net earnings other than expenses related to restricted stock awards notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation 

  

cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 of inventories for 2003 and approximately 95 of inventories for 2002 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 324 million at january 31 2004 and by 290 million at february 1 2003 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

the itemcost method of accounting is followed for substantially all nonperishable store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the balance sheet date

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 2215 million of cash from operations in 2003 compared to 3183 million in 2002 and 2347 million in 2001 lower earnings including the effect of labor disputes contributed to the decrease in cash provided in 2003 when compared to 2002 conversely increased earnings contributed to the increase in cash provided in 2002 when compared to 2001 

  

changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities during 2003 we realized a 255 million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a 302 million reduction during 2002 and a 161 million increase during 2001 fluctuations in our accounts payable and store deposits intransit balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 and 2002 in 2002 our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position the increase in our store deposits intransit balances in 2003 was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks expected increases in bank fees made the activity noneconomical in 2003 offsetting the changes in our accounts payable and store deposits intransit balances our other current liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the labor disputes discussed in “other items” 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2003 and 2002 was lower than the amount paid in 2001 due in part to a tax law benefit that will continue through 2004 under current tax law the bonus depreciation provision will expire in december 2004 and we expect the cash benefit will begin to reverse in 2005 this provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately 130 million 106 million and 22 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

our 2003 operating cash flow results also reflect a 100 million cash contribution to our companysponsored pension plan 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 2026 million in 2003 compared to 1907 million in 2002 and 1914 million in 2001 the amount of cash used by investing activities in 2003 2002 and 2001 was relatively consistent among the years due to similar levels of capital spending including acquisitions 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 201 million of cash in 2003 compared to 1266 million in 2002 and 433 million in 2001 the decrease in the use of cash in 2003 versus 2002 was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases the decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in 2003 versus 2002 as well as to proceeds received in 2003 from interest rate swap terminations the increase in the use of cash in 2002 versus 2001 was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in 2002 versus 2001 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases decreased 210 million to 84 billion as of yearend 2003 from 86 billion as of yearend 2002 total debt decreased 256 million to 86 billion as of yearend 2002 from 88 billion as of yearend 2001 the decreases in 2003 and 2002 resulted in part from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt approximately 65 million of the decrease experienced in 2003 resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity in prior years we purchased a portion of the debt issued by a mortgagor of certain of our properties to reduce our effective interest expense historically these purchases were classified as investments on our balance sheet these purchases totaled 67 million as of yearend 2002 and 68 million as of yearend 2001 during the fourth quarter of 2003 we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” for this entity and determined that it was required to be consolidated consolidation reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately 65 million refer to “recently issued accounting standards” for further details 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2003 and 2002 and 270 million at yearend 2001 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 104 million as of yearend 2003 and by 110 million as of yearend 2002 the marktomarket adjustments reduced the carrying value of our debt by 18 million as of yearend 2001 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 250 million to 350 million under our a 2 f 2 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbbbbbbaa3 the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities under which we believe we have sufficient capacity borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days 

  

although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

   

   

   

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facilities includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreements are more particularly described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2003 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january 31 2004 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

we are required to make a cash contribution of 34 million to our companysponsored pension plan by september 15 2004 and we intend to contribute an additional 149 million by september 15 2004 we expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years amounts shown in the table for 2005 and 2006 assume that we contribute 183 million by september 15 2004 if we contribute only 34 million by september 15 2004 our minimum required contributions would be 85 million in 2005 and 130 million in 2006 among other things performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions at this time it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2007 and beyond 

  

as described in “other items” we expect to make payments of at least 147 million in 2004 related to the settlement of the labor dispute in southern california additional amounts will be due for 2004 activity 

  

our construction commitments include capital owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 31 2004 we had an 8125 million fiveyear credit agreement a 700 million fiveyear credit agreement and a 1000 million 364day credit agreement the 8125 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 23 2006 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 700 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 22 2007 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 364day facility terminates on may 20 2004 unless extended converted into a oneyear term loan or earlier terminated by kroger at january 31 2004 we also maintained a 75 million money market line in addition to credit agreement borrowings borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under our credit agreements at january 31 2004 these letters of credit totaled 227 million we had no borrowings under the money market line at january 31 2004 the credit agreement borrowings have been classified as longterm borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of facilities we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts accordingly the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 

  

at january 31 2004 we also had a 100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the 25 billion described above funds received under this 100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility as of january 31 2004 we had no borrowings under this additional 100 million facility 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 31 2004 we had available for issuance 15 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june 27 2002 as amended in a filing made on july 18 2002 and declared effective on july 23 2002 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 31 2004 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also guaranteed approximately 5 million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012 

  

at february 1 2003 we were a party to a financing transaction related to 16 properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately 202 million under the terms of the financing transaction which was structured as a synthetic lease a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of kroger the lease had a term of five years which expired on february 28 2003 the owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment the transaction therefore was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense kroger purchased the assets for total costs of 202 million when the lease expired 

  

we are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 

  

i mpact of i nflation 

  

while we believe that kroger’s sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold yeartoyear and other pricing and competitive influences in 2003 we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of 11 compared to product cost deflation of 03 in 2002 we recorded a pretax lifo charge of 34 million in 2003 compared to a pretax lifo credit of 50 million in 2002 including a 28 million pretax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of eitf 0216 in the fourth quarter of 2002

sfas no 132 “employer’s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” was revised by the fasb in december 2003 the revised statement requires new annual disclosures about the types of plan assets investment strategy measurement date plan obligations and cash flows as well as components of the net periodic benefit cost recognized in interim periods the new annual disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 except for the disclosure of expected future benefit payment which must be disclosed for fiscal years ending after june 15 2004 interim period disclosures are generally effective for interim periods beginning after december 15 2003 we have included the disclosures required by sfas no 132 in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

sfas no 143 “asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 this standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs sfas no 143 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” was issued by the fasb in april of 2002 sfas no 145 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 this statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and if material classified as an extraordinary item net of the related income tax effect adoption of sfas no 145 required us to reclassify the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 as interest expense in the respective periods these debt extinguishments were recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 and totaled 19 million of pretax expense pretax expense totaling 18 million related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of 100 million of longterm bonds and the writeoff of the related deferred financing costs was recorded in 2003 

  

fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” was issued by the fasb in january 2003 and revised in december 2003 fin 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for variableinterest entities as defined in the interpretation fin 46 is effective for all variableinterest entities created after january 31 2003 for any variableinterest entities created prior to february 1 2003 fin 46 became effective on february 1 2004 the beginning of our first quarter of 2004 unless earlier adopted except for entities designated as special purpose entities for which the effective date was the fourth quarter of 2003 in the fourth quarter of 2003 we adopted fin 46 for a mortgagor the “mortgagor” of certain of our properties in prior years we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the mortgagor to reduce our effective interest expense these purchases were classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheets consolidation of the mortgagor reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately 65 million consolidation of the mortgagor had an immaterial effect on our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows we continue to review our partnerships joint ventures and other financing arrangements for potential consolidation under this interpretation if we are required to consolidate any other entities in the first quarter of 2004 we anticipate that such consolidation will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 

  

eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers” was issued in november 2003 eitf issue no 0310 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers including manufacturer coupons eitf issue no 0310 became effective for kroger on february 1 2004 the beginning of our first quarter of 2004 we believe the adoption of eitf issue no 0310 will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” was issued by the fasb in january 2004 sfas no 1061 allows for a onetime election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “prescription drug act” the prescription drug act which was signed into law in december 2003 in addition to creating a federal prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans which provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the prescription drug act introduces two new programs to medicare a subsidy to plan sponsors based on 28 of an individual beneficiary’s annual prescription drug costs between 250 and 5000 and a option for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefit under medicare that must be taken into consideration when measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit sfas no 1061 does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effect of the prescription drug act in its financial statements 

  

we have elected to defer adoption of sfas no 1061 due to a lack of specific guidance as such the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact on the plans of the prescription drug act until further specific guidance is provided we will continue to defer adoption of sfas no 1061 authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and when issued may require information previously reported in our consolidated financial statements to change we will continue to investigate the impact of sfas no 1061 initial recognition measurement and disclosure requirements on our consolidated financial statements we do not expect adoption of sfas no 1061 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 31 2004 we maintained 10 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 1825 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between march 2005 and march 2008 variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate “libor” the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

during 2003 we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges approximately 114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt as of january 31 2004 the unamortized balances totaled approximately 98 we also initiated 10 new interest rate swap agreements during 2003 that are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of january 31 2004 assets totaling 6 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these new agreements offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  

as of january 31 2004 we also maintained one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 300 million to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates the agreement which matured in february 2004 involved the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts the variable rate for this agreement was based on us dollar libor the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received was accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreement and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense this agreement was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines in addition our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january 31 2004 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january 31 2004 interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 31 2004 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january 31 2004 refer to notes 9 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

   

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

as noted above in “other items” we recorded a pretax loss of 81 million in the third quarter of 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases normal sales exception we marked the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis through june 2003 during the second quarter of 2003 we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements related to these contracts

the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer together with a disclosure review committee appointed by the chief executive officer evaluated kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation kroger’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of january 31 2004 

  

in connection with the evaluation described above there was no change in kroger’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended january 31 2004 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect kroger’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

in concluding that kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of january 31 2004 the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer considered among other things the deficiency related to accounting for leases which resulted in the need to restate our previously released financial statements taking into consideration that i the restatement adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods taken as a whole ii the cumulative impact of the restatement adjustments on shareowner’s equity was not material on the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods and iii we decided to restate our previously issued financial statements solely because the cumulative impact of the error if recorded in the current period would have been material to the current year’s net income the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded the control deficiency that resulted in the restatement of prior period financial statements was not in itself a material weakness

o perating e nvironment 

  

traditional grocery retailers including kroger have experienced significant business challenges in recent years consumers have remained cautious in their purchases amid concerns about the economy and high unemployment while competition has continued to intensify customers today have a larger number of stores and greater variety of retail formats from which to select these factors have placed pressure on retail prices additionally our company as well as several of our traditional competitors has faced dramatic increases in certain operating costs particularly labor and employee benefit costs in unionized markets 

  

our management team identified these trends more than two years ago and implemented strategic initiatives designed to control costs and offer better value to our customers we have made progress since that time we believe future industry consolidation is likely and presents opportunities for kroger to gain market share and improve financial results as weaker competitors decline in or exit markets and their sales base is picked up by their competitors 

  

kroger has a highquality asset base that holds the 1 or 2 market share in 43 of our 52 major markets with leading market share in many of the nation’s largest and fastestgrowing markets we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores according to our internal share estimates kroger’s share increased in 28 of our 52 major markets in 2003 on a volumeweighted basis kroger’s market share was unchanged 

  

we are in a stronger financial and cash flow position than are many in our industry and even at current earnings we continue to earn more than our cost of capital excluding the effect of labor disputes and the goodwill and asset impairment charges 

  

our plan going forward is to continue sharpening our focus on price and to make further reductions in operating costs we expect those reductions will fund a portion of our price investments our focus on operating costs will include those items traditionally recorded as operating general and administrative “oga” expenses plus certain items included in merchandise costs this focus includes shrink warehousing and transportation costs and advertising costs rent expense and depreciation expense will be targeted for reduction as well 

  

further discussion on our industry the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included below in “outlook” 

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2003 compared to 2002 and 2002 compared to 2001 comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods including the goodwill and asset impairment charges these items are identified below in “other items” 

  

kroger’s 2003 financial results were adversely affected by labor disputes in southern california and in the west virginia area these disputes which are summarized below adversely affected our sales fifo gross margin as defined below and operating general and administrative expenses our analysis includes estimates of the effects of these disputes on our 2003 results in these areas 

  

labor dispute summary – southern california 

  

safeway inc alberston’s inc and kroger either directly or through their subsidiaries collectively the “retailers” were party to multiemployer bargaining with various local unions affiliated with the united food and commercial workers international union “ufcw” collectively the “unions” in southern california the retailers and the unions entered into agreements under which a strike against one employer would be deemed a strike against all employers in addition the retailers entered into an agreement among themselves the “agreement” requiring among other things that if one employer were struck the remaining employers would lock out bargaining unit employees the agreement was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others the agreement is more fully described below in “other items” on october 11 2003 the unions initiated a strike against safeway inc on october 12 2003 the other retailers locked out the bargaining unit employees as required by the agreement as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements on february 29 2004 the company announced that it was notified by the ufcw that a new labor contract had been ratified by union members ending a 141day work stoppage 

  

labor dispute summary – west virginia area 

  

on october 13 2003 we temporarily closed 44 kroger stores primarily in west virginia following a decision by a local union of the ufcw that represents workers in those stores to conduct a strike against kroger on december 11 2003 kroger announced that union members had ratified a new labor contract covering employees in these 44 stores we reopened 41 of the stores on december 15 2003 three stores were not reopened 

  

sales 

  

total sales were 538 billion 518 billion and 501 billion for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these sales represented annual increases of 39 in 2003 and 33 in 2002 

  

total food store sales were 511 billion 493 billion and 477 billion for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 

  

we define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters we calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized in the table below 

  

identical food store sales 

in millions 

  

   

we define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations we calculated annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below 

  

comparable food store sales 

in millions 

  

   

   

in southern california sales results were negatively affected by picket lines established outside of our ralphs stores picket lines generally dissuade potential customers from entering our stores additionally we were forced to hire temporary employees and transfer current employees from other areas to southern california to staff the stores operating with fewer employees and in most cases less experienced replacement employees our stores suffered sales losses due to increased inventory shortages decreased customer service and the closure of selected service departments these negative sales effects were partially offset by sales increases at our food 4 less stores in the region that were not involved in the labor dispute also sales at ralphs stores were favorably affected during those weeks when picket lines were removed from ralphs stores 

  

sales figures adjusted for effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes as well as food 4 less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in that region sales were excluded for the last four weeks of our third quarters and the first six weeks of our fourth quarters for stores in the west virginia area sales were excluded for the last five weeks of our third quarters and for our entire fourth quarters for the ralphs and food 4 less stores 

  

our sales in 2003 were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups the weak economy increased competition and the results of our strategic initiatives the estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in “impact of inflation” 

  

fifo gross margin 

  

we calculate firstin firstout “fifo” gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus lastin first out “lifo” charge credit merchandise costs include advertising warehousing and transportation but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 

  

our fifo gross margin rates were 2638 2685 and 2739 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these declining rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices the effect of our investment in lower retail prices was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our fifo gross margin rates in 2003 2002 and 2001 because those products carry a higher margin than national brand products other items recorded as merchandise costs in 2003 and 2002 further affected our fifo gross margin rates these items which include estimates of the effects of the labor disputes are described below in “other items” 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs as a percent of sales were 1925 1858 and 1893 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively oga expenses for 2003 were affected by the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described below in “other items” in addition to those items our oga expense rate in 2003 was adversely affected by higher health care benefit and pension costs a portion of the decrease in our rate in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity 

  

initiatives associated with the strategic growth plan that we announced in december 2001 our oga rate declined in 2002 despite increases in our health care benefit costs pension costs and credit card fees 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense as a percent of sales was 121 127 and 130 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decreases in these rates reflect our current strategy on ownership of real estate 

  

depreciation expense 

  

depreciation expense as a percent of sales was 225 210 and 194 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to kroger’s capital investment program and the ownership of real estate 

  

goodwill amortization 

  

in 2001 goodwill amortization expense totaled 103 million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 which became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 goodwill was not amortized beginning in 2002 

  

goodwill impairment charge 

  

our annual impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of 2003 resulted in a goodwill impairment charge related to our smith’s division totaling 444 million details of the charge are included in “other items” 

  

asset impairment charges 

  

asset impairment charges totaling 120 million and 91 million were recorded during 2003 and 2001 the impairments represented writedowns of underperforming stores to estimated fair market values the impairment charges are explained more fully in “other items” 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 604 million 619 million and 648 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in 2003 primarily resulted from lower average borrowings in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease in 2002 when compared to 2001 resulted from lower interest rates on our floatingrate debt in 2002 versus 2001 interest expense in 2003 and 2002 included 18 million and 19 million respectively due to the early retirement of debt 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 591 375 and 391 in 2003 2002 and 2001 the effective rates for 2003 and 2002 differ from the effective rate for 2001 due to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill in 2003 and the amortization of goodwill in 2001 the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 315 million or 042 per diluted share in 2003 these results represent a decrease of approximately 724 from net earnings of 152 per diluted share for 2002 the decrease in net earnings was affected significantly by the labor disputes impairment charges and several other items that are described below in “other items” 

  

net earnings of 152 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 206 over net earnings of 126 per diluted share for 2001 adjusting 2001 results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect as illustrated in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements net earnings would have been 137 per diluted share in 2001 adjusting the 2002 results for the cumulative effect of the accounting change net earnings would have been 154 in 2002 on this basis net earnings of 154 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 124 over net earnings of 137 per diluted share for 2001 

  

o ther i tems 

  

the following table summarizes items that affected kroger’s financial results during the periods presented these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings net cash provided by operating activities or any other generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure of performance or liquidity these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger’s results as reported in accordance with gaap due to the nature of these items as described below it is important to identify these items and review them in conjunction with kroger’s financial results reported in accordance with gaap 

  

these items include a goodwill impairment charge asset impairment charges restructuring charges mergerrelated costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statement of earnings the items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of fifo gross margin lifo charge credit oga expense and interest expense additionally items in 2003 included the estimated effects of the labor disputes 

  

   

   

   

   

items affecting fifo gross margin lifo charge credit and operating general and administrative expense 

  

estimated effect of labor disputes 

  

for disputeaffected regions we assumed that trends existing prior to the effect of the labor disputes would have continued based on those trends the estimated effects included the differences between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the differences between reported oga and oga projections the estimates included differences at strikeaffected stores as well as differences at food 4 less stores in southern california whose financial results were affected by the labor dispute 

  

differences affecting fifo gross margin included incremental warehousing distribution advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses due to the labor disputes differences in oga included direct prestrike expenses costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers costs associated with bringing in employees from other kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis in the ralphs stores and expenses under the agreement 

  

as described above in “results of operations” the agreement entered into in connection with the multiemployer collective bargaining arrangement among the retailers was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others the agreement provided for payments from any of the retailers who gained from such disproportionate pressure to any of the retailers who suffered from such disproportionate pressure based on a percentage of the sales deemed caused by the disproportionate pressure expenses related to the agreement were recorded as oga and totaled approximately 116 million pretax in fiscal 2003 amounts will be paid under the agreement in the first quarter of 2004 

  

furthermore changes in our obligations for health care in the new labor agreement triggered an obligation under our previous southern california labor contract that required us to make a contribution of approximately 31 million pretax to the union’s health and welfare trust fund expenses related to this contribution were recorded as oga in fiscal 2003 the new labor contract also provides for a contract ratification bonus to be paid by the retailers our expenses related to this ratification bonus will be recorded as oga in 2004 both our contribution to the trust fund and the ratification bonus were paid in the first quarter of 2004 

  

itemcost conversion 

  

in 1998 prior to the merger with fred meyer we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the itemcost method the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we adopted the itemcost method for the former fred meyer divisions the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february 3 2002 cannot be determined the effect of the change on the february 3 2002 inventory valuation which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods was included in results for the quarter ended may 25 2002 this change increased merchandise costs by 91 million and reduced net earnings by 57 million we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods the itemcost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on february 3 2002 

  

adoption of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0216 

  

we adopted eitf issue no 0216 during the fourth quarter of 2002 this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory historically we had recognized those allowances as they were earned based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract this accounting treatment was consistent with gaap for all contracts entered into or modified after january 1 2003 we have recognized prospectively and will continue to recognize vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold in accordance with issue 0216 net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of issue no 0216 adoption of the issue resulted in a 28 million pretax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002 this expense was offset by a corresponding 28 million pretax lifo credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002 

  

lease liabilities – store closing plans 

  

in connection with the 2001 asset impairment review described below we recorded pretax oga expenses of 20 million in 2001 for the present value of lease liabilities for the leased stores identified for closure in 2000 we also recorded pretax expenses of 67 million for the present value of lease liabilities for similar store closings the 2000 liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the fred meyer merger or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger that were identified as underperforming stores in both years liabilities were recorded for the planned closings of the stores 

  

due to operational changes performance improved at five stores that had not yet closed as a result of this improved performance in the first quarter of 2003 we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open additionally closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated in total in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded pretax income of 10 million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 

  

no charges were recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the 2003 asset impairment review in accordance with sfas no 146 which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed most of the locations are expected to close during 2004 as a result we expect to record pretax charges totaling approximately 25 million to 32 million during 2004 

  

excess energy purchase commitments 

  

during the third quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax charge of 81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity sfas no 133 required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through currentperiod earnings each quarter we recorded pretax expense of 4 million and pretax income of 19 million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in 2003 and 2002 respectively market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in a pretax charge of 2 million 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in california with dynegy inc related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts the federal energy regulatory commission approved the agreement on july 23 2003 during the third quarter of 2003 we paid 107 million before the related tax benefits to settle disputes with dynegy related to prior overpayments terminate two of the four contracts effective july 6 2003 and terminate the remaining two agreements effective september 1 2003 as a result of the settlement we recorded 62 million of pretax expense in the second quarter of 2003 

  

property tax allowance 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded pretax income of 20 million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual we have determined the amount to be paid will be less than we originally estimated 

  

power outage 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 we recorded a 9 million pretax expense for the august power outage in northwest ohio and michigan the majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses generally we classify uninsured product and property losses as oga expense

in the second quarter of 2003 we recorded 5 million of pretax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the fred meyer merger we are required to make these contributions by may 2006 

  

items affecting interest expense 

  

we adopted sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” in the first quarter of 2003 as a result expenses related to the early retirement of debt which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of sfas no 145 are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods the 2003 expenses of 18 million pretax related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of 100 million of longterm bonds and the writeoff of the related deferred financing costs 

goodwill impairment charge 

  

we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by sfas no 142 during the fourth quarter of 2003 this review resulted in a 444 million noncash impairment charge related to the goodwill at our smith’s division the impairment charge which is nondeductible for income tax purposes adjusted the carrying value of the division’s goodwill to its implied fair value in 2003 the smith’s division experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared with 2002 results and budgeted 2003 results additionally we have forecasted a further decline in the future operating performance of this division the decline in expected performance reflects both investments in capital and targeted retail price reductions intended to maintain and grow market share and provide acceptable longterm return on capital no impairment was indicated during this review for goodwill at our other divisions 

  

asset impairment charges and related items 

  

in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets we identified impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003 and 2001 these losses which are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” totaled 120 million and 91 million pretax in 2003 and 2001 respectively in both years the impairment reviews were conducted as a consequence of a corporatelevel strategic plan that coordinated the closings of several locations over a relatively short period of time the 2001 charge related to investments by acquired companies in stores opened shortly after the fred meyer merger that did not perform as expected during 2000 and 2001 based on those results and forecasts for 2002 and beyond we performed an impairment review in the third quarter of 2001 that resulted in a pretax charge of 91 million the 2003 charge related to locations whose operating performance deteriorated subsequent to the 2001 review during the fourth quarter of 2003 we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on results for 2002 and 2003 as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond this event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other underperforming locations in the fourth quarter of 2003 the review resulted in a pretax charge totaling 120 million these charges are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

restructuring charges 

  

on december 11 2001 we outlined our strategic growth plan to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with the plan restructuring charges related to the plan totaled 15 million pretax in 2002 the majority of the 2002 expenses related to severance agreements distribution center consolidation and conversion costs no restructuring charges were recorded in 2003 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

mergerrelated costs 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we recorded pretax expenses of 1 million and 4 million respectively from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger no mergerrelated costs were recorded in 2003 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

cumulative effect of an accounting change 

  

as noted above in “results of operations” we adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 142 resulted in a 26 million pretax noncash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis rather than on an undiscounted basis as was the standard under sfas no 121 prior to adoption of sfas no 142 we recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of a 10 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2002 

  

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  

in december of 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit of these exercises on march 1 2001 our board authorized the repurchase of an incremental 1 billion of kroger common stock during fiscal 2001 we made open market purchases of 343 million under the 1 billion authorization and 209 million under previous board authorizations during fiscal 2002 we made open market purchases of approximately 657 million to complete the 1 billion program effective december 10 2002 the board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling 500 million we made open market purchases of 277 million and 63 million under this plan in 2003 and 2002 respectively as of april 9 2004 we have repurchased approximately 103 million under 

this program in fiscal 2004 we also reacquired approximately 24 million 65 million and 180 million under the stock option program in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 

  

c apital e xpenditures 

  

capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled 20 billion in 2003 compared to 19 billion in 2002 and 19 billion in 2001 most amounts were used to construct new stores capital expenditures included 202 million 192 million and 76 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 31 2004 casereserves are established for reported claims using casebasis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as more information becomes known 

  

the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers’ compensation liabilities was 32 million as of january 31 2004 we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in 

  

historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if impairment is identified for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 

  

the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  

we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels generally for reviews performed by local management costs to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “operating general and administrative” expense cost to reduce the carrying value of longlived assets that result from corporatelevel strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” refer to “other items” for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during 2003 and 2001 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value represents a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2003 and 2002 are summarized in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results similar to our policy on impairment of longlived assets the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation the economy and market competition 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  

we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions however the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of longlived assets inventory 

  

writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in “merchandise costs” cost to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 

  

benefit plans 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for companysponsored pension plans and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 18 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the discount rate is based primarily on the yield on highquality fixed income investments as of the measurement date we lowered the discount rate to 625 as of january 31 2004 from 675 as of february 1 2003 the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january 31 2004 by 110 million in 2004 we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by 11 million as a result of this change 

  

to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories we reduced the pension return assumption to 850 for 2003 from 950 for 2002 our pension plan’s average return for the 10 calendar years ended december 31 2003 was 96 net of all investment management fees and expenses we believe the reduction in the pension return assumption was appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return we estimate that our 2003 pension expense increased approximately 14 million as a result of the reduction in expected return from 950 to 850 

  

on february 18 2003 we made a cash contribution of 100 million to our pension plans we are required to make a cash contribution of 34 million by september 15 2004 and we intend to contribute an additional 149 million by september 15 2004 we expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years among other things performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 

  

we also participate in various multiemployer plans for substantially all employees represented by unions we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of service we contributed 169 million 153 million and 114 million to these funds in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we would have contributed an additional 13 million to these plans in 2003 had there been no labor disputes based on the most recent information available to us we believe these multiemployer plans are underfunded the decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided has led to the underfunding as a result we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges two recently completed labor negotiations including southern california resulted in a reduction of liabilities and therefore expected contribution increases these multiemployer funds are managed by trustees appointed by management of the employers including kroger and labor in equal number who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently thus while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds for these reasons it is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multiemployer pension contributions will increase moreover if we were to exit markets we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability any adjustments for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 

  

stock option plans 

  

we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans accordingly because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date no stockbased compensation expense is included in net earnings other than expenses related to restricted stock awards notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation 

  

cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 97 of inventories for 2003 and approximately 95 of inventories for 2002 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 324 million at january 31 2004 and by 290 million at february 1 2003 we follow the linkchain dollarvalue lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 

  

the itemcost method of accounting is followed for substantially all nonperishable store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold the itemcost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the balance sheet date

cash flow information 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

we generated 2215 million of cash from operations in 2003 compared to 3183 million in 2002 and 2347 million in 2001 lower earnings including the effect of labor disputes contributed to the decrease in cash provided in 2003 when compared to 2002 conversely increased earnings contributed to the increase in cash provided in 2002 when compared to 2001 

  

changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities during 2003 we realized a 260 million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a 299 million reduction during 2002 and a 166 million increase during 2001 fluctuations in our accounts payable balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 and 2002 in 2002 our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position the decrease in our accounts payable balances in 2003 was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks the cost of this activity was minimal in 2002 expected increases in bank fees made the activity noneconomical in 2003 offsetting the changes in our accounts payable balances our other current liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the labor disputes discussed in “other items” 

  

the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2003 and 2002 was lower than the amount paid in 2001 due in part to a tax law benefit that will continue through 2004 under current tax law the bonus depreciation provision will expire in december 2004 and we expect the cash benefit will begin to reverse in 2005 this provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately 130 million 106 million and 22 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

our 2003 operating cash flow results also reflect a 100 million cash contribution to our companysponsored pension plan 

  

net cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 2026 million in 2003 compared to 1907 million in 2002 and 1914 million in 2001 the amount of cash used by investing activities in 2003 2002 and 2001 was relatively consistent among the years due to similar levels of capital spending including acquisitions 

  

net cash used by financing activities 

  

financing activities used 201 million of cash in 2003 compared to 1266 million in 2002 and 433 million in 2001 the decrease in the use of cash in 2003 versus 2002 was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases the decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in 2003 versus 2002 as well as to proceeds received in 2003 from interest rate swap terminations the increase in the use of cash in 2002 versus 2001 was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in 2002 versus 2001 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases decreased 210 million to 84 billion as of yearend 2003 from 86 billion as of yearend 2002 total debt decreased 256 million to 86 billion as of yearend 2002 from 88 billion as of yearend 2001 the decreases in 2003 and 2002 resulted in part from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt approximately 65 million of the decrease experienced in 2003 resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity in prior years we purchased a portion of the debt issued by a mortgagor of certain of our properties to reduce our effective interest expense historically these purchases were classified as investments on our balance sheet these purchases totaled 67 million as of yearend 2002 and 68 million as of yearend 2001 during the fourth quarter of 2003 we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” for this entity and determined that it was required to be consolidated consolidation reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately 65 million refer to “recently issued accounting standards” for further details 

  

our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 we had prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2003 and 2002 and 270 million at yearend 2001 the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by 104 million as of yearend 2003 and by 110 million as of yearend 2002 the marktomarket adjustments reduced the carrying value of our debt by 18 million as of yearend 2001 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 250 million to 350 million under our a 2 f 2 rated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbbbbbbaa3 the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities under which we believe we have sufficient capacity borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days 

  

although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our “financial covenants” a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities these financial covenants and ratios are described below 

  

   

   

   

consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facilities includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses our credit agreements are more particularly described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at yearend 2003 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january 31 2004 in millions of dollars 

  

   

   

we are required to make a cash contribution of 34 million to our companysponsored pension plan by september 15 2004 and we intend to contribute an additional 149 million by september 15 2004 we expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years amounts shown in the table for 2005 and 2006 assume that we contribute 183 million by september 15 2004 if we contribute only 34 million by september 15 2004 our minimum required contributions would be 85 million in 2005 and 130 million in 2006 among other things performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions at this time it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2007 and beyond 

  

as described in “other items” we expect to make payments of at least 147 million in 2004 related to the settlement of the labor dispute in southern california additional amounts will be due for 2004 activity 

  

our construction commitments include capital owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

as of january 31 2004 we had an 8125 million fiveyear credit agreement a 700 million fiveyear credit agreement and a 1000 million 364day credit agreement the 8125 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 23 2006 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 700 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 22 2007 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 364day facility terminates on may 20 2004 unless extended converted into a oneyear term loan or earlier terminated by kroger at january 31 2004 we also maintained a 75 million money market line in addition to credit agreement borrowings borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under our credit agreements at january 31 2004 these letters of credit totaled 227 million we had no borrowings under the money market line at january 31 2004 the credit agreement borrowings have been classified as longterm borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of facilities we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts accordingly the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 

  

at january 31 2004 we also had a 100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the 25 billion described above funds received under this 100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility as of january 31 2004 we had no borrowings under this additional 100 million facility 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january 31 2004 we had available for issuance 15 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june 27 2002 as amended in a filing made on july 18 2002 and declared effective on july 23 2002 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 7 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january 31 2004 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also guaranteed approximately 5 million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012 

  

at february 1 2003 we were a party to a financing transaction related to 16 properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately 202 million under the terms of the financing transaction which was structured as a synthetic lease a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of kroger the lease had a term of five years which expired on february 28 2003 the owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment the transaction therefore was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense kroger purchased the assets for total costs of 202 million when the lease expired 

  

we are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 

  

i mpact of i nflation 

  

while we believe that kroger’s sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold yeartoyear and other pricing and competitive influences in 2003 we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of 11 compared to product cost deflation of 03 in 2002 we recorded a pretax lifo charge of 34 million in 2003 compared to a pretax lifo credit of 50 million in 2002 including a 28 million pretax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of eitf 0216 in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

r ecently i ssued a ccounting s tandards 

  

sfas no 132 “employer’s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” was revised by the fasb in december 2003 the revised statement requires new annual disclosures about the types of plan assets investment strategy measurement date plan obligations and cash flows as well as components of the net periodic benefit cost recognized in interim periods the new annual disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 except for the disclosure of expected future benefit payment which must be disclosed for fiscal years ending after june 15 2004 interim period disclosures are generally effective for interim periods beginning after december 15 2003 we have included the disclosures required by sfas no 132 in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

sfas no 143 “asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 this standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs sfas no 143 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” was issued by the fasb in april of 2002 sfas no 145 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 this statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and if material classified as an extraordinary item net of the related income tax effect adoption of sfas no 145 required us to reclassify the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 as interest expense in the respective periods these debt extinguishments were recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 and totaled 19 million of pretax expense pretax expense totaling 18 million related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of 100 million of longterm bonds and the writeoff of the related deferred financing costs was recorded in 2003 

  

fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” was issued by the fasb in january 2003 and revised in december 2003 fin 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for variableinterest entities as defined in the interpretation fin 46 is effective for all variableinterest entities created after january 31 2003 for any variableinterest entities created prior to february 1 2003 fin 46 became effective on february 1 2004 the beginning of our first quarter of 2004 unless earlier adopted except for entities designated as special purpose entities for which the effective date was the fourth quarter of 2003 in the fourth quarter of 2003 we adopted fin 46 for a mortgagor the “mortgagor” of certain of our properties in prior years we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the mortgagor to reduce our effective interest expense these purchases were classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheets consolidation of the mortgagor reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately 65 million consolidation of the mortgagor had an immaterial effect on our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows we continue to review our partnerships joint ventures and other financing arrangements for potential consolidation under this interpretation if we are required to consolidate any other entities in the first quarter of 2004 we anticipate that such consolidation will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 

  

eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers” was issued in november 2003 eitf issue no 0310 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers including manufacturer coupons eitf issue no 0310 became effective for kroger on february 1 2004 the beginning of our first quarter of 2004 we believe the adoption of eitf issue no 0310 will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” was issued by the fasb in january 2004 sfas no 1061 allows for a onetime election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “prescription drug act” the prescription drug act which was signed into law in december 2003 in addition to creating a federal prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans which provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the prescription drug act introduces two new programs to medicare a subsidy to plan sponsors based on 28 of an individual beneficiary’s annual prescription drug costs between 250 and 5000 and a option for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefit under medicare that must be taken into consideration when measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit sfas no 1061 does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effect of the prescription drug act in its financial statements 

  

we have elected to defer adoption of sfas no 1061 due to a lack of specific guidance as such the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact on the plans of the prescription drug act until further specific guidance is provided we will continue to defer adoption of sfas no 1061 authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and when issued may require information previously reported in our consolidated financial statements to change we will continue to investigate the impact of sfas no 1061 initial recognition measurement and disclosure requirements on our consolidated financial statements we do not expect adoption of sfas no 1061 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 25 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of january 31 2004 we maintained 10 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 1825 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates these agreements mature at varying times between march 2005 and march 2008 variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate “libor” the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

during 2003 we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges approximately 114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt as of january 31 2004 the unamortized balances totaled approximately 98 we also initiated 10 new interest rate swap agreements during 2003 that are being accounted for as fair value hedges as of january 31 2004 assets totaling 6 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these new agreements offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 

  

as of january 31 2004 we also maintained one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 300 million to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates the agreement which matured in february 2004 involved the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts the variable rate for this agreement was based on us dollar libor the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received was accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreement and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense this agreement was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines in addition our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january 31 2004 the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january 31 2004 interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 31 2004 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january 31 2004 refer to notes 8 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

   

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

as noted above in “other items” we recorded a pretax loss of 81 million in the third quarter of 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases normal sales exception we marked the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis through june 2003 during the second quarter of 2003 we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements related to these contracts

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 

operations 

  

r esults of o perations 

  

the following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2002 compared to 2001 and 2001 compared to 2000 however 2002 results are not directly comparable to 2001 results and 2001 results are not directly comparable to 2000 results due to a 53week year in 2000 and the effects of acquisitions in all years presented 

  

sales 

  

total sales were 518 billion 501 billion and 490 billion for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these sales represented annual increases of 33 in 2002 and 22 in 2001 excluding 919 million of sales to adjust for the estimated effect of a 53 rd week of sales in 2000 the annual increase in 2001 would have been 42 

  

total food store sales were 493 billion 477 billion and 465 billion for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively fiscal 2000 results include approximately 877 million of sales from a 53 rd week in 2000 the differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions as well as to sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 

  

we define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters identical food store sales as used to calculate each respective year’s percent change in identical food store sales were 460 billion and 443 billion for 2002 and 2001 respectively identical food store sales were flat in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 09 in 2001 over 2000 we define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations comparable food store sales as used to calculate each respective year’s percent change in comparable food store sales were 474 billion and 457 billion for 2002 and 2001 respectively comparable food store sales increased 08 in 2002 over 2001 and increased 15 in 2001 over 2000 identical and comparable food store sales exclude the estimated effect of a 53 rd week of sales in 2000 the differences between total food store sales adjusted for the 53 rd week in 2000 and identical food store sales were primarily due to the increases in food store square footage as discussed below in “capital expenditures” 

  

the increase in the percent of total sales attributable to sales at supermarket fuel centers has significantly impacted our results at the end of 2002 we operated 376 supermarket fuel centers compared to 227 and 77 supermarket fuel centers at the end of 2001 and 2000 respectively excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers identical food store sales decreased 07 in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 04 in 2001 over 2000 on the same basis comparable food store sales were flat in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 09 in 2001 over 2000 

  

our sales in 2002 were also affected by deflation in various commodity groups the weak economy war fears increased competition and the results of our strategic growth plan “plan” the estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in “impact of inflation” we believe the effects of the weak economy and increased competition partially offset the benefits from kroger’s price reductions associated with the plan in 2002 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit rates were 2695 2735 and 2693 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we recorded a lastin firstout “lifo” credit of 50 million in 2002 compared to a lifo charge of 23 million in 2001 and a lifo credit of 6 million in 2000 excluding these lifo credits and charges our gross profit rates were 2685 2739 and 2692 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices as part of the plan in 2002 the effect of our investment in the plan was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities the increase in our gross profit rate in 2001 versus 2000 partially resulted from similar decreases in product costs improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our gross profit rates in both 2002 and 2001 the increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in 2002 versus 2001 reduced the gross profit rate by approximately 17 basis points in 2002 versus 2001 and by approximately 15 basis points in 2001 versus 2000 supermarket fuel center sales have a negative impact on our overall gross profit rate due to the relatively low gross profit rate on fuel sales some significant items recorded as merchandise costs in 2002 2001 and 2000 further affected our gross profit rates these items are described below in “significant items” 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrative “oga” expenses which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs as a percent of sales were 1858 1893 and 1868 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in 2002 versus 2001 reduced our overall oga expense rate by approximately 11 points in 2002 versus 2001 and by approximately 10 basis points in 2001 versus 2000 supermarket fuel center sales have a positive impact on our overall oga expense rate due to the relatively low overhead costs associated with fuel sales a portion of the decrease in our oga expense rate in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives associated with the strategic growth plan that we announced in december 2001 our oga rates declined in 2002 despite increases in our health care benefit costs pension costs and credit card fees health care benefits costs pension costs and credit card fees as a percent of sales increased approximately 15 basis points nine basis points and five basis points respectively in 2002 versus 2001 the increase in our oga rate in 2001 versus 2000 was also due to higher health care benefit costs and credit card fees additionally utility costs increased as a percent of sales in 2001 versus 2000 some significant items recorded as operating general and administrative expense in 2002 2001 and 2000 further affected our rates these items are described below in “significant items” 

  

rent expense 

  

rent expense as a percent of sales was 127 130 and 132 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decreases in these rates reflect the emphasis our current growth strategy places on ownership of real estate 

  

depreciation expense 

  

depreciation expense totaled 1087 million 973 million and 907 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to kroger’s capital investment program and the emphasis on ownership of real estate 

  

goodwill amortization 

  

in 2001 and 2000 goodwill amortization expense totaled 103 million and 101 million respectively in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 which became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 goodwill was not amortized in 2002 refer to “critical accounting policies” for a discussion of kroger’s annual evaluation of the carrying amount of goodwill 

  

interest expense 

  

net interest expense totaled 600 million 648 million and 675 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these decreases resulted from lower interest rates on our floatingrate debt in 2002 versus 2001 and in 2001 versus 2000 net interest expense also decreased in 2002 due to an overall reduction of outstanding debt in 2002 versus 2001 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 375 391 and 416 in 2002 2001 and 2000 the effective income tax rates differ from the expected statutory rate primarily because of the effect of state taxes the effective rate for 2002 also differs from the effective rate for 2001 and 2000 due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill in 2002 the effective rate for 2000 was also affected by the writeoff of nondeductible goodwill in 2000 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings totaled 12 billion or 152 per diluted share in 2002 these results represent an increase of approximately 206 over net earnings of 126 per diluted share for 2001 as described above goodwill amortization expense totaled 103 million pretax in 2001 but goodwill was not amortized in 2002 adjusting 2001 results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect as illustrated in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements net earnings would have been 137 per diluted share in 2001 on this basis net earnings of 152 per diluted share for 2002 represent an increase of approximately 109 over net earnings of 137 per diluted share for 2001 

  

net earnings of 126 per diluted share for 2001 represent an increase of approximately 212 over net earnings of 104 per diluted share for 2000 adjusting results in both years to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect as illustrated in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements net earnings would have been 137 per diluted share in 2001 an increase of 191 over net earnings of 115 per diluted share in 2000

the following table summarizes items that significantly affected kroger’s financial results during 2002 2001 and 2000 these items include asset impairment charges restructuring charges mergerrelated costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statements of earnings the items also include other charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and operating general and administrative expense the items totaled 87 million 174 million and 250 million of net aftertax expense in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

    

significant items in merchandise costs and in operating general and administrative expense 

  

costs related to mergers 

  

costs related to mergers included expenses recognized as a consequence of the continued integration of the company’s divisions integration primarily resulted from the company’s merger with fred meyer these expenses primarily related to severance agreements enterprise system and banner conversions and inventory writedowns 

  

itemcost conversion 

  

in 1998 prior to the merger with fred meyer we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the itemcost method the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimation inherent in the retail method 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we adopted the itemcost method for the former fred meyer divisions the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february 3 2002 cannot be determined the effect of the change on the february 3 2002 inventory valuation which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods was included in restated results for the quarter ended may 25 2002 this change increased merchandise costs by 91 million and reduced net earnings by 57 million we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because cost information for these periods was not determinable the itemcost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on february 3 2002 

  

adoption of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0216 

  

as described below in “recently issued accounting standards” we adopted eitf issue no 0216 during the fourth quarter of 2002 this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances as a result we recorded a pretax charge of 28 million this expense was offset by a corresponding pretax lifo credit of 28 million 

  

lease liabilities—store closing plans 

  

in 2001 and 2000 we recorded pretax expenses of 20 million and 67 million respectively for the present value of lease liabilities related to store closings sales at stores considered in these charges totaled 186 million 236 million and 377 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively net operating income or loss from these stores cannot be determined on a separately identifiable basis these liabilities were the result of two distinct formalized plans that coordinated the closings of several locations over relatively short periods of time the liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the fred meyer merger or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger that were identified as underperforming stores therefore liabilities were recorded for the anticipated closings of the stores due to the ongoing consolidation in our industry certain stores remained open to determine if performance could be improved final determination regarding these stores will be made in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 

  

excess energy purchase commitments 

  

during the third quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax charge of 81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity sfas no 133 requires the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through currentperiod earnings each quarter in 2002 we recorded net pretax income of 19 million as a result of the market value adjustments of these excess commitments market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in a pretax charge of 2 million refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and to our discussion of commodity price protection below in “liquidity and capital resources” for additional details of these liabilities 

  

asset impairment charges 

  

during 2001 and 2000 we recorded pretax impairment charges of 91 million and 191 million respectively in 2000 we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for 2000 and beyond in 2001 we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for 2002 and beyond in both years we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and for assets to be held and used in 2000 we also identified impairment losses for investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased the 2001 charge related to locations that either had not opened or had only recently opened when the 2000 impairment charge was performed as a result estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time no asset impairment charges were recorded in 2002 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

restructuring charges 

  

on december 11 2001 we outlined our strategic growth plan to support additional investment in core business to increase sales and market share in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with the plan restructuring charges related to the plan totaled 15 million pretax in 2002 the majority of the 2002 expenses related to severance agreements and distribution center consolidation and conversion costs refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

mergerrelated costs 

  

during 2002 2001 and 2000 we recorded net pretax expenses of 1 million 4 million and 10 million respectively from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger our mergerrelated costs in 2000 also included 5 million of severance expense refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 

  

cumulative effect of an accounting change 

  

as noted above in “results of operations” we adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 142 resulted in a 26 million pretax noncash loss to writeoff the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis rather than on an undiscounted basis as was the standard under sfas no 121 prior to adoption of sfas no 142 this loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of a 10 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2002 for further details of this charge refer to our discussion of sfas no 142 in “recently issued accounting standards” 

  

c ommon s tock r epurchase p rogram 

  

in december of 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit in january of 2000 the board of directors “board” authorized an additional repurchase of up to 100 million of common stock on march 31 2000 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 750 million of kroger common stock this repurchase program replaced the 100 million program authorized in january of 2000 during fiscal 2000 we made open market purchases of approximately 43 million under the stock option program and 539 million under the 750 million program on march 1 2001 the board authorized the repurchase of an incremental 1 billion of kroger common stock this repurchase program was in addition to the 750 million stock buyback authorized in 2000 during fiscal 2001 we made open market purchases of approximately 180 million under the stock option program and 209 million to complete the 750 million program we also made open market purchases of 343 million under the 1 billion authorization during fiscal 2002 we made open market purchases of approximately 657 million to complete the 1 billion program effective december 10 2002 the board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling 500 million we made open market purchases of 63 million under this plan in 2002 we also reacquired approximately 71 million under the stock option program in fiscal 2002 purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 

  

c apital e xpenditures 

  

capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled 19 billion in 2002 compared to 19 billion in 2001 and 16 billion in 2000 most amounts were used to construct new stores capital expenditures in 2002 included 192 million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage 

  

   

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner the significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

selfinsurance costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

impairments of longlived assets 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if impairment is identified for longlived assets to be held and used we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” 

  

goodwill 

  

we adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 accordingly goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value represents a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value for details of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2002 refer to our discussion of sfas no 142 in “recently issued accounting standards” 

  

the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the anticipated closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years for owned stores that we intend to sell we actively market the stores to potential buyers owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect estimated recoverable values we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions however the ultimate cost of the disposition of these leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that the settlement is determined other costs related to individual operational store closings initiated by local divisional management including costs to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “operating general and administrative” costs reductions in the carrying value of property and equipment related to stores closed in connection with a corporatelevel strategic plan are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as “asset impairment charges” in accordance with our policy on impairments of longlived assets inventory writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in “merchandise costs” costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  

as noted below in “recently issued accounting standards” sfas no 146 became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 all closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 have been and will continue to be accounted for accordingly 

  

purchase commitments 

  

occasionally we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices upon entering into these commitments and on a quarterly basis thereafter we evaluate our expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

benefit plans 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense note 18 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

the discount rate was lowered to 675 as of february 1 2003 from 725 as of february 2 2002 the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the pension projected benefit obligation as of february 1 2003 by 1043 million in 2003 we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by 47 million as a result of this change 

  

we also reduced the compensation increase assumption to 350 as of february 1 2003 from 375 as of february 2 2002 the 25 basis point reduction in the compensation increase assumption reduced the pension projected benefit obligation as of february 1 2003 by 119 million in 2003 we expect that the annual pension expense will decrease by 16 million as a result of this change 

  

we intend to reduce the pension return assumption of 950 for 2002 to 850 for 2003 our pension plan’s average annual return for the 10 fiscal years ending february 1 2003 was 1000 net of all fees and expenses we believe the reduction in the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return beginning in fiscal 2003 we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by 140 million as a result of the reduction in expected return from 950 to 850 in addition we are adding an assumption for nonasset related expenses paid out of the trust this assumption will add 40 million to the annual pension expense 

  

on february 18 2003 we made a cash contribution of 100 million to our pension plans approximately 50 of this contribution was required minimum funding for 2002 that was not required to be funded until september of 2003 the remaining 50 of the contribution was discretionary 

  

we also participate in various multiemployer plans for substantially all union employees we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service a decline in the value of assets held by these plans caused by performance of the investments in the financial markets in recent years is likely to result in higher contributions to these plans and to create challenges in our collective bargaining moreover if we exit markets we may be required to pay a potential withdrawal liability if the plans were underfunded at the time of withdrawal however we are unable to determine the amount of potential liability at this time any adjustments will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it is determined that markets will be exited 

  

stock option plans 

  

we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans accordingly because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date no stockbased compensation expense is included in net earnings other than expenses related to restricted stock awards notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately 95 of inventories for 2002 and approximately 94 of inventories for 2001 were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 290 million at february 1 2003 and by 340 million at february 2 2002 as described above in “significant items” we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the itemcost method for the former fred meyer divisions during 2002 

  

we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold 

  

merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation 

  

in addition to the product costs net of discounts and allowances advertising costs inbound freight charges warehousing costs including receiving and inspection costs and transportation costs are included in the “merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation” line item of the consolidated statements of earnings purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the “operating general and administrative” line item along with most of our other managerial and administrative costs 

  

warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred 

  

advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred 

  

whenever possible vendor rebates credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory in those instances the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs when the related merchandise is sold 

  

we believe the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout our industry our approach is to include the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in our stores in the merchandise cost line item we believe this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold and is consistent with recently issued accounting standards on the topic 

  

l iquidity and c apital r esources 

  

cash flow information 

  

cash from operations was 32 billion in 2002 compared to 23 billion in 2001 and 24 billion in 2000 the increase in 2002 over 2001 was due to an increase in earnings and a reduction of operating assets and liabilities increased earnings in 2001 were offset by increases in the use of cash for operating assets and liabilities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 19 billion in 2002 compared to 19 billion in 2001 and 16 billion in 2000 the amount of cash used by investing activities in 2002 was approximately equal to the amount used in 2001 due to consistent capital spending in 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures in 2002 included 192 million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease the increase in 2001 over 2000 was due to increased capital spending during 2002 2001 and 2000 our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled 1891 million 1913 million and 1623 million respectively we spent 126 million for acquisitions during 2002 compared to 103 million during 2001 and 67 million in 2000 we opened acquired expanded or relocated 151 food stores in 2002 146 food stores in 2001 and 150 food stores in 2000 during those same periods we remodeled 145 99 and 115 food stores respectively 

  

cash used by financing activities was 13 billion in 2002 compared to 433 million in 2001 and 878 million in 2000 the increase in the use of cash in 2002 versus 2001 was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in 2002 the decrease in the use of cash in 2001 versus 2000 primarily was due to increased borrowings in 2001 offset by increased treasury stock purchases 

  

ebitda 

  

our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants some of these covenants are based on ebitda which we historically defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization lifo extraordinary losses and onetime items in prior years we disclosed and discussed ebitda accordingly as we believed it was an important means by which to measure our liquidity or compliance with our debt covenants and also a measure by which management monitored our operating results furthermore that measure of ebitda is used in part to determine incentive compensation 

  

on january 22 2003 the sec issued release no 338176 that set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of nongaap financial measures as defined in the release the release provides an exemption with respect to disclosures of ebit and ebitda when discussing charges or liabilities that require or will require cash settlement provided that the amounts are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure however the definition of ebitda we have historically used includes an adjustment for nonrecurring infrequent or unusual items “onetime items” and our description of this nongaap measure of liquidity could be considered confusingly similar to descriptions used for gaap financial measures and permitted nongaap financial measures such as ebit or ebitda as a result the definition of ebitda we have historically used is prohibited by sec release no 338176 

  

we will continue to present ebitda as we continue to believe it is an important means by which to measure our liquidity however any future presentation of ebitda will be in accordance with sec release no 338176 we do not intend the presentation of ebitda to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance or liquidity the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda for the fiscal years of 2002 2001 and 2000 consistent with release no 338176 

  

   

refer to “significant items” for details of items that significantly affected kroger’s financial results during 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

debt management 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases decreased 256 million to 86 billion as of yearend 2002 from 88 billion as of yearend 2001 total debt increased 284 million as of yearend 2001 from 85 billion as of yearend 2000 the decrease in 2002 resulted from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt the increase in 2001 was due to increases in capital spending stock repurchase programs and operating assets and liabilities we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some of our structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense we also prefunded employee benefit costs of 300 million at yearend 2002 270 million at yearend 2001 and 208 million at yearend 2000 additionally the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt pursuant to sfas no 133 increased the carrying value of our debt by 110 million as of yearend 2002 and reduced the carrying value of our debt by 18 million as of yearend 2001 if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases which we classify as investments and the prefunding of employee benefits and also exclude the sfas no 133 marktomarket adjustments our net total debt would have been 81 billion as of yearend 2002 compared to 85 billion as of yearend 2001 and 83 billion as of yearend 2000 we believe net total debt is an important measure of our leverage due to the nature of the items described above therefore we believe net total debt should be reviewed in addition to total debt we do not intend the presentation of net total debt to be an alternative to total debt or to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of liquidity a reconciliation of net total debt is illustrated below 

  

   

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 500 million to 700 million under our unrated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities we have capacity available under our credit facilities to fund all cp amounts outstanding if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbbbaa3 the ability to borrow under the cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating this would require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities under which we believe we have sufficient capacity borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of 30 days 

  

although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating but also by a failure to maintain the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of february 1 2003 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of february 1 2003 in millions of dollars 

  

    

the construction commitments include capital to be expended for projects that were either under construction or for which a lease had been signed as of february 1 2003 our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities the obligations include purchases required under a product supply agreement with santee dairies inc “santee” in los angeles california we indirectly own a 50 interest in the entity that owns santee upon fred meyer’s acquisition of ralphsfood 4 less santee became a duplicate facility the product supply agreement which expires on july 29 2007 requires us to purchase 9 million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually the other partner has filed suit against kroger claiming among other things that the company is obligated to purchase all of the requirements of fluid milk for its ralphs and food 4 less divisions from santee as opposed to minimum gallons our unconditional purchase obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 

  

as of february 1 2003 we maintained three bank credit facilities consisting of an 8125 million fiveyear credit agreement a 700 million fiveyear credit agreement and a 125 billion 364day credit agreement the 8125 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 23 2006 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 700 million fiveyear facility terminates on may 22 2007 unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger the 364day facility terminates on may 22 2003 unless extended converted into a oneyear term loan or earlier terminated by kroger at february 1 2003 we also maintained a 75 million money market line in addition to credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreements at february 1 2003 those letters of credit totaled 258 million we had no borrowings under the money market line at february 1 2003 the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings have been classified as longterm borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts accordingly the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 

  

at february 1 2003 the amount of outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings was unusually low relative to the amount of outstanding senior notes due primarily to the issuance of 500 million senior notes in late january of 2003 the proceeds of this issuance were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreements prior to the purchase on february 28 2003 of the assets that were financed under a synthetic lease at february 1 2003 and the repayment of 250 million senior notes on march 3 2003 the asset purchase and note repayments were funded primarily by credit agreement borrowings the synthetic lease is more fully described below refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 1 2003 we had available for issuance 15 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june 27 2002 as amended in a filing made on july 18 2002 and declared effective on july 23 2002 

  

we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 8 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february 1 2003 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also guaranteed approximately 5 million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012 

  

at february 1 2003 we were a party to a financing transaction related to 16 properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately 202 million under the terms of the financing transaction which was structured as a synthetic lease a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of kroger the lease had a term of five years which expired on february 28 2003 the owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment the transaction therefore was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense kroger purchased the assets for total costs of 202 million when the lease expired 

  

we are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to assume leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 

  

i mpact of i nflation 

  

while management believes that kroger’s sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold yeartoyear and other pricing and competitive influences in 2002 we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost deflation of 03 excluding supermarket fuel centers we estimate our product cost deflation was also 03 we recorded a pretax lifo credit of 50 million in 2002 this amount was larger than expected and included a 28 million pretax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of eitf 0216 product cost deflation in our jewelry divisions and in the general merchandise departments in our fred meyer stores accounted for most of the remaining 22 million pretax credit 

  

we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of 01 in 2001 we experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to management’s success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers costs of other commodities such as pharmacy and general merchandise increased in 2001 

  

r ecently i ssued a ccounting s tandards 

  

eitf issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” became effective for kroger on january 1 2003 this issue addresses the appropriate accounting for consideration received from a vendor due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory historically we recognized those allowances as they were earned based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract this accounting treatment was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles for all contracts entered or modified after january 1 2003 we have recognized prospectively and will continue to recognize vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold in accordance with issue no 0216 net earnings were not affected by the adoption of issue no 0216 adoption of issue no 0216 resulted in a 28 million pretax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002 this expense was offset by a corresponding 28 million pretax lifo credit that was also included in merchandise costs in 2002 

  

sfas no 141 “business combinations” was issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” in june of 2001 this standard requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the statement also addresses the recognition of intangible assets in a business combination adoption of sfas no 141 did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” was issued by the fasb in june of 2001 the statement addresses the accounting for intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination the statement also addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition sfas no 142 provides that goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 

  

kroger adopted sfas no 142 on february 3 2002 accordingly we performed a transitional impairment review of our goodwill goodwill totaled 3594 million as of february 3 2002 the review was performed at the operating division level generally fair value represented a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows impairment was indicated when the carrying value of a division including goodwill exceeded its fair value we determined that the carrying value of the jewelry store division which included 26 million of goodwill exceeded its fair value impairment was not indicated for the goodwill associated with the other operating divisions 

  

the fair value of the jewelry store division was subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill as a result of this analysis we determined that the jewelry store division goodwill was entirely impaired impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis rather than on an undiscounted basis as was the standard under sfas no 121 prior to adoption of sfas no 142 accordingly we recorded a 16 million charge net of a 10 million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of 2002 kroger’s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2002 no impairment was indicated as a result of the fourth quarter 2002 review 

  

sfas no 143 “asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 this standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs sfas no 143 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 this standard replaces sfas no 121 and apb no 30 and amends apb no 51 sfas no 144 became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” was issued by the fasb in april of 2002 sfas no 145 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 this statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and if material classified as an extraordinary item net of the related income tax effect adoption of sfas no 145 in the first quarter of 2003 will require kroger to reclassify the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 and 2000 as interest expense in the respective years 

  

sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” was issued by the fasb in june of 2002 sfas no 146 addresses significant issues relating to the recognition measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 all closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 have been and will continue to be accounted for accordingly adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 123” was issued by the fasb in december of 2002 sfas no 148 addresses the transition methods that can be followed by companies that elect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123 sfas no 148 also mandates certain annual and interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 123 the provisions of sfas no 148 became effective for kroger in fiscal 2002 the additional disclosures required by sfas no 148 are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

fasb interpretation no 45 “fin 45” “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” was issued by the fasb in november of 2002 fin 45 addresses a guarantor’s accounting for and disclosure of the issuance of some guarantees the provisions of fin 45 relating to initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 these provisions did not have a material effect on our financial statements in fiscal 2002 the disclosure requirements of fin 45 became effective for kroger in fiscal 2002 and are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the disclosures also are summarized above in “factors affecting liquidity” any future guarantees issued by kroger will be accounted for in compliance with this interpretation 

  

fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” was issued by the fasb in january of 2003 fin 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for variableinterest entities as defined in the interpretation fin 46 is effective for all variableinterest entities created after january 31 2003 for any variableinterest entities created prior to february 1 2003 fin 46 will become effective for kroger on august 17 2003 we are analyzing our structured financing arrangements joint ventures and partnerships to determine the effect this interpretation will have on our financial statements if we are required to consolidate any entity we anticipate that such consolidation will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

o utlook 

  

this analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected growth in earnings per share “eps” working capital reduction our ability to generate operating cash flow and our strategic growth plan “plan” and are indicated by words or phrases such as “comfortable” “committed” “expects” “goal” “target” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21 e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

at the end of 2002 working capital decreased 69 million compared to the end of 2001 and decreased 72 million compared to end of 2000 at the end of 2002 comparative net operating working capital decreased 193 million compared to the end of 2001 and decreased 50 million compared to the end of 2000 we expect to reduce net operating working capital by 100 million in 2003 a reconciliation of net operating working capital as of yearend 2002 2001 and 2000 is shown below 

  

    

   

   

   

   

various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot fully foresee the effects of the general economic downturn on kroger’s business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for 2003 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 23 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

as of february 1 2003 we maintained seven interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 1673 million to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates one of these agreements matured in 2003 and the remaining six agreements the “old agreements” matured from 2006 through 2012 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we reconfigured a portion of our interest derivative portfolio by terminating the old agreements and initiating six new agreements the “new agreements” with notional amounts totaling 1500 million maturing from 2005 through 2008 we received proceeds totaling 138 million as a result of the termination of the old agreements the new agreements also effectively converted a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar libor the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

as of february 1 2003 we also maintained three interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately 723 million to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates these agreements which mature in 2003 and 2004 involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar libor the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense these agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines in addition our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february 1 2003 the amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february 1 2003 interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1 2003 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february 1 2003 refer to notes 9 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

   

   

the table below provides an illustration of our interest rate derivatives portfolio had the changes made to our portfolio in the first quarter of 2003 been effective as of february 1 2003 the variable component of each interest rate derivative is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1 2003 

  

   

the interest rate collar is reset based on the three month libor with the following impact 

  

   

   

   

   

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

as noted above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—significant items” we recorded a pretax loss of 81 million in the third quarter of 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we continue to mark the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis these liabilities had remaining balances of 45 million as of february 1 2003 if the estimates we used as of february 1 2003 for future market prices for electricity were 001kwh higher or lower 001kwh represented approximately 23 of the future prices of electricity assumed as of february 1 2003 these liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately 12 million respectively as of february 1 2003

total sales for the 52 weeks of 2001 were 501 billion compared to 490 billion for the 53 weeks of 2000 and 454 billion for the 52 weeks of 1999 these sales amounts represent annual increases of 22 in 2001 and 80 in 2000 excluding sales from divested stores and adjusting for the estimated effect of a 53rd week of sales in 2000 annual increases would have been 42 in 2001 and 60 in 2000 the weak economy and competitive pressures affected total sales in 2001 while the 2000 increase resulted from strong store operations identical food store sales stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters increased 09 in 2001 and 15 in 2000 comparable food store sales which include expansions and relocations increased 15 in 2001 and 19 in 2000 excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers identical food store sales increased 04 and comparable food store sales increased 09 in 2001 

  

gross profit 

  

coordinated purchasing category management technology related efficiencies and increases in corporate brand sales have enabled us to increase our gross profit to 2735 of sales in 2001 from 2693 in 2000 and 2654 in 1999 excluding onetime expenses described in “mergerrelated costs and onetime expenses” below and the effect of lifo gross profit as a percent of sales increased to 2742 in 2001 from 2699 in 2000 and 2660 in 1999 

  

operating general and administrative expenses 

  

operating general and administrate expenses as a percent of sales were 1893 in 2001 1868 in 2000 and 1836 in 1999 excluding onetime expenses described in “mergerrelated costs and onetime expenses” below operating general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 1865 in 2001 1846 in 2000 and 1830 in 1999 these costs as a percent of sales increased due to higher health care and energy costs in 2001 and 2000 credit card fees as a percent of sales also increased in 2001 these increased costs offset significant productivity gains at the store level 

  

ebitda 

  

our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization lifo charge extraordinary loss and onetime items “ebitda” the ability to generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strength we do not intend the presentation of ebitda to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance presentation of ebitda is based on the definition contained in our bank credit facilities this may be a different definition than other companies use we were in compliance with all ebitdabased bank credit facility and indenture covenants on february 2 2002 

  

ebitda for 2001 increased 58 to 3742 million from 3536 million in 2000 ebitda for 2000 increased 132 from 3124 million in 1999 without adjusting for the extra week in 2000 these ebitda increases were primarily due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales efficiencies described in “gross profit” above returns from capital investments and returns from recent acquisitions 

  

the following is a summary of the calculation of ebitda for the 2001 2000 and 1999 fiscal years 

  

 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate decreased to 391 in 2001 from 416 in 2000 and 435 in 1999 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 was due to the writeoff of nondeductible goodwill in 2000 and a lower effective state income tax rate in 2001 the decrease from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to the absence of nondeductible transaction costs in 2000 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings and the effects of mergerrelated costs onetime expenses and extraordinary losses for the three years ended february 2 2002 were 

  

 

  

m erger r elated c osts and o ne  time e xpenses 

  

we are continuing to implement our integration plan relating to recent mergers the integration plan includes distribution consolidation systems integration store conversions store closures and administration integration total pretax mergerrelated costs were 4 million in 2001 15 million in 2000 and 383 million in 1999 

  

in addition to mergerrelated costs that are shown separately on the consolidated statement of income we incurred other pretax onetime expenses that are included in merchandise costs and operating general and administrative expenses onetime expenses in 2001 included 81 million of losses on energy purchase contracts and 20 million of lease liabilities related to store closings expenses in 2000 also included 67 million of lease liabilities for store closings remaining onetime expenses incurred during 2001 and 2000 and the 1999 expenses were costs related to recent mergers 

  

during 2001 and 2000 we recorded pretax impairment charges of 91 million and 191 million respectively in 2000 we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for 2000 and beyond in 2001 we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for 2002 and beyond in both years we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used in 2000 we also identified impairment losses for certain investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased the 2001 charge relates to locations that either had not opened or had only recently opened when the 2000 impairment review was performed as a result estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time 

  

kroger also recorded a pretax 37 million restructuring charge in 2001 primarily for severance agreements associated with its strategic growth plan announced in december 2001 

  

the table below details all of our mergerrelated costs and onetime items 

  

 

  

please refer to footnotes 3 4 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these items 

  

c ritical a ccounting p olicies 

  

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner the significant accounting policies are summarized in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

workers’ compensation costs 

  

we primarily are selfinsured for costs related to workers’ compensation claims liabilities are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported these liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis we have purchased stoploss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 

  

the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in such claims can impact amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how such claims ultimately are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables such changes could have a considerable impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 

  

asset impairments 

  

we monitor the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred such as current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if impairment is identified for longlived assets other than real property we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current carrying value and record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows with respect to owned property and equipment associated with closed stores the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of carrying value over estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the income statement as “asset impairment charges” 

  

goodwill 

  

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 adoption of this standard will change our method of accounting for goodwill which totaled 3594 million as of february 2 2002 goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis goodwill amortization expense totaled 103 million in 2001 nonamortization of goodwill will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately 96 million 

  

we will review goodwill for impairment at the operating division level generally fair value will represent a multiple of ebitda as defined above in “results of operations” or discounted projected future cash flows and will be compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division will be measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s goodwill goodwill impairment will be recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value 

  

the annual impairment review required by sfas no 142 requires extensive uses of accounting judgment and financial estimates application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level could produce significantly different results 

  

we currently are performing our initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

  

store closing costs 

  

we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining rent payments on closed stores the closed store liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 25 years as of february 2 2002 closed store lease liabilities totaled 234 million for stores we intend to sell we actively market the stores to potential buyers stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect recoverable values although we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the store expected to be closed is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by specific real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions 

  

store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined other costs related to closed store locations are reflected in the income statement as “operating general and administrative” costs reductions in the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store are reflected in the income statement as “asset impairment charges” in accordance with our policy on asset impairments inventory writedowns if any in connection with store closings are classified in “merchandise costs” costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period 

  

purchase commitments 

  

from time to time we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices upon entering into these commitments and on a quarterly basis thereafter we evaluate the company’s expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

benefit plans 

  

the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts those assumptions are described in footnote 18 to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions materially may affect our pension and 

other postretirement obligations and our future expense footnote 18 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other postretirement benefit costs and the related liability 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lastin firstout “lifo” basis or market in total approximately 94 of inventories for 2001 and 2000 were valued using the lifo method approximately 61 of inventories in 2001 were valued using the lifo itemcost method and approximately 33 were valued using the lifo retail method we will evaluate the benefits of converting the remaining divisions to the itemcost method in the near future cost for the balance of the inventories is determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by 340 million at february 2 2002 and 319 million at february 3 2001 we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold 

  

merchandise costs 

  

vendor rebates credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities including lumpsum payments associated with longterm contracts are recorded as a component of merchandise costs as they are earned in accordance with the underlying agreement

cash flow information 

  

cash from operations was 2347 million in 2001 compared to 2359 million in 2000 and 1462 million in 1999 increased earnings in 2001 were offset by increases in the use of cash for working capital the increase in 2000 was due to an increase in earnings and our efforts to reduce net operating working capital and improve cash flow 

  

cash used by investing activities was 1965 million in 2001 compared to 1601 million in 2000 and 1724 million in 1999 the increase in 2001 was due to increased capital spending the decrease in 2000 was primarily related to our storing activity and asset acquisitions during 2001 2000 and 1999 we had capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of 2139 million 1623 million and 1691 million respectively we spent 103 million for acquisitions during 2001 compared to 67 million in 2000 and 230 million in 1999 we opened acquired expanded or relocated 146 food stores in 2001 150 food stores in 2000 and 197 food stores in 1999 during those same periods we remodeled 99 115 and 142 food stores respectively 

  

cash used by financing activities was 382 million in 2001 compared to 878 million in 2000 financing activities provided cash of 280 million in 1999 the decrease in the use of cash in 2001 primarily was due to increased borrowings in 2001 offset by increased treasury stock purchases the decrease in cash during 2000 was due to a decrease in the amount borrowed and an increase in the treasury shares purchased during 2000 

  

debt management 

  

we have several lines of credit totaling approximately 35 billion borrowings of approximately 14 billion at february 2 2002 primarily commercial paper borrowings reduce the funds available under our lines of credit in addition we are a party to a 393 million synthetic lease credit facility at february 2 2002 as further described below in “factors affecting liquidity” 

  

total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital leases increased 302 million to 88 billion in 2001 and decreased 468 million to 85 billion in 2000 the increase in 2001 was due to an increase in capital spending stock repurchase programs and working capital the decrease in 2000 was due to the use of free cash flow to pay down outstanding debt balances we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense we also prefunded employee benefit costs of 270 million at yearend 2001 208 million at yearend 2000 and 200 million at yearend 1999 if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases which we classify as investments and the prefunding of employee benefits our net total debt would have been 85 billion at yearend 2001 compared to 83 billion at yearend 2000 and 87 billion at yearend 1999 

  

in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february 2 2002 we had available for issuance 125 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on november 13 2001 

  

subsequent events 

  

on march 26 2002 we issued 500 million 675 senior notes due in 2012 we also entered into two pay variable interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 500 million expiring in 2012 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

  

we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately 700 to 900 million under our unrated commercial paper “cp” program these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities if our credit rating was to decline below its current level of bbbbaa3 the ability to borrow under the cp program could be adversely affected causing us to have to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program depending on the current interest rate environment however because our cp program is unrated we do not anticipate significant difficulties in continuing our cp program in the event of a downgrade of our rated debt 

  

although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating but also a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense as defined in the credit facilities if our credit rating would be downgraded one level or if our applicable percentage ratio were to decrease from 598 to 1 at february 2 2002 to below 400 to 1 the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 025 

  

if our yearend 2001 net debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of 234 to 1 were to be higher than 350 to 1 or our 2001 fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus rent expense to consolidated interest expense plus rent expense of 342 to 1 would fall below 170 to 1 we would be in default of our credit facilities 

  

the tables below illustrate our significant contractual and other commercial commitments as of yearend 2001 in millions of dollars 

  

 

  

  

our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities these purchase obligations also include management fees for certain facilities operated by third parties 

  

we maintain three bank credit facilities the obligations under the 1875 million senior credit facility are guaranteed by kroger and our “material subsidiaries” as defined in the facility the revolving portion of the senior credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the support of fred meyer’s commercial paper program this agreement expires in february 2003 we also maintain an 8125 million facility that expires in may 2006 and an 8125 million 364day facility that expires in may 2002 we currently are involved in negotiations to refinance the current 364day facility and the 1875 million senior credit facility with new 364day and fiveyear facilities in an aggregate amount not expected to exceed 22 billion unrated commercial paper borrowings of 799 million and borrowings under money market lines of 100 million at february 2 2002 have been classified as longterm because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities additionally we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis and have presented the amounts as outstanding under the credit facilities approximately 44 million of the standby letters of credit are backed by our credit facilities reducing the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities refer to footnote 9 of the financial statements for further details of our debt obligations 

  

we also maintain in excess of 400 million of surety bonds related primarily to our selfinsured insurance costs these bonds are required by most states in which we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures and are made with thirdparty insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs however we do pay annual maintenance fees to 

have these bonds in place market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe such increased costs or decreased availability significantly would impact our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 

  

most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and certain of its subsidiaries see footnote 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50 ownership our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately 8 million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february 2 2002 it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 

  

we also are a party to a financing transaction related to 34 properties which were constructed for total costs of approximately 393 million under the terms of the financing transaction which was structured as a synthetic lease a special purpose trust owns the properties and leases them to subsidiaries of kroger the lease has a term of five years which expires in february 2003 we pay a variable lease rate of approximately 33 at february 2 2002 

  

the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease and the owner of the special purpose trust has made a substantive residual equity investment the transaction therefore is accounted for offbalance sheet and the related costs are reported as rent expense as of february 2 2002 the assets and liabilities of the special purpose trust primarily were comprised of the properties and 379 million of bank debt used to fund the construction of the properties 

  

in connection with these financing transactions we have made a residual value guarantee for the leased property equal to 85 of the financing or 335 million we believe the market values of the property subject to this financing exceeded the residual value guarantee at yearend 2001 we intend to reduce the synthetic lease facility by approximately 200 million in the first quarter 2002 

  

commodity price protection 

  

we enter into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices we enter into such commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales for any commitments in which we do not expect to take delivery and as a result will require net settlement the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 

  

as more fully described below in “recently issued accounting standards” we recorded a pretax loss of 81 million in the third quarter 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception as of february 2 2002 these liabilities totaled 78 million 

  

i mpact of i nflation 

  

while management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is due to inflation it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold yeartoyear and other pricing and competitive influences we believe there was overall inflation in retail prices we experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to management’s success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers in other commodities such as pharmacy and general merchandise our costs of product increased by attempting to control costs and efficiently utilize resources we strive to minimize the effects of inflation on operations 

  

o ther i ssues 

  

on january 6 1999 we changed our fiscal yearend to the saturday nearest january 31 of each year this change is disclosed in our current report on form 8k dated january 6 1999 we filed separate audited financial 

statements covering the transition period from january 3 1999 to january 30 1999 on a current report on form 8k dated may 10 1999 these financial statements included kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with fred meyer during the transition period we had sales of 2160 million costs and expenses of 2135 million and net earnings of 25 million 

  

we indirectly own a 50 interest in the entity that owns the santee dairy in los angeles california and have a product supply agreement with santee that requires us to purchase 9 million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually the product supply agreement expires on july 29 2007 upon acquisition of ralphsfood 4 less santee became excess capacity and a duplicate facility the joint venture is managed independently and has a board comprised of an equal number of members from each partner plus one independent member when there is a split vote this member generally votes with the other partner

statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 137 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities—deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 133” and sfas no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities” became effective for kroger as of february 4 2001 sfas no 133 as amended defines derivatives requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met initial adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in kroger recording a liability of 9 million with a corresponding charge recorded as other comprehensive loss net of income tax effects 

  

in accordance with sfas no 133 derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as “cash flow” hedges to the extent the hedges are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income net of related tax effects the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge if any is recognized in currentperiod earnings other comprehensive income is reclassified to currentperiod earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges along with the corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities are recorded in currentperiod earnings 

  

we assess both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 

  

as of february 2 2002 we maintain four interest rate swaps and one interest rate collar designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt a liability totaling 11 million has been recorded for these instruments we also have recorded a liability of 42 million related to a cash flow hedge of electricity purchases as more fully described below hedge ineffectiveness was not material for these instruments during 2001 corresponding charges were recorded as other comprehensive loss net of income tax effects in addition we maintain five interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt as of february 2 2002 a liability totaling 18 million has been recorded to reflect the fair value of these swaps offset by an asset for the same amount to reflect the impact of the change in interest rates on the fair value of the debt 

  

during march through may 2001 kroger entered into four separate commitments to purchase electricity from one of our utility suppliers in southern california at the inception of these contracts forecasted electricity usage which was estimated primarily based on historical energy usage indicated that it was probable that all of the electricity would be utilized in our operations we therefore accounted for the contracts in accordance with the 

normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 133 as amended and no amounts were recorded in the financial statements related to these purchase commitments 

  

during the third quarter 2001 we reassessed our projected electricity requirements in southern california due primarily to energy conservation programs initiated by kroger in the latter half of 2001 we determined that we no longer needed all of the electricity that we had committed to purchase as a result one of the contracts and a portion of a second contract were deemed to exceed expected electricity usage thereby eliminating the normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 133 for those contracts and requiring the fair value of the contracts to be recorded currently in earnings these contracts will continue to be markedtomarket through current earnings each quarter accordingly we recorded a pretax third quarter charge of 81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of these contracts through december 2006 these liabilities totaled 78 million as of february 2 2002 the remaining portion of the second contract has been redesignated as a cash flow hedge of future purchases the other two purchase commitments continue to qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 133 

  

a tabular summary of our interest rate swaps and energy purchase commitments that are included in the financial statements is included in footnote 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” were issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” in late june of 2001 sfas no 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 and sfas no 142 became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis we estimate that nonamortization of goodwill will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately 96 million 

  

kroger currently is performing its initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 143 “asset retirement obligations” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 sfas no 143 became effective for kroger on february 2 2003 we currently are analyzing the effect this standard will have on our financial statements 

  

sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” was issued by the fasb in august of 2001 sfas no 144 became effective for kroger on february 3 2002 we expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

emerging issues task force eitf issue nos 0022 “accounting for “points” and certain other timebased or volumebased sales and incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future” and 0109 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” became effective for kroger beginning in the first quarter of 2002 these issues address the appropriate accounting for certain vendor contracts and loyalty programs we continue to assess the effect these new standards will have on the financial statements we expect the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements

this analysis contains certain forwardlooking statements about kroger’s future performance these statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected growth in earnings per share “eps” working capital reduction a decline in our net total debttoebitda ratio our ability to generate free cash flow and our strategic growth plan and are indicated by words or phrases such as “comfortable” “committed” “expects” “goal” and similar words or phrases these forwardlooking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially our ability to achieve annual eps growth goals will be affected primarily by pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional food retailers our responses to these actions intended to increase market share and the success of our strategic growth plan announced in december 2001 in addition kroger’s eps growth goals could be affected by increases in product costs newly opened or consolidated distribution centers our ability to obtain sales growth from new square footage competitive activity in the markets in which we operate changes in our product mix and changes in laws and regulations our ability to reduce our net total debttoebitda ratio could be adversely affected by our ability to generate sales growth and free cash flow interest rate fluctuations and other changes in capital market conditions kroger’s stock repurchase activity unexpected increases in the cost of capital expenditures acquisitions and other factors the results of our strategic growth plan and our ability to generate free cash flow to the extent expected could be adversely affected if any of the factors identified above negatively impact our operations in addition the timing of the execution of the plan could adversely impact our eps and sales results 

  

statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within 

the meaning of section 21 e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements our forwardlooking statements are based on the following assumptions among others and if these assumptions prove to be incorrect our actual results may be adversely affected 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

as part of the plan we have established a longterm sustainable annual earningspershare “eps” growth target of 1315 before onetime items beginning in fiscal 2004 for fiscal 2002 and 2003 we expect annual eps growth of 1012 before onetime items we also estimate that adoption of sfas no 142 will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately 96 million beyond the expected growth rate of 1012 

  

kroger estimates free cash flow to be approximately 550650 million in fiscal 2002 the estimate reflects capital spending of 21 billion which is consistent with prior plans and a net working capital reduction of 100 million 

  

we believe the total cost of the strategic growth plan will be approximately 75 million to 90 million pretax a reduction of 10 million from our original estimate in december 2001 in the fourth quarter 2001 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with this plan most of this severance will be paid in 2002 

  

 

  

 

  

we have identified the following uncertainties about the future that could have an adverse effect on our actual results 

  

 

  

 

of sales thus reducing margins while we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our share of sales and net income 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made by us or our representatives 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

  

we limit our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates to do this we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of 23 billion or less iii include no leveraged products and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current marktomarket status 

  

during the third quarter 2001 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates maturity dates of interest rate swap arrangements match those of the underlying debt these agreements which mature from 2003 to 2008 involve the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts variable rates for our agreements are based on threemonth us dollar libor and are reset on a quarterly basis the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense the notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately 12 billion at february 2 2002 these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

  

also during the third quarter of 2001 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates these agreements which mature in 2003 and 2004 involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts variable rates for our agreements are based on threemonth us dollar libor and are reset on a quarterly basis the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense the notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately 923 million at february 2 2002 these agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

  

annually we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines in addition our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 

  

the table below provides information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio the amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2 2002 the fairvalue column includes the fairvalue of those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives as of february 2 2002 refer to footnotes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements

common stock in october 1997 under these plans we made open market purchases
totaling 122 million in 1998 on october 18 1998 we rescinded the repurchase
program as a result of execution of the merger agreement between kroger and fred

solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax
benefit in january 2000 the board of directors authorized an additional

calendar in 1999 the calendar change the 1998 results include the results
of ralphsfood 4 less from march 10 1998 as a result of the calendar change

adjusting for the change in krogers fiscal calendar excluding sales from
divested stores and adjusting for a 53rd week of sales in 2000 and 1998 annual
increases would have been 60 in 2000 and 61 in 1999 these increases were
the results of strong store operations that helped increase identical food store
sales stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters
by 15 in 2000 and 23 in 1999 comparable store sales which include
expansions and relocations increased 19 in 2000 and 30 in 1999

  gross profit

      coordinated purchasing category management technology related
efficiencies and increases in corporate brand sales have enabled us to increase
our gross profit to 2691 of sales in 2000 from 2648 in 1999 and 2560 in
1998 adjusting for the calendar change and excluding onetime expenses an
accounting change made in 1998

see note five of the financial statements and the effect of lifo gross
profit as a percent of sales increased to 2699 in 2000 from 2660 in 1999
and 2612 in 1998

  operating general and administrative expenses

      operating general and administrate expenses as a percent of sales were
1865 in 2000 1843 in 1999 and 1802 in 1998 excluding onetime expenses
and adjusting the 1998 amounts to reflect the calendar change operating
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 1843 in 2000
1830 in 1999 and 1815 in 1998 these costs increased due to higher health
care and energy costs in 2000 the 1999 increase was due to a higher incentive
payout based on performance

  ebitda

      our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly
issued debt contain various restrictive covenants many of these covenants are
based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization lifo
charge extraordinary loss and onetime items ebitda the ability to
generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these
agreements is a key measure of our financial strength we do not intend to
present ebitda as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle
measure of performance rather presentation of ebitda is based on the
definition contained in our bank credit facility this may be a different
definition than other companies use we were in compliance with all ebitdabased
bank credit facility and indenture covenants on february 3 2001

      ebitda for 2000 increased 132 to 3536 million from 3124 million in
1999 ebitda for 1999 increased 116 from 2800 million in 1998 these ebitda
increases were primarily due to economies of scale resulting from increased
sales efficiencies described in gross profit above returns from capital
investments and returns from recent acquisitions

      the following is a summary of the calculation of ebitda for the 2000
1999 and 1998 fiscal years

  income taxes

      our effective tax rate decreased to 416 in 2000 from 435 in 1999 and
433 in 1998 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 1999 to 2000 was due
primarily to the absence of nondeductible transaction costs in

merger related costs and onetime expenses

      we are continuing to implement our integration plan relating to recent
mergers the integration plan includes distribution consolidation systems
integration store conversions store closures and administration integration
total merger related costs were 15 million in 2000 383 million in 1999 and
269 million in 1998

      in addition to merger related costs that are shown separately on the
statement of income we also incurred other onetime expenses that are included
in merchandise costs and operating general and administrative expenses the
onetime expenses incurred during 2000 and 1999 were costs related to recent
mergers the 1998 onetime expenses were costs incurred associated with
logistics projects and operations consolidation in texas

      during 2000 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 191
million we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and
updated profitability forecasts for 2000 and beyond this impairment review
occurred during the first quarter of 2000 during this review we identified
impairment losses for assets to be disposed of assets to be held and used and
certain investments in former suppliers that have

liquidity and capital resources

  cash flows information

      cash flow from operations was 2281 million in 2000 compared to 1548
million in 1999 and 1838 million in 1998 the increase in 2000 was due to an
increase in earnings and our efforts to reduce net operating working capital and
improve cash flow the decrease in cash provided by operations during 1999 was
due to an increase in inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 1999 as a
result of the effect of y2k

      cash flows used by investing activities was 1523 million in 2000
compared to 1810 million in 1999 and 1465 million in 1998 the decrease in
2000 and increase in 1999 were primarily related to our storing activity and
asset acquisitions during 2000 1999 and 1998 we had capital expenditures
excluding acquisitions of 1623 million 1691 million and 1646 million
respectively we spent 67 million for acquisitions during 2000 compared to 230
million in 1999 and 86 million in 1998 we opened acquired expanded or
relocated 150 food stores in 2000 197 food stores in 1999 and 142 food stores
in 1998 during those same periods we remodeled 115 142 and 165 food stores
respectively

      cash used by financing activities was 878 million in 2000 compared to
cash provided of 280 million in 1999 and a use of 257 million in 1998 the
decrease in cash during 2000 was due to a decrease in the amount borrowed and an
increase in the treasury shares purchased during 2000 the increase in cash in
1999 was due to fewer debt prepayment costs in 1999 compared to 1998 and a
decrease in the financing charges incurred during 1999 the debt prepayment
costs in 1998 related primarily to debt refinancing as a result of mergers at
fred meyer inc

  debt management

      we have several lines of credit totaling approximately 38 billion with
14 billion of unused balances at february 3 2001 in addition we have a 470
million synthetic lease credit facility with no unused balance and 175 million
in money market lines with an unused balance of 75 million at february 3 2001

                                     10
page   12

      total debt including both the current and longterm portions of capital
leases decreased 468 million to 85 billion in 2000 and increased 441
million to 90 billion in 1999 both the decrease in 2000 and the increase in
1999 were due to business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting in 1999 we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders
of some structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest
expense we also prefunded employee benefit costs of 208 million at yearend
2000 and 200 million at yearend 1999 and 1998 if we exclude the debt
incurred to make these purchases which we classify as investments and the
prefunding of employee benefits our net total debt would have been 83 billion
at yearend 2000 compared to 87 billion at yearend 1999 and 83 billion at
yearend 1998

      in addition to the available credit mentioned above we currently have
available for issuance 925 million of securities under a shelf registration
statement filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared
effective on february 2 2000

impact of inflation

      while management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is
due to inflation it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of
inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold yeartoyear and
other pricing and competitive influences although we believe there was
inflation in retail prices we experienced deflation in our costs of product due
to synergies and the economies of scale created by recent mergers by attempting
to control costs and efficiently utilize resources we strive to minimize the
effects of inflation on operations

other issues

      on january 6 1999 we changed our fiscal yearend to the saturday nearest
january 31 of each year this change is disclosed in our current report on form
8k dated january 6 1999 we filed separate audited financial statements
covering the transition period from january 3 1999 to january 30 1999 on a
current report on form 8k dated may 10 1999 these financial statements
included kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before

the merger with fred meyer during the transition period we had sales of 2160
million costs and expenses of 2135 million and net earnings of 25 million

      we indirectly own a 50 interest in the entity that owns the santee dairy
in los angeles california and have a product supply agreement with santee that
requires us to purchase 9 million gallons of fluid milk and other products
annually the product supply agreement expires on july 29 2007 upon
acquisition of ralphsfood 4 less santee became excess capacity and a duplicate

recently issued accounting standards

      statement of financial accounting standards sfas 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas 137
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the
effective date of fasb statement no 133 and sfas 138 accounting for certain
derivative instruments and certain hedging activities is effective for the
kroger co as of february 4 2001 sfas 133 requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value the
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of
the derivative we have determined that the adoption of these new accounting
standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements

      in march 2000 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb
interpretation fin 44 accounting for certain transactions involving stock
compensation which clarifies the application of accounting principals board

except for the provisions that relate to modifications that directly or
indirectly reduce the exercise price of an award and the definition of an
employee which became effective after december 15 1998 the adoption of fin 44
did not have a material effect on our financial statements

outlook

      statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations
hopes beliefs intentions or strategies are forwardlooking statements within
the meaning of section 21 e of the securities exchange act of 1934 while we
believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties and other factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from those statements in particular

       we expect to reduce net operating working capital compared to the third
        quarter of 1999 by 500 million by the end of the third quarter 2004 we
        define net operating working capital as current operating assets less
        current operating liabilities we do not intend to present net operating
        working capital as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting
        principle measure of performance rather we believe this presentation is
        relevant to an assessment of our financial performance as of the end of
        fiscal 2000 we have reduced net operating working capital 183 million
        when compared to the fourth quarter of

       we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as
        from increased productivity from existing locations during the next two
        years kroger plans to grow square footage by 40  50 year over
        year we expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by
        including numerous specialty departments such as pharmacies natural
        foods seafood shops floral shops and bakeries we believe the
        combination store format will allow us to withstand continued
        competition from other food retailers supercenters mass merchandisers
        club or warehouse stores drug stores and restaurants


       our targeted annual earnings per share growth is 16  18 through the
        fiscal year ending february 1 2003 and 15 thereafter

       capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion
        and acquisition as well as our emphasis on selfdevelopment and
        ownership of store real estate and on logistics and technology
        improvements the continued capital spending in technology focusing on
        improved store operations logistics manufacturing procurement
        category management merchandising and buying practices should reduce
        merchandising costs as a percent of sales we expect our capital
        expenditures for fiscal 2001 to total 20 billion excluding
        acquisitions we intend to use the combination of free cash flows from
        operations including reductions in working capital and borrowings
        under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements if
        determined preferable we may fund capital expenditure requirements by
        mortgaging facilities entering into saleleaseback transactions or by
        issuing additional debt or equity

       based on current operating results we believe that operating cash flow
        and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our
        commercial paper program and bank credit facilities will be adequate to
        meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures
        interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable
        future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants
        to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions

       a decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital
        expansion plans share repurchase programs and general operating
        activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us
        to miss our earnings targets because we obtain some of our sales growth
        from new square footage

       the grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce
        competition from other grocery retailers supercenters club or
        warehouse stores and drug stores our ability to maintain our current
        success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and
        continue to reduce operating expenses the competitive environment may
        cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of
        sales

                                     14

        thus reducing margins while we believe our opportunities for sustained
        profitable growth are considerable unanticipated actions of competitors
        could impact our share of sales and net income

       changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting
        standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a
        material impact on our financial statements

       changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating
        regions including the rate of inflation population growth and
        employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect
        our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores
        this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth general economic
        changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers which
        could affect sales and earnings

       changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial
        indicators for example we have added and will continue to add
        supermarket fuel centers since gasoline is a low profit margin item
        with high sales dollars we expect to see our gross profit margins
        decrease as we sell more gasoline although this negatively affects our
        gross profit margin gasoline provides a positive effect on ebitda and
        net earnings

       we are party to more than 335 collective bargaining agreements with
        local unions representing approximately 204120 employees during 2000
        we negotiated 45 labor contracts without any material work stoppages
        typical agreements are three to five years in duration and as
        agreements expire we expect to enter new collective bargaining
        agreements in 2001 96 collective bargaining agreements will expire we
        cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage
        a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could
        have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations

       our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and
        achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our
        operations

       we retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and
        general liability claims it is possible that these claims may cause
        significant expenditures that would affect the operating cash flows of
        the company

       our capital expenditures could fall outside of the expected range if we
        are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if
        development costs exceed those budgeted or if our logistics and
        technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on
        budget

       adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge
        for our products or may decrease the customer demand for certain
        products additionally increases in the costs of inputs such as
        utility costs or raw material costs could negatively impact financial
        ratios and net earnings

       although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in
        foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the
        prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass these
        increases on to our customers our gross margin and ebitda will suffer

       interest rate fluctuation and other capital market conditions may cause
        variability in earnings although we use derivative financial
        instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks we are still
        exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market
        conditions

other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual
results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking
information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from
those included in or contemplated or implied by forwardlooking statements made
by us or our representatives

item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

      we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure
to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and to a lesser extent adverse
fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks we do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as a matter of policy
all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying
economic exposure because of the high correlation between the hedging
instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuation in the value of the
instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the
underlying exposure the derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with
liquid markets

      we limit our exposure to rising interest rates through the strategic use
of variable and fixed rate debt interest rate swaps interest rate caps and
interest rate collars during 1999 as a result of the merger with fred meyer
the nature and magnitude of our debt portfolio changed significantly including
a permanent reduction in the combined companys variable rate borrowings this
fundamental change in our debt portfolio resulted in the existing derivative
portfolio no longer being aligned with the debt portfolio and prompted us to
eliminate all existing interest rate swaps and cap agreements at a pretax cost
of 17 million

      we now use derivatives primarily to fix the rates on variable rate debt
and set interest rates for future debt issuances to do this we use the
following guidelines

       limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the
        amount of variable rate debt to a combined total of 23 billion or
        less

       use the average daily bank balance to determine annual variable rate
        debt amounts

       include no leveraged derivative products and

       hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current
        marktomarket status

      we review compliance with the guidelines annually with the financial
policy committee of our board of directors in addition our internal auditors
review compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis the guidelines may
change as our business needs dictate

      the table below provides information about our interest rate derivative
and underlying debt portfolio the amount shown for each year represents the
contractual maturities of longterm debt excluding capital leases and the
outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives interest rates reflect
the weighted average for the outstanding instruments the variable component of
each interest rate derivative and the variable rated debt is based on one month

       if the three month libor is greater than 410 and less than or equal to
        650 we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period

       if the three month libor is greater than 650 and less than 750 we
        pay 650 for that three month period and

       if the three month libor is greater than or equal to 750 we pay the
        actual interest rate for that three month period

      the interest rate caps all have a strike price of 68 based on the one
