during 2021 inflation in materials energy transportation and labor has impacted the company’s profitability across all segments mohawk has to some extent offset the impact of inflationary pressures through multiple pricing actions across product categories and geographies improved mix from sales of highervalue differentiated products and productivity gains in manufacturing and logistics in the near future the company might not foresee significant changes in these external pressures which could have an adverse impact on the company’s results in europe natural gas prices accelerated at an unprecedented pace due to supply shortages and are presently more than five times higher than last year given the unexpected acceleration of natural gas expenses the european flooring industry will require some time to align product prices with higher energy costs which could result from pricing actions deescalation of energy costs or a combination of the two factors the duration of the natural gas price spike is unpredictable and the company will explore all options to manage the impact of energy inflation while continuing to deliver service to customers but this energy inflation could impact future results of operations

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

index to financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

• accounts receivable and revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods the nature of the promised goods are ceramic stone carpet resilient laminate wood and other flooring products payment is typically received 90 days or less from the invoice date the company adjusts the amounts of revenue for expected cash discounts sales allowances returns and claims based upon historical experience the company adjusts accounts receivable for doubtful account allowances based upon relevant information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable if the company expects the financial condition of the company’s customers to deteriorate based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts additional allowances may be required a 10 change in the company’s allowance for discounts returns claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately 6 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

• inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost has been determined using the firstin firstout method “fifo” costs included in inventory include raw materials direct and indirect labor and employee benefits depreciation general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing market with respect to all inventories is replacement cost or net realizable value inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage which is a function of historical usage anticipated future selling price expected sales below cost excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and a 10 change in the company’s assumptions for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

• acquisition accounting the fair value of the consideration the company pays for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate including the fair value of certain forms of consideration fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the acquired assets the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm rates of growth for the business the impact of prior or future acquisitions on the company’s financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates see note 2 acquisitions included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions 

• goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value among other factors when reviewing for indicators of impairment the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches the company has identified global ceramic flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital “wacc” and comparable company market multiples when developing these key judgments and assumptions the company considers economic operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit however estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will in all likelihood differ in some respects from actual future results should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur such as declines in spending for new construction remodeling and replacement activities the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers or a decline in comparable company market multiples then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted generally a decline in estimated after tax cash flows greater than approximately 24 to 43 or a percentage increase of approximately 22 to 60 in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 

index to financial statements 

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2021 while the company has concluded that neither goodwill nor any of its indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired during the year ended december 31 2021 a prolonged pandemic could impact the company’s assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the company’s reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets significantly enough to trigger an impairment 

• income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating the company’s tax positions deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income inherently rely on estimates including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance is provided the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted for further information regarding the company’s valuation allowances see note 15 income taxes included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic “asc” 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 15 income taxes included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

• environmental and legal accruals environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings as disclosed in the company’s consolidated financial statements in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable the company consults with its internal experts the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it 

recent accounting pronouncements

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleumbased to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material labor energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its global ceramic segment the second quarter typically sees higher net sales followed by the third and first quarters while the fourth quarter shows weaker net sales for the segment’s operating income generally the second quarter shows stronger earnings followed by third and first quarters and the fourth quarter shows weaker earnings the flooring na segment’s second quarter typically produces higher net sales followed by moderate third and fourth quarters and a weaker first quarter for the segment’s operating income historically the third quarter shows stronger earnings followed by second and fourth quarters and a weaker first quarter the flooring row segment’s second quarter historically typically produces higher net sales followed by moderate fourth and third quarters and a weaker first quarter for the segment’s operating income generally the second quarter shows stronger earnings followed by first and third quarters and the fourth quarter shows weaker earnings 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy and has led to unpredictable economic activity and impacted the supply chain for raw materials and sourced finished goods the company expects the impact of the covid19 pandemic to continue to impact normal seasonality trends into 2022 but the extent and duration of such impact cannot be predicted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1r “hedges of net investments in nonus operations” of the company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 74 of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 26 was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the company’s variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 would be approximately 5 million or 007 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the australian dollar the brazilian real the new zealand dollar and the canadian dollar 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2021 a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 54 million

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information provided in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the company’s common stock if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

industry and economic risks 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence income and spending corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing significant or prolonged declines in the us or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

downturns in the us and global economies including as a result of the covid19 pandemic negatively impact the floor covering industry and the company’s business during times of economic uncertainty or decline end consumers tend to spend less on remodeling their homes which is how the company derives a majority of its sales likewise new home construction  and the corresponding need for new flooring materials  tends to slow down during recessionary periods there may be downturns in the foreseeable future that could cause the industry to deteriorate globally or in the local markets in which the company operates a significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the company’s competition is from companies located outside of the united states and these competitors may benefit from lower input costs or state subsidies also trade tariffs may impact both the company and its competitors in different and unpredictable ways maintaining the company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products force the company to lower prices or prevent the company from raising prices to keep up with inflation moreover fluctuations in currency exchange rates and input costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the company’s products which may put pressure on the company’s pricing any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the covid19 pandemic has materially impacted our business and will likely continue to impact our business in the future 

mohawk generates sales in more than 170 countries and maintains manufacturing operations in 18 countries due to its large global footprint mohawk’s business is sensitive to macroeconomic events in the united states and abroad while the nearterm economic and financial impact of the covid19 pandemic is continuing to evolve and difficult to measure based on current visibility the company expects that it will continue to see fluctuating demand across a number of its markets in particular pent up demand for travel and entertainment may reduce consumer willingness to make investments in the company’s products as health conditions improve also the company has experienced and may continue to experience plant closures or slowdowns in productivity resulting from lower demand healthbased concerns and government mandated closures 

during economic downturns including the current downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic demand for the company’s products may significantly decrease this reduced demand may lead to lower sales and intensified competitive pressures 

index to financial statements 

the company experienced certain disruptions to its business and further disruptions may occur that could materially affect the company’s ability to obtain supplies manufacture its products or deliver inventory in a timely manner future disruptions may result in lost revenue additional costs or impairments to goodwill or other assets although we believe that we can manage our exposure to these risks there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future the company continues to follow the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees suppliers customers and other stakeholders the company has implemented business continuity plans during the crisis and is attempting to minimize the pandemic’s impact but it may be unable to adequately respond to further outbreaks in particular geographies and its operations may be materially impacted the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact the company’s results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the successful implementation of vaccination programs and the continued fiscal support currently provided by governments in the company’s markets accordingly the covid19 pandemic and the related global reaction could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2020 was 17698 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 14188 million for the year ended 2019 this increase of 3511 million was primarily attributable to changes in working capital partially offset by lower net earnings the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019 as compared to 2018 of 2374 million was primarily attributable to changes in working capital partially offset by lower net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2020 was 9548 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 6160 million for the year ended 2019 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the purchases of shortterm investments of 5397 million net of redemption of shortterm investments partially offset by reduced capital expenditures of 1199 million and a decrease in acquisition costs of 811 million net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2019 was 6160 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 13322 million for the year ended 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 4879 million reduction in acquisitions and a 2486 million reduction in capital expenditures 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 2020 was 1882 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 7899 million for the year ended 2019 the change in cash used in financing is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the senior notes of 7353 million net of repayments of 3269 million partially offset by the increase in purchases of the company’s shares of 885 million net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 2019 was 7899 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1980 million for the year ended 2018 the change in cash used in financing is primarily attributable to lower borrowings of commercial paper of 8606 million

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

index to financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

• accounts receivable and revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods the nature of the promised goods are ceramic stone carpet resilient laminate wood and other flooring products payment is typically received 90 days or less from the invoice date the company adjusts the amounts of revenue for expected cash discounts sales allowances returns and claims based upon historical experience the company adjusts accounts receivable for doubtful account allowances based upon relevant information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable if the company expects the financial condition of the company’s customers to deteriorate based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts additional allowances may be required a 10 change in the company’s allowance for discounts returns claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately 7 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

• inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost has been determined using the firstin firstout method “fifo” costs included in inventory include raw materials direct and indirect labor and employee benefits depreciation general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing market with respect to all inventories is replacement cost or net realizable value inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage which is a function of historical usage anticipated future selling price expected sales below cost excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and a 10 change in the company’s assumptions for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

• acquisition accounting the fair value of the consideration the company pays for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate including the fair value of certain forms of consideration fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the acquired assets the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm rates of growth for the business the impact of prior or future acquisitions on the company’s financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates see note 2 acquisitions included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions 

• goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value among other factors when reviewing for indicators of impairment the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches the company has identified global ceramic flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital “wacc” and comparable company market multiples when developing these key judgments and assumptions the company considers economic operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit however estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will in all likelihood differ in some respects from actual future results should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur such as declines in spending for new construction remodeling and replacement activities the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers or a decline in comparable company market multiples then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted generally a decline in estimated after tax cash flows greater than approximately10 to 33 or a percentage increase of approximately 7 to 38 in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 

index to financial statements 

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2020 while the company has concluded that neither goodwill nor any of its indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired during the year ended december 31 2020 a prolonged pandemic could impact the company’s assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the company’s reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets significantly enough to trigger an impairment hence the company continues to monitor the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic and may be required to reassess impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets in future interim periods 

• income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating the company’s tax positions deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income inherently rely on estimates including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance is provided the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted for further information regarding the company’s valuation allowances see note 15 income taxes included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic “asc” 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 15 income taxes included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

index to financial statements 

• environmental and legal accruals environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings as disclosed in the company’s consolidated financial statements in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable the company consults with its internal experts the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1y “summary of significant accounting policies” of the company’s accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates or expected dates of adoption and effects or expected effects on the company’s disclosures results of operations and financial condition 

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its global ceramic segment the second quarter typically sees highest net sales followed by the third and fourth quarters while the first quarter shows weakest net sales for the segment’s operating income generally the second quarter shows the strongest earnings followed by third and first quarters and the fourth quarter shows weakest earnings the flooring na segment’s third quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by moderate second and fourth quarters and a weakest first quarter the flooring row segment’s fourth quarter historically typically produces the highest net sales followed by moderate third and second quarters and a weakest first quarter for the segment’s operating income generally the second quarter shows the strongest earnings followed by third and first quarters and the fourth quarter shows weakest earnings 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy and has led to reduced economic activity employment disruptions and supply chain constraints the company expects the impact of the covid19 pandemic to continue to impact normal seasonality trends into 2021 but the extent and duration of such impact cannot be predicted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1r “hedges of net investments in nonus operations” of the company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 87 of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 13 was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the company’s variable rate debt as of december 31 2020 would be approximately 3 million or 004 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the brazilian real 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2020 a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 41 million

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 



index to financial statements 

accounts receivable if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required a 10 change in the company’s allowance for discounts returns claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million for the year ended december 31 2019  

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such 

index to financial statements 

assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2019  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic “asc” 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 14 income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1n “hedges of net investments in nonus operations” of the company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 46 of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 54 was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the company’s variable rate debt as of december 31 2019 would be approximately 12 million or  016 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the brazilian real 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2019  a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 44 million

negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the company ’ s business 

the company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in calculating the provision for income taxes the company must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions however it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and ongoing assessments of the company’s tax exposures

in particular the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment recycling and disposal of materials and finished product the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations for example the company’s manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns while the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted a “capandtrade” system similar to the system that applies to the company’s businesses in the european union could be adopted in the united states the company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy especially natural gas any such “capandtrade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require the company to increase our capital expenditures use its cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events 

many of the company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations these facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes or by fire or other unexpected events the company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to its reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on its business

index to financial statements 

moreover adverse publicity arising from claims made against the company even if the claims are not successful could adversely affect the company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products 

the company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us countries in the european union and elsewhere as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

third parties may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 

the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business would be materially and adversely affected 

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results

the company ’ s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future the company the flooring industry and the stock market have experienced stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies additionally price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time 

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

a significant or prolonged decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

index to financial statements 

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

index to financial statements 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2018  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic “asc” 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 13income taxes

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its flooring na and global ceramic segments the second quarter typically sees the higher net sales and operating income followed by the first and third quarters the results of operations for the fourth quarter tends to be the weakest these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following the flooring row segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net earnings followed by moderate first and third quarters and a weaker fourth quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1n “hedges of net investments in nonus operations” of the company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 36  of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 64  was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the company’s variable rate debt as of december 31 2018  would be approximately 21 million or 018 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the brazilian real 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2018  a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 43 million

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results

in december of 2017 the us and belgium enacted tax reform legislation the us legislation the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” is the most significant and complex change to the us tax law in more than 30 years the most significant provisions of the tcja were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 implementation of a territorial income tax regime and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the company’s foreign subsidiaries the most significant provisions of the belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3399 to 2958 for january 1 2018 and january 1 2019 respectively with a further reduction to 25 effective january 1 2020 an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime 

accordingly for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded a net tax expense of 08 million related primarily to the noncash tax benefit of the revaluation of its belgian deferred tax liabilities the noncash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its us deferred tax liabilities and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the deemed repatriation transition tax this represents the best estimate of the impact of all tax law changes on the company’s financial statements the company will continue to evaluate the interpretations of the tcja the assumptions made within the calculations and future guidance that may be issued to determine the impact if any on these provisional calculations which may materially change the company’s tax determinations 

as for certain other corporate income tax aspects of the tcja specifically the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision the company has been unable to quantify the impacts of these provisions due to the inherent complexities involved accordingly the company expects to continue to analyze these provisions and their potential impacts and record any such amounts as determined during the course of 2018 see note 12income taxes

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 



index to financial statements 

assured the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts sales allowances returns claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required a 10 change in the company’s allowance for discounts returns claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past 

index to financial statements 

performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2017  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 12income taxes

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its flooring na and global ceramic segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following the flooring row segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and fourth quarter and a weaker third quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1n hedges of net investments in nonus operations of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 43  of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 57  was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2017  would be approximately 16 million or 014 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the malaysian ringgit 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2017  a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 43 million

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

index to financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

index to financial statements 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2016  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016  the company has 464 million  accrued for uncertain tax positions for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 12income taxes

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its flooring na and global ceramic segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following the flooring row segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and fourth quarter and a weaker third quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in note 1o hedges of net investments in nonus operations of our accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 45  of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 55  was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2016  would be approximately 14 million or 012 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the malaysian ringgit 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2016 a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 42 million

critical accounting policies

index to financial statements 

of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies

impacted generally a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 35  or a more than 28  increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2015

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the malaysian ringgit 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on financial results for the year ended december 31 2015 a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro and russian ruble would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 31 million

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing significant or prolonged declines in the us or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

downturns in the us and global economies along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies negatively impact the floor covering industry and the company’s business the company derives a majority of its sales from the replacement segment of the market followed by sales associated with new construction activities although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity these activities lagged in the most recent downturn although the difficult economic conditions have improved in the us european and other markets have not recovered as quickly and there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future a significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations

the company may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately or to respond to technological developments 

  

the company operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors maintaining the company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products or force the company to lower prices moreover a strong us dollar combined with lower fuel costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the company’s products which may put pressure on the company’s pricing any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

changes in the global economy could affect the company’s overall availability and cost of credit 

despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions in the us continued weakness elsewhere in the world or changes in market conditions could impact the company’s ability to obtain financing in the future including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness the cost and availability of credit during uncertain economic times could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

further negative economic conditions may factor into the company’s periodic credit ratings assessment by moody’s investors service inc moodys standard  poor’s financial services llc sp and fitch inc any future changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength and any downgrades in the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future the company can provide no assurances that downgrades will not occur 

if the company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in its existing credit facilities it may be required to repay borrowings under the credit facilities prior to their maturity and may lose access to the credit facilities for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations and growth strategy

during the term of the credit facilities if the company’s cash flow is worse than expected or the us trade accounts receivables are lower than expected the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness through a public andor private debt offering or a new bank facility and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it or at all if the company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption or weakness in the companys businesses the company’s ability to finance its operations or repay existing debt obligations may be materially and adversely affected 

additionally the credit facilities include certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the company’s financial and business operations including limitations on liens indebtedness investments fundamental changes asset dispositions dividends and other similar restricted payments transactions with affiliates payments and modifications of certain existing debt future negative pledges and changes in the nature of the company’s business in addition the 2013 senior credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and a consolidated

net leverage ratio of no more than 375 to 10 a failure to comply with the obligations contained in our current or future credit facilities or indentures relating to our outstanding public debt could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions we cannot be certain that we would have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 

the 2013 senior credit facility is scheduled to mature on september 25 2018  however the maturity date will accelerate resulting in the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs to october 16 2015  if on that date any of the companys 6125  notes due january 15 2016  remains outstanding and the company has not delivered to the administrative agent a certificate demonstrating that after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in cash in full on that date of all of the 6125  notes that remain outstanding the amount the company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 senior credit facility together with the aggregate consolidated amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the company would exceed 2000 million  while there can be no assurance the company currently believes that if any of the 6125  notes remains outstanding on october 16 2015  the amount the company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 senior credit facility together with the aggregate consolidated amount of the company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents would exceed 2000 million  on october 16 2015

changes in any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse affect on the company’s business 

negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the companys business 

the company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in calculating the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions however it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to costs liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company is subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws regulations and licensing requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the company conducts business the company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with such laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the united states 

in particular the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment recycling and disposal of materials and finished product the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations for example our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns while the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted a “capandtrade” system similar to the system that applies to our businesses in the european union could be adopted in the united states the company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy especially natural gas any such “capandtrade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations which could have a material adverse affect on our business 

the company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events 

many of the company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations these facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes or by fire or other unexpected events the company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to its reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on its business

the company may be exposed to litigation claims and other legal proceedings in the relating to its products which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to a variety of productrelated claims lawsuits and legal proceedings including those relating to product liability product warranty product recall personal injury and other matters a very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on the companys business if the company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the company or settlements relating to these matters although the company has product liability insurance the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities further the company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels moreover adverse publicity arising from claims made against the company even if the claims are not successful could adversely affect the company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products 

the company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or collect license revenues with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the profit margins of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain maintain and license proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us countries in the european union and elsewhere as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic and pergo family of patents which protects its interlocking laminate flooring technology the company generates license revenue from these patents which are expected to expire in 2017 and 2021 respectively the company continues to develop new sources of revenue to offset the expiration of its revenueproducing patents the failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

in addition the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the companys technology without the companys authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the companys patents the use of the companys technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the company’s business 

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue

third parties may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

as a result the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business would be materially and adversely affected 

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and innovation and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange frequently issue new requirements and regulations the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

a significant or prolonged decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

index to financial statements 

in economic conditions occur such as declines in spending for new construction remodeling and replacement activities the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers or a decline in comparable company market multiples then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted generally a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 23  or a more than 15  increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2014  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014  the company has 496 million  accrued for uncertain tax positions for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its carpet and ceramic segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following the laminate and wood segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and third quarter and a weaker forth quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the company’s risk management program which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes the company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 55  of the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 45  was floatingrate debt the company believes that probable nearterm changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition results of operations or cash flows the annual impact on interest expense of a onepercentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 would be approximately 10000 or 08 to diluted eps 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as a result of being a global enterprise there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the russian ruble the mexican peso the canadian dollar the australian dollar the british pound and the malaysian ringgit 

  

the company’s objective is to balance where possible nonfunctional currency denominated assets to nonfunctional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations these transactions 

generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

the company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 

  

based on 2014 financial results for the year ended december 31 2014 a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the us dollar against the euro and russian ruble would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately 30 million

the company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in calculating the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions however it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to costs liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company and its customers and suppliers are subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws regulations and licensing requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the company conducts business the company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with such laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the united states 

further the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment recycling and disposal of materials and finished product the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations for example our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns while the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted a “capandtrade” system similar to the system that applies to our businesses in the european union could be adopted in the united states the company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy especially natural gas any such “capandtrade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events 

many of the company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations these facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes or by fire or other unexpected events the company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to its reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may be exposed to litigation claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to its products which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to a variety of productrelated claims lawsuits and legal proceedings including those relating to product liability product warranty product recall personal injury and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the company such matters could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments 

against the company or settlements relating to these matters although the company has product liability insurance the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities further the company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels moreover adverse publicity arising from claims made against the company even if the claims are not successful could adversely affect the company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products

the company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or collect license revenues particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and its registered trademarks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain maintain and license proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us countries in the european union and elsewhere as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic and pergo family of patents which protects its interlocking laminate flooring technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the company’s business 

the company generates license revenue from certain patents in the uniclic and pergo families that are not expected to expire until 2017 and 2021 respectively the company continues to develop new sources of revenue to offset the expiration of its uniclic and pergo family of patents the failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

third parties may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses for disputed 

index to financial statements 

technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and innovation and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange frequently issue new requirements and regulations the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

a significant or prolonged decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

index to financial statements 

developing these key judgments and assumptions the company considers economic operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit however estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will in all likelihood differ in some respects from actual future results should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur such as declines in spending for new construction remodeling and replacement activities the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers or a decline in comparable company market multiples then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted generally a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 25  or a more than 10  increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2013  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the

largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013  the company has 565 million  accrued for uncertain tax positions for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we have reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or that no material effect is expected as a result of future adoption 

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its carpet and ceramic segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following the laminate and wood segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate third and fourth quarter and a weaker first quarter

we are subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in calculating the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions however it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to costs liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company and its customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and licensing requirements the company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state and local laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the united states 

further the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment recycling and disposal of materials and 

index to financial statements 

finished product the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations for example enactment of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the us congress or various states or the adoption of regulations by the environmental protection agency and analogous state or foreign governmental agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which the company conducts business could have an adverse effect on its operations and demand for its products the company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy especially natural gas increased regulation of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the nature of the company’s business and operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

the company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events 

many of the company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations these facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes or by fire or other unexpected events the company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to its reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may be exposed to litigation claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to its products which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to a variety of productrelated claims lawsuits and legal proceedings including those relating to product liability product warranty product recall personal injury and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the company such matters could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments 

against the company or settlements relating to these matters although the company has product liability insurance the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities further the company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels moreover adverse publicity arising from claims made against the company even if the claims are not successful could adversely affect the company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products 

the company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or collect license revenues particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and its registered trademarks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain maintain and license proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic and pergo family of patents which protects its interlocking laminate flooring technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization through license agreements independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the 

company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not 

index to financial statements 

obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which could have a material effect on the company’s business 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the company’s business 

the company generates license revenue from certain patents in the uniclic and pergo families that are not expected to expire until 2017 and 2021 respectively the company continues to develop new sources of revenue to offset the expiration in its uniclic and pergo family of patents the failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past companies have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that the company’s products infringe or may infringe those parties’ intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and innovation and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

index to financial statements

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

a significant or prolonged decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

index to financial statements 

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be 

index to financial statements 

held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2012  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 74010 for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2012  the company has 538 million  accrued for uncertain tax positions for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment’s second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic family of patents which protects unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization through license agreements independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which could have a material effect on the company’s business

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge

    critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

  

index to financial statements the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

  

  

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

  

index to financial statements the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2011 

 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic 740 “asc 74010” for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2011 the company has 461 million accrued for uncertain tax positions for further information regarding the company’s uncertain tax positions see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the company expects raw material prices many of which are petroleum based to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company’s production processes although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered in the past the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer 

  

index to financial statements residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

certain factors affecting the company’s performance 

 

in addition to the other information provided in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the company’s common stock 

 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the downturn in the us and global economies beginning in 2006 along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business while overall economic conditions and the housing and flooring industries have begun to show signs of recovering this improvement may be temporary and economic conditions may deteriorate in the foreseeable future further significant or prolonged declines in such economies or in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

the floor covering industry in which the company participates is highly dependent on general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the company derives a majority of its sales from the 

replacement segment of the market therefore economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

 

the floor covering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity including new construction which is cyclical in nature and currently in a downturn the downturn in the us and global economies along with the housing markets in such economies negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity these activities have also lagged during the downturn while overall economic conditions and the housing and flooring industries have begun to show signs of recovering this improvement may be temporary and economic conditions may deteriorate in the foreseeable future a significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

 

in periods of rising costs the company may be unable to pass raw materials energy and fuelrelated cost increases on to its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

 

the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs could vary significantly with market conditions although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material energy and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time the company’s profitability may be materially adversely affected 

 

uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the global economy and the company’s business could affect the company’s overall availability and cost of credit 

 

uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the overall availability and cost of credit despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions the impact of the economic downturn on the company’s ability to obtain financing including any financing necessary to refinance its existing senior unsecured notes in the future and the cost and terms of it remains uncertain these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and on its financial condition and operating results further these generally negative economic and business conditions may factor into the company’s periodic credit ratings assessment by either or both moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a rating agency’s evaluation is based on a number of factors which include scale and diversification brand strength profitability leverage liquidity and interest coverage during 2009 the company’s senior unsecured notes were downgraded by the rating agencies which increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 02 million per quarter per 100 million of outstanding notes and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future additional downgrades in the company’s credit ratings could further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future and the company can provide no assurances that additional downgrades will not occur 

 

the company has a significant level of indebtedness that must be repaid or refinanced in addition if the company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in the abl facility it may be required to repay borrowings under the abl facility prior to their maturity and may lose access to the abl facility for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations 

 

the company’s outstanding 720 senior notes in the aggregate amount of 4000 million are due april 15 2012 the company’s 6000 million fouryear senior secured revolving credit facility the “abl facility” is scheduled to mature on september 2 2013 but the maturity date will accelerate including the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs to january 15 2012 if the company’s outstanding 720 senior notes due april 15 2012 have not been repaid refinanced defeased or adequately reserved for by the company as reasonably determined by the administrative agent prior to january 15 2012 the company believes it will be able to make adequate reserves for such senior notes with cash and cash 

equivalents unutilized borrowing availability under the abl facility and other financing sources including public debt markets or new bank facilities as of december 31 2010 the amount utilized under the abl facility was 3871 million resulting in a total of 1696 million available under the abl facility the amount utilized included the reserved amount of 2800 million related to the repayment of the company’s outstanding 575 senior notes due january 15 2011 535 million of standby letters of credit guaranteeing the company’s industrial revenue bonds and 535 million of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments immediately following the repayment of the 575 senior notes due january 15 2011 at maturity a total of 2896 million was available under the abl facility while the company currently believes it has access to other uncommitted financing sources including public debt markets to satisfy the january 15 2012 requirements under the abl facility and the subsequent repayment of the 720 senior notes due april 15 2012 there can be no assurances that the company will be able to complete any necessary financing transactions prior to the relevant date under the abl facility or the april 15 2012 maturity date 

 

if the company’s cash flow is worse than expected or the borrowing base on its abl facility declines the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness in the public debt markets and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it or at all if the company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption or other factors it could materially adversely affect the company’s ability to repay its indebtedness and otherwise have a substantial adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

additionally the company’s credit facilities require it to meet certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on its financial and business operations including limitations relating to debt investments asset dispositions and changes in the nature of its business the company is also required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 11 to 10 during any period that the unutilized amount available under the abl facility is less than 15 of the amount available under the abl facility failure to comply with these covenants could materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to finance its operations or capital needs and to engage in other activities that may be in the company’s best interest 

 

the company faces intense competition in the flooring industry which could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products or force the company to lower prices any of these factors or others may impact demand which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

the principal raw materials used in the company’s manufacturing operations include nylon polypropylene triexta and polyester resins and fibers which are used primarily in the company’s carpet and rugs business clay talc nepheline syenite and glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in the company’s ceramic tile business wood paper and resins which are used primarily in the company’s laminate flooring business for certain of such raw materials the company is dependent on one or a small number of suppliers an adverse change in the company’s relationship with such a supplier the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials to the company could lead to an interruption of supply or require the company to purchase more expensive alternatives an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company’s operations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the company’s financial periods 

 

the results of the company’s foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into us dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for the statement of operations accounts using principally the company’s average rates during the period the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future the company may not be able to manage effectively the company’s currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the company’s results between financial periods 

 

the company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments 

 

the company has typically grown its business through acquisitions growth through acquisitions involves risks many of which may continue to affect the company after the acquisition the company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue profitability and production that the company expects the combination of an acquired company’s business with the company’s existing businesses involves risks the company cannot be assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or incurrence of debt the company may also face challenges in consolidating functions integrating the company’s organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel these challenges may result in 

 

  

the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues level of expenses and operating results 

 

failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations even if integration occurs successfully failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth profitability or productivity or otherwise perform as expected may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition we have made certain investments including through joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

as part of the company’s business strategy the company intends to continue to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of complementary businesses as well as strategic investments and joint ventures although the company regularly evaluates such opportunities the company may not be able successfully to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic transactions to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the company’s existing businesses or to manage profitably acquired businesses or strategic investments 

 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to costs liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations which could be significant 

 

the company and its customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and licensing requirements the company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state and local laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the united states 

 

further the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment recycling and disposal of materials and finished product the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations for example enactment of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the us congress or various states or the adoption of regulations by the epa and analogous state or foreign governmental agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which the company conducts business could have an adverse effect on its operations and demand for its products the company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy especially natural gas increased regulation of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse gases and climate change could materially increase the company’s manufacturing costs 

 

the nature of the company’s business and operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

 

the company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events 

 

many of the company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations these facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes or by fire or other unexpected events the company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to its reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on its business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the company may be exposed to litigation claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to its products which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 

 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to a variety of productrelated claims lawsuits and legal proceedings including those relating to product liability product warranty product recall personal injury and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the company such matters could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its 

insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the company or settlements relating to these matters although the company has product liability insurance the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities further the company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels moreover adverse publicity arising from claims made against the company even if the claims were not successful could adversely affect the company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products 

 

the company manufactures sources and sells many products internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

the company’s manufacturing facilities in mexico and europe represent a significant portion of the company’s capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring respectively and the company’s european operations represent a significant source of the company’s revenues and profits the business regulatory and political environments in these countries differ from those in the us in addition the company increasingly sells products operates plants and invests in companies in other parts of the world the company’s international sales operations and investments are subject to risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

the company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or upon its financial condition and results of operations 

 

if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and its registered trademarks the company’s business and prospects could be harmed 

 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic ® family of patents which protects unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

 

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

 

in the past companies have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that the company’s products infringe or may infringe those parties’ intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or 

intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the securities and exchange commission and new york stock exchange frequently issue new requirements and regulations the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

 

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

 

a decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a shortterm decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value in 2008 the company’s goodwill and other intangible assets suffered an impairment and additional impairment charges could occur in future periods 

 

the longterm performance of the company’s business relies on its ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

 

to be successful the company must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing product design and innovation and operations and as it considers entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with those markets the company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the company’s competitive position and its operating results

combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies this restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property the step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that based on the available evidence at the time the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized the deferred tax asset recognized as of december 31 2007 was approximately 245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 272 million

company’s interest expense by approximately 01 million per quarter per 100 million of outstanding notes currently the interest rates have been increased by an aggregate amount of 075 as a result of downgrades by moody’s and standard  poor’s during 2009 additional downgrades in the company’s credit ratings could further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future

critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

  

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to 

ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things

seasonality 

 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce 

higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

regulatory decisions could cause the prices of fuel and energy to fluctuate and any price increases that result may reduce results of operations 

 

the company’s manufacturing operations and shipping needs require high inputs of energy including the use of substantial amounts of electricity natural gas and petroleum based products which are subject to price fluctuations due to changes in supply and demand and are also affected by local national and international regulatory decisions significant increases in the cost of these commodities either as a result of changes in market prices due to regulatory decisions or as a result of additional costs in order to comply with regulatory decisions may have adverse effects on the company’s results of operations and cash flows if the company is unable to pass such increases to its customers in a timely manner 

changes in laws or in the business political and regulatory environments in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

the company’s manufacturing facilities in mexico and europe represent a significant portion of the company’s capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring respectively and the company’s european operations represent a significant source of the company’s revenues and profits accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on either of these operations or that changes the current tax treatment of the results thereof could have a material adverse effect on the company the business regulatory and political environments in mexico and europe differ from those in the us and the company’s mexican and european operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to the countries in which they occur particularly with respect to labor regulations which tend to be more stringent in europe and to a lesser extent mexico the company cannot assure investors that the company will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or upon the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

if the company is unable to protect the company’s intellectual property rights particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and the company’s registered trademarks the company’s business and prospects could be harmed 

 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic ® family of patents which protects unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

 

the company generally requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances 

the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

 

in the past companies have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that the company’s products infringe or may infringe those parties’ intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorney’s fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nyse frequently issue new requirements and regulations such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

 

declines in the company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material noncash charge 

 

a decrease in the company’s market capitalization including a shortterm decline in stock price or a negative longterm performance outlook could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the company’s assets exceed their fair value in 2008 the company’s goodwill and other intangible assets suffered an impairment and additional impairment charges could occur in future periods

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly owned european entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in europe the company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to unilin and the move allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies this restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property the step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that based on the available evidence at the time the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized the deferred tax asset recognized as of december 31 2007 was approximately 245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 272 million 

 

during the third quarter of 2008 the company reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets cash flows had decreased from that projected as of december 31 2007 primarily due to the slowing worldwide economy and declining sales volume the company determined that given the current 

and expected economic conditions and the corresponding reductions in cash flows its ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the transaction described above as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not accordingly the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the amount of 253 million during the quarter ended september 27 2008

critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

 28 

  

the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 

 

the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

 

the company reviews its longlived asset groups which include intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups if such asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 

 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated the company did record impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of 15434 million in 2008 

 

 29 

  

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available as of the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb accounting standards codification topic 740 “asc 74010” a replacement of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109”  for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2009 the company has 1056 million accrued for uncertain tax positions

seasonality 

 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

competition 

the principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service style quality price and to a certain extent product innovation and technology in each of the markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines in the mohawk and daltile segments the investments in advanced manufacturing computer systems the extensive diversity of equipment as well as the company’s marketing strategy and distribution system contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price the company is one of the largest carpet and rug manufacturers in the world while the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented the company believes it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own north american distribution system in the laminate flooring market the company believes it has a competitive advantage as a result of unilin’s industry leading design and patented technologies which allows the company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish quality installation and assembly the company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring market from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers

 item 1a risk factors tableend certain factors affecting the company’s performance

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the current uncertainty in the credit markets downturns in the global economy and the company’s business could affect the overall availability and cost of credit 

the current uncertainty in the credit markets could also limit demand for our products and affect the overall availability and cost of credit at this time it is unclear whether and to what extent the actions taken by the us government and other measures currently being implemented or contemplated will mitigate the effects of the situation while we do not anticipate any immediate need to access the credit markets the impact of the current situation on our ability to obtain financing in the future and the cost and terms of it is uncertain these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results further these generally negative economic and business conditions may factor into our periodic credit ratings assessment by either or both moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services the rating agency’s evaluation is based on a number of factors which include scale and diversification brand strength profitability leverage liquidity and interest coverage on november 7 2008 moody’s investors service inc announced that it placed the company’s baa3 long term rating on review for possible downgrade on february 25 2009 moody’s investors service inc announced that it had downgraded its ratings on the company’s senior unsecured notes to ba1 from baa3 and was maintaining a negative rating outlook following the completion of its rating review this downgrade will increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 35 million per year and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future additional downgrades in the company’s credit rating could further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future and the company can provide no assurances that additional downgrades will not occur additionally our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants including certain debt to capitalization ratios failure to comply with these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs and to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the current downturn in the us and global economies along with the housing markets in such economies has negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business these difficult economic conditions may continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable future further significant or prolonged declines in such economies or in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the floor covering industry in which the company participates is highly dependent on general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the company derives a majority of the company’s sales from the 

  

index to financial statements replacement segment of the market therefore economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity including new construction which is cyclical in nature and currently in a downturn the current downturn in the us and global economies along with the housing markets in such economies has negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity these activities have also lagged during the current downturn the difficult economic conditions may continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable future a significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

in periods of rising costs the company may be unable to pass cost increases of raw materials and fuelrelated costs on to its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs vary with market conditions although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time the company’s profitability may be materially adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in the flooring industry which could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products or force the company to lower prices any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business

the company reported net loss of 14582 million or diluted loss earnings per share “eps” of 2132 for 2008 compared to net earnings of 7068 million and 1032 eps for 2007 the change in eps resulted primarily from a 15434 million pretax impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles a charge of 253 million to record a tax valuation allowance against the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 lower sales volumes rising raw material and energy costs and business restructurings during 2008 the company paid down approximately 333 million in debt 

the company believes that industry demand for the products manufactured by the company will continue to be impacted by the softened demand that began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and worsened considerably during the later parts of 2008 the global economy continues in the most significant downturn in recent history overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment have continued to deteriorate which has intensified the pressure on the demand for housing and as a result the company’s products as the company slowed production and raw materials purchases in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory in response to reduced demand the proportion of higher cost products in inventory increased consequently the company anticipates that its margins and earnings will be negatively impacted until demand for the company’s products increases and the portion of higher cost products in inventory declines as higher cost inventory flows through earnings 

although the company cannot determine with certainty as to when the deteriorating market conditions will stabilize and begin to improve the company believes it is wellpositioned in the longterm as the industry improves the company continues to monitor expenses and manufacturing capacity based on current industry conditions and will continue to adjust as required

interest expense 

interest expense for 2008 was 1271 million compared to 1545 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense for 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to lower average debt and lower average interest rates on outstanding revolving debt 

income tax benefit expense 

the 2008 provision for income tax was 1801 million as compared to an income tax benefit of 1027 million for 2007 the effective tax rate for 2008 was 141 as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 170 for 2007 the change in the tax rate was primarily due to the impact on pretax earnings of the impairment charge on nondeductible goodwill the 2008 business restructurings and the recognition of a valuation allowance of 253 million which is described below against certain deferred tax assets that the company believes is no longer more likely than not to be realized without the impact of these three items the company would have reflected a 2008 provision for income tax of 705 million as compared to a provision of 1689 million for 2007 which excludes a tax benefit of approximately 272 million from the european restructuring described below 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly owned european entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in europe the company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to unilin and the move allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies this restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property the step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that based on the available evidence the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized the deferred tax asset recognized at december 31 2007 was approximately 245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements was approximately 272 million 

  

index to financial statements during the third quarter of 2008 the company reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets actual cash flows have been less than those projected as of december 31 2007 primarily due to the slowing worldwide economy and declining sales volume the company determined that given the current and expected economic conditions and the corresponding reductions in cash flows its ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the european restructuring transaction described above as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not accordingly during the third quarter of 2008 the company recorded a 253 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset created as a result of the european restructuring

interest expense 

interest expense for 2007 was 1545 million compared to 1737 million in 2006 the decrease in interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 was attributable to lower average debt partially offset by higher interest rates in 2007 when compared to 2006 

income tax benefit expense 

the company had an income tax benefit of 1027 million or 170 of earnings before income taxes for 2007 compared to an income tax expense of 2205 million or 326 of earnings before income taxes for 2006 during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company implemented a change in residency of one of its foreign subsidiaries the company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly owned european entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in europe the company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to unilin and the move allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies this restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property the step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that based on the available evidence the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized the deferred tax asset recognized at december 31 2007 was approximately 245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements was approximately 272 million the recognition of the deferred tax asset resulted in a reduction in the company’s effective tax rate for the year in addition the tax rate also decreased due to a greater percentage of income in lower taxed jurisdictions and changes implemented in the third quarter of 2007 which resulted in higher interest deductions outside the us 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary capital requirements are for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the company’s capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds bank credit lines term and senior notes the sale of trade receivables and credit terms from suppliers 

  

index to financial statements cash flows generated by operations for 2008 were 5700 million compared to 8751 million for 2007 the decrease in operating cash flows for 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to lower earnings as a result of declining business conditions the timing of receipts due to a calendar shift in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006 a change in customer mix and lower accounts payable and accruals due to lower volumes partially offset by lower inventory levels 

net cash used in investing activities in 2008 was 2261 million compared to 3102 million for 2007 the decrease is due to lower acquisition investments during 2008 as compared to 2007 partially offset by higher capital spending capital expenditures including 2263 million for acquisitions have totaled 7729 million over the past three years capital spending during 2009 for the company excluding acquisitions is estimated to range from 120 million to 130 million which will be used primarily to purchase equipment and maintenance capital expenditures to improve efficiency and reduce costs 

net cash used in financing activities for 2008 was 3429 million compared to 5400 million in 2007 the primary reason for the change was lower repayment of certain indebtedness of approximately 333 million due to declining business conditions and lower borrowings in 2008 as compared to repayments of approximately 534 million in 2007

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

  

index to financial statements the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

  

  

 the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets which for the company are its trademarks is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks significant 

  

index to financial statements judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates royalty rates wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 

the company reviews longlived assets including its intangible assets subject to amortization which for the company are its patents and customer relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of longlived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the company conducted interim impairment tests and recorded impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of 14189 million and 1245 million respectively 

 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 once adopted sfas 141r will impact the recognition and measurement of future business combinations and certain income tax benefits recognized from prior business combinations

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the company’s manufacturing costs distribution costs and operating expenses the carpet tile and laminate industry experienced significant inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs beginning in the first quarter of 2004 and the prices increased dramatically during the latter part of 2008 peaking in the late third and early fourth quarters for the period from 1999 through the beginning of 2004 the carpet and tile industry experienced moderate inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs in the past the company has generally been able to pass along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations however the spike in these prices during 2008 was rapid and relatively brief which will likely limit the company’s ability to fully recoup these added costs through price increases 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer in light of the current extraordinary economic climate the company believes that seasonality in 2009 may not be typical as compared to prior years as more consumers delay purchases

raw materials and suppliers 

mohawk segment 

the principal raw materials the carpet and rug business uses are nylon polypropylene polyester and wool resins and fibers synthetic backing materials latex and various dyes and chemicals major raw materials used in the company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the company obtains most of its externally purchased nylon fibers principally from two major suppliers invista inc and solutia inc although temporary disruptions of supply of carpet raw materials were experienced in 2005 the carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent years the company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of resin and fiber which are readily available 

daltile segment 

in the ceramic tile business the company manufactures tile primarily from clay talc nepheline syenite and glazes the company has entered into a longterm supply agreement for most of its talc requirements

the company buys the balance of its resin requirements from a number of companies the company believes there are ample sources of supply located within a reasonable distance of unilin’s facilities 

competition 

the principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service style quality price and to a certain extent product innovation and technology in each of the markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines in the laminate flooring market the company believes it has a competitive advantage as a result of unilin’s industry leading design and patented technologies which allows the company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish quality installation and assembly in the mohawk and daltile segments the investments in advanced manufacturing computer systems the extensive diversity of equipment as well as the company’s marketing strategy and distribution system contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price the carpet and rug industry has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years and the company is one of the largest carpet and rug manufacturers in the world while the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented the company believes it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own north american distribution system the company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring market from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 

mohawk segment 

the carpet and rug industry is highly competitive based on industry publications the top 10 north american carpet and rug manufacturers including their american and foreign divisions in 2006 had worldwide carpet and rug sales in excess of 11 billion of the over 15 billion market the company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs in terms of sales dollars in the world based on its 2006 sales 

daltile segment 

the company estimates that over 100 tile manufacturers more than half of which are based outside the us compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the us although the us ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both the manufacturing and distribution levels the company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers distributors and marketers of ceramic tile in the us and the world

 item 1a risk factors tableend certain factors affecting the company’s performance 

in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the current downturn in the us housing market has negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business and further significant or prolonged declines in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the floor covering industry in which the company participates is highly dependent on general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels availability of credit and demand for housing the company derives a majority of the company’s sales from the replacement segment of the market therefore economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity including new construction which is cyclical in nature and currently in a downturn the current downturn in the us housing market has negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the company’s business although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity these activities have also lagged during the current downturn a significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may be unable to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuelrelated costs on to its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs vary with market conditions the company’s costs for carpet raw materials and fuelrelated materials are currently higher than historical averages and may remain so indefinitely although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time the company’s profitability may be materially adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in the flooring industry which could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the company’s competitive position may 

  

require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products or force the company to lower prices any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions 

the company has typically grown its business through acquisitions growth through acquisitions involves risks many of which may continue to affect the company after the acquisition the company can not give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue profitability and production that the company expects the combination of an acquired company’s business with the company’s existing businesses involves risks the company can not be assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or incurrence of debt the company may also face challenges in consolidating functions integrating the company’s organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel these challenges may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

 the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues level of expenses and operating results 

failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations even if integration occurs successfully failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth profitability or productivity or otherwise not perform as expected may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

as part of the company’s business strategy the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities the company may not be able successfully to identify suitable acquisition candidates to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the company’s existing businesses or to manage profitably acquired businesses 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the principal raw materials used in the company’s manufacturing operations include nylon and polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers which are used primarily in the company’s carpet and rugs business talc clay nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in the company’s ceramic tile business wood paper and resins which are used primarily in the company’s laminate flooring business and other materials an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company’s operations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties 

the nature of the company’s operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico and europe could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing facilities in mexico and europe represent a significant portion of the company’s capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring respectively accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on either of these operations could have a material adverse effect on the company the business regulatory and political environments in mexico and europe differ from those in the us and the company’s mexican and european operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to the countries in which they occur particularly with respect to labor regulations which tend to be more stringent in europe and to a lesser extent mexico the company cannot assure investors that the company will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or upon the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company could face increased competition as a result of the agreements under world trade organization “wto” and the north american free trade agreement “nafta” 

the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties pursuant to agreements under the wto may have on the company’s operations although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 

although nafta eliminated tariffs imposed on the company’s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states effective january 1 2008 it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the company’s financial periods 

the results of the company’s foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into us dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for the statement of earnings accounts using the company’s weighted average rates during the period the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future although the company has not yet experienced material losses due to foreign currency fluctuation the company may not be able to manage effectively the company’s currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the company’s debt and results of operations and affect comparability of the company’s results between financial periods 

  

if the company is unable to protect the company’s intellectual property rights particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and the company’s registered trademarks the company’s business and prospects could be harmed 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the us and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic ® family of patents which protects unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the us and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

the company requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past the company has had companies claim that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that the company’s products infringe or may infringe those parties’ intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the us and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

  

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorneys fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nyse have in recent years issued new requirements and regulations most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 from time to time since the adoption of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 these authorities have continued to develop additional regulations or interpretations of existing regulations the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the company is a leading producer of floor covering products for residential and commercial applications in the us and europe with net sales in 2007 of 76 billion the company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer a leading manufacturer marketer and distributor of ceramic tile natural stone and hardwood flooring in the us and a leading producer of laminate flooring in the us and europe 

the company has three reporting segments the mohawk segment the daltile segment and the unilin segment the mohawk segment manufactures markets and distributes its product lines which include carpet rugs pad ceramic tile hardwood resilient and laminate through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using companyoperated trucks common carrier or rail transportation the segment product lines are sold through various selling channels which include floor covering retailers home centers mass merchandisers department stores independent distributors commercial dealers and commercial end users the daltile segment manufactures markets and distributes its product lines which include ceramic tile porcelain tile and stone products through its network of regional distribution centers and approximately 262 companyoperated sales service centers using companyoperated trucks common carriers or rail transportation the segment product lines are purchased by floor covering retailers home centers independent distributors tile specialty dealers tile contractors and commercial end users the unilin segment manufactures markets and distributes its product lines which include laminate flooring wood flooring insulated roofing and other woodbased panels through various selling channels which include independent retailers home centers independent distributors contractors and commercial users 

in 2006 the primary categories of the us floor covering industry were carpet and rug 62 ceramic tile 13 hardwood 11 resilient and rubber 8 and laminate 6 while the us floor covering industry has experienced softened demand in 2007 due to the downturn in the us residential housing market compound average growth rates for all flooring categories for the period from 2002 through 2006 have met or exceeded the growth rates measured in sales dollars for the real gross domestic product of the us over the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 43 for carpets and rugs 76 for ceramic tile 53 for resilient and rubber 135 for laminate and 71 for hardwood 

the company reported net earnings of 7068 million or diluted earnings per share “eps” of 1032 compared to net earnings of 4558 million and 670 eps for 2006 the increase in eps resulted primarily from a tax restructuring in one of the company’s foreign subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of approximately 245 million and a related income tax benefit of approximately 272 million in addition eps was favorably impacted by continued growth in the european and commercial channels and favorable euro exchange rates the increase was partially offset by lower sales demand in the company’s us residential new construction and replacement channels which the company believes is primarily attributable to the slowing us housing industry 

the company believes that industry demand for the products manufactured by the company will continue to be impacted by the softened demand beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continuing throughout 2007 and because of this the company anticipates continued slow us industry sales in the first quarter of 2008 that will impact margins and earnings both of our mohawk and daltile segments reflect these industry trends although the company believes both are wellpositioned for industry improvement in the longterm the company also continues to be impacted by higher raw material costs the company continues to look at ways to reduce manufacturing administration and marketing expenses based on current industry conditions and will continue to adjust as required

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

  

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

 

  

  

  

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has 

  

full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

industry 

the united states floor covering industry has grown from 124 billion in sales in 1992 to 241 billion in 2005 in 2005 the primary categories of the united states floor covering industry were carpet and rug 62 ceramic tile 13 hardwood 11 resilient and rubber 8 and laminate 6 each of these categories has been impacted by 

 

  

  

  

  

 compound average growth rates for all categories except the resilient and rubber category for the period from 2002 through 2005 have met or exceeded the growth rates measured in sales dollars for the gross domestic product of the united states over the same period ceramic tile laminate and hardwood continued to exceed the growth rate for housing starts over the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 38 for carpets and rugs 73 for ceramic tile 66 for resilient and rubber 211 for laminate and 80 for hardwood 

according to the most recent figures available from the floor covering weekly worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of american manufacturers and their domestic divisions was approximately 23 billion square yards in 2005 this volume represents a market in excess of 149 billion 

the level of sales in the overall floor covering industry is influenced by a number of factors including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy 

broadloom carpet is defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size and has two primary markets residential and commercial in 2005 the residential market made up approximately 75 of industry amounts shipped and the commercial market comprised approximately 25 an estimated 49 of industry shipments are made in response to replacement demand which usually involves exact yardage or “cut order” shipments that typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full rolls because the replacement business generally involves higher quality carpet cut to order by the manufacturer rather than the dealer this business tends to have higher margins for manufacturers than the new construction business 

the united states ceramic tile industry shipped 33 billion square feet or 31 billion in 2005 sales in the ceramic tile industry are influenced by the same factors that influence the overall floor covering industry including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy 

the ceramic tile industry’s two primary markets residential applications and commercial applications represent 705 and 282 of the industry total respectively of the total residential market 60 of the dollar values of shipments are for new construction

the manufacturing facilities for other activities in the unilin business insulated roofing and other woodbased panels are all configured for costefficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the european market 

raw materials and suppliers 

mohawk segment 

the principal raw materials the carpet and rug business uses are nylon polypropylene polyester and wool resins and fibers synthetic backing materials latex and various dyes and chemicals major raw materials used in the companys manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the company obtains most of its externally purchased nylon fibers principally from two major suppliers invista inc and solutia inc although temporary disruptions of supply of carpet raw materials were experienced in 2005 as a result of hurricanes the carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent years the company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of resin and fiber which are readily available 

daltile segment 

in the ceramic tile business the company manufactures tile primarily from clay talc nepheline syenite and glazes the company has entered into a longterm supply agreement for most of its talc requirements

unilin segment 

the principal raw materials used in producing boards and laminate flooring are wood paper and resin 

wood supply is a very fragmented market in europe the company has longstanding relationships with approximately 25 suppliers these suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species varying from fresh round wood to several kinds of byproducts of sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard production giving the company a costeffective and secure supply of raw material in the united states the company has a longterm contract with a contiguously located lumber company that supplies most of its total needs for wood 

major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business in both europe and the united states the company manufactures most of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities in europe and the united states in europe the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the company which permits greater control over the laminate flooring manufacturing process enabling the company to produce higherquality products 

the company buys the balance of its resin requirements from a number of companies the company believes there are ample sources of supply located within a reasonable distance of unilin’s facilities 

competition 

the principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service style quality price and to a certain extent product innovation and technology in each of the markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines in the laminate flooring market the company believes it has a competitive advantage as a result of unilin’s industry leading design and patented technologies which allows the company to distinguish its laminate flooring products in the areas of finish quality installation and assembly in the mohawk and daltile segments the investments in advanced manufacturing data processing the extensive diversity of equipment as well as the company’s marketing strategy and distribution system contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price the carpet and rug industry has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years and the company is one of the largest carpet and rug manufacturers in the world while the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented the company believes it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own north american distribution system the company faces competition in the laminate flooring market from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers

 item 1a risk factors 

certain factors affecting the companys performance

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels and demand for housing a prolonged decline in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the floor covering industry in which the company participates is highly dependent on general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending and interest rate levels the company derives a majority of the company’s sales from the replacement segment of the market therefore economic changes that result in a prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity including new construction which is cyclical in nature although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry the industry could experience similar downturns in the future which could have a negative impact on the company’s business 

the company may be unable to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuelrelated costs on to its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs vary with market conditions the company’s costs for carpet raw materials and fuelrelated materials are currently higher than historical averages and may remain so indefinitely although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material and fuelrelated costs to its customers the company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the company’s products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time the company’s profitability may be materially adversely affected 

  

the company faces intense competition in the industry which could decrease demand for the company’s products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the company’s product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company’s products or force the company to lower prices any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions 

the company has typically grown its business through acquisitions growth through acquisitions involves risks many of which may continue to affect the company after the acquisition the company can not give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue profitability and production that the company expects the combination of an acquired company’s business with the company’s existing businesses involves risks the company can not be assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or incurrence of debt the company may also face challenges in consolidating functions integrating the company’s organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel these challenges may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

 the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues level of expenses and operating results 

failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations even if integration occurs successfully failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth profitability or productivity or otherwise not perform as expected may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

as part of the company’s business strategy the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities the company may not be able successfully to identify suitable acquisition candidates to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the company’s existing businesses or to manage profitably acquired businesses 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the principal raw materials used in the company’s manufacturing operations include nylon and polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers which are used primarily in the company’s carpet and rugs business talc 

  

clay nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in the company’s ceramic tile business wood paper and resins which are used primarily in the company’s laminate flooring business and other materials an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company’s operations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the company’s operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties 

the nature of the company’s operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico and europe could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing facilities in mexico and europe represent a significant portion of the company’s capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring respectively in addition as a result of the unilin acquisition the company now has more significant general operations abroad particularly in europe accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on either operation could have a material adverse effect on the company the business regulatory and political environments in mexico and in europe differ from those in the united states and the company’s mexican and european operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to the countries in which they occur particularly with respect to labor regulations which tend to be more stringent in europe and to a lesser extent mexico the company cannot assure investors that the company will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or upon the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company could face increased competition as a result of the agreements under world trade organization “wto” and the north american free trade agreement “nafta” 

the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties pursuant to agreements under the wto may have on the company’s operations although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 

although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company’s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january 1 2008 it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the company’s financial periods 

the results of the company’s foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into us dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for the statement of earnings accounts using the company’s weighted average rates during the period the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do 

  

so in the future although the company has not yet experienced material losses due to foreign currency fluctuation the company may not be able to manage effectively the company’s currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the company’s debt and results of operations and affect comparability of the company’s results between financial periods 

if the company is unable to protect the company’s intellectual property rights particularly with respect to the company’s patented laminate flooring technology and the company’s registered trademarks the company’s business and prospects could be harmed 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the company’s businesses particularly the company’s laminate flooring business depend in part upon the company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the company’s principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the united states and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the company’s employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic ® family of patents which protects unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the company’s pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the company’s filings could render the company’s intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the company’s efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the company’s technology without the company’s authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the company’s patents the use of the company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause the company to lose sales or otherwise harm the company’s business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the company’s intellectual property the company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit the company’s ability to protect the company’s trademarks and impede the company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

the company requires third parties with access to the company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the company’s trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the company’s growth and future revenue 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the company’s products 

in the past the company has had companies claim that certain technologies incorporated in the company’s products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the 

  

future from parties asserting that the company’s products infringe or may infringe those parties’ intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the company’s products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the company’s proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company’s technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the company’s favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorneys fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance 

the company’s stock is publicly traded as a result the company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nyse have in recent years issued new requirements and regulations most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 from time to time since the adoption of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 these authorities have continued to develop additional regulations or interpretations of existing regulations the company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

forwardlooking information 

certain of the statements in this annual report on form 10k particularly those anticipating future performance business prospects growth and operating strategies proposed acquisitions and similar matters and those that include the words “believes” “anticipates” “forecast” “estimates” or similar expressions constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended for those statements mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions which involve risks and uncertainties the following important factors could cause future results to differ changes in industry conditions competition raw material prices energy costs timing and level of capital expenditures integration of acquisitions introduction of new products rationalization of operations litigation and other risks identified in mohawks sec reports and public announcements

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2006 versus 2005 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

  gross profit was 22313 million 282 of net sales for 2006 and 17682 million 267 of net sales for 2005 gross profit as a percentage of net sales was favorably impacted by the unilin acquisition selling price increases internal growth and acquisitions within the daltile segment the increase was offset by increased raw material distribution and start up costs when compared to 2005 in addition the 2005 gross margin was impacted 

  

by a nonrecurring 343 million 223 million net of taxes fair value adjustment applied to unilin’s acquired inventory 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 were 13923 million 176 of net sales compared to 10959 million 166 of net sales for 2005 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to amortization of intangibles and the expensing of stock options which was not required in 2005 during the current year when compared to 2005

interest expense for 2006 was 1737 million compared to 668 million in 2005 the increase in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was attributable to higher average debt levels as a result of the unilin acquisition in addition interest rates in 2006 were higher when compared to 2005 

income tax expense was 2205 million or 326 of earnings before income taxes for 2006 compared to 2150 million or 357 of earnings before income taxes for 2005 the decrease in the tax rate is due to the combination of domestic and international tax rates resulting from the unilin acquisition when compared to 2005

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2005 versus 2004 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

  gross profit was 17682 million 267 of net sales for 2005 and 16242 million 276 of net sales for 2004 the reduction in percentage was primarily attributable to increased raw material costs energy costs transportation costs a nonrecurring 343 million 223 million net of taxes fair value adjustment applied to unilin’s acquired inventory and higher import costs 

operating income for 2005 was 6724 million 102 of net sales compared to 6390 million 109 of net sales in 2004 operating income attributable to the mohawk segment was 4268 million 90 of segment net sales in 2005 compared to 4277 million 98 of segment net sales in 2004 the percentage decrease in operating income was attributable to the higher raw material costs energy costs and transportation costs operating income attributable to the daltile segment was 2602 million 150 of segment net sales in 2005 compared to 2198 million 145 of segment net sales in 2004 the increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to product mix shift and implementing increased pricing to help offset increased raw material energy transportation and higher import costs 

interest expense for 2005 was 668 million compared to 534 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense was attributable to the debt raised to fund the unilin acquisition 

income tax expense was 2150 million or 357 of earnings before income taxes for 2005 compared to 2100 million or 362 of earnings before income taxes for 2004 the improved rate was primarily attributable to the utilization of tax credits and the onetime effect of state tax law changes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys primary capital requirements are for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the company’s capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds bank credit lines term and senior notes the sale of trade receivables and credit terms from suppliers 

cash flows generated by operations for 2006 were 7820 million compared to 5615 million for 2005 contributing to the improved cash flow was higher net earnings after adjusting for the incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the unilin acquisition and improved working capital compared to the prior year 

net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was 2367 million compared to 28608 million for 2005 the change was primarily attributable to the unilin acquisition in 2005 and lower capital expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005 capital expenditures including 27 billion for acquisitions have totaled 32 billion over the past three years capital spending during 2007 for the mohawk daltile and unilin segments combined excluding acquisitions is expected to range from 250 million to 300 million which includes approximately 100 million for strategic capacity expansions and the remaining capital expenditures will be used primarily to purchase equipment and to add manufacturing and distribution capacity the company will assess the need to make the capacity expansion additions during the year based on economic and industry conditions 

  

net cash used in financing activities for 2006 was 6208 million compared to cash provided in 2005 of 24407 million the primary reason for the change was an increase in debt payments during 2006 compared to the same period in 2005

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company with respect to its mohawk and daltile segments its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season the unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter the third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the european holiday in late summer

industry 

the united states floor covering industry has grown from 124 billion in sales in 1992 to 228 billion in 2004 in 2004 the primary categories of the united states floor covering industry were carpet and rug 62 ceramic tile 13 hardwood 10 resilient and rubber 9 and laminate 6 each of these categories has been positively impacted by 

• increases in average selling price per square foot 

• increases in the residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets 

• growth in housing starts and housing resales 

• increases in average house size and 

• increases in home ownership 

compound average growth rates for all categories except the resilient and rubber category for the period from 1999 through 2004 have met or exceeded the growth rates measured in sales dollars for the gross domestic product of the united states over the same period ceramic tile laminate and hardwood continued to exceed the growth rate for housing starts over the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 30 for carpets and rugs 70 for ceramic tile 06 for resilient and rubber 174 for laminate and 94 for hardwood 

according to the most recent figures available from the united states department of commerce worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of american manufacturers and their domestic divisions was approximately 23 billion square yards in 2004 this volume represents a market in excess of 14 billion the overall level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by a number of factors including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy 

broadloom carpet defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size has two primary markets residential and commercial with the residential market making up approximately 76 of industry amounts shipped in 2004 and the commercial market comprising approximately 24 an estimated 49 of industry shipments are made in response to replacement demand which usually involves exact yardage or cut order shipments that typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full rolls because the replacement business generally involves higher quality carpet cut to order by the manufacturer rather than the dealer this business tends to be more profitable for manufacturers than the new construction business 

the united states ceramic tile industry shipped 31 billion square feet or 29 billion in 2004 sales in the ceramic tile industry are influenced by the same factors that influence the carpet industry including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy 

the ceramic tile industrys two primary markets residential applications and commercial applications represent 698 and 288 of the industry total respectively of the total residential market 61 of the dollar values of shipments are for new construction

the manufacturing facilities for other activities in the unilin business insulated roofing and other woodbased panels are all configured for costefficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the european market 

raw materials and suppliers 

  mohawk segment 

  the principal raw materials the carpet and rug business uses are nylon polypropylene polyester and wool resins and fibers synthetic backing materials latex and various dyes and chemicals major raw materials used in the companys manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the company obtains all of its externally purchased nylon fibers principally from two major suppliers invista inc and solutia inc although temporary disruptions of supply of carpet raw materials have been experienced as a result of recent hurricanes the carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent years the company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of resin and fiber which are readily available 

  daltile segment 

in the ceramic tile business the company manufactures tile primarily from clay talc nepheline syenite and glazes the company has entered into a longterm supply agreement for most of its talc requirements 

the company owns longterm clay mining rights in alabama kentucky and mississippi that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry tile the company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its nonquarry tile the company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a number of independent sources 

the company has two suppliers for its nepheline syenite requirements if these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements the company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available 

glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tile glazes consist of frit ground glass zircon stains and other materials with frit being the largest ingredient the company manufactures approximately 45 of its frit requirements 

unilin segment 

the principal raw materials used in producing boards and laminate flooring are wood paper and resin 

wood supply is a very fragmented market in europe the company has longstanding relationships with approximately 25 suppliers these suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species varying from fresh round wood to several kinds of byproducts of sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard production giving the company a costeffective and secure supply of raw material 

 

in the united states the company has a longterm contract with a strategic partner that supplies approximately 90 of its total needs for wood on a vendormanaged inventory program 

major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business in both europe and the united states the company does more than 90 of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities in europe and the united states in europe the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the company which permits greater control over the laminate flooring manufacturing process enabling the company to produce higherquality products

competition 

the principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service style quality price and to a certain extent product innovation and technology in each of the markets other than laminate flooring price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines in the laminate flooring market the company believes it has a competitive advantage as a result of unilins highend products and patented technologies which allows the company to distinguish its laminate flooring products in the areas of finish quality installation and assembly in the mohawk and daltile segments the recent investments in modernized advanced manufacturing and data processing equipment the extensive diversity of equipment that has been invested as well as the companys marketing strategy and distribution system contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price the carpet and rug industry has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years and the company is one of the largest carpet and rug manufacturers in the world while the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented the company believes it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own north american distribution system the laminate flooring industry has a number of significant competitors more than either the carpet and rug industry or the ceramic tile industry the company faces competition in the laminate flooring market from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers

 item 1a risk factors 

  certain factors affecting the companys performance 

in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels and demand for housing a prolonged decline in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the floor covering industry in which the company participates is highly dependent on general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending and interest rate levels the company derives a majority of the companys sales from the replacement segment of the market therefore economic changes that result in a prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity including new construction which is cyclical in nature although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

the construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry the industry could experience similar downturns in the future which could have a negative impact on the companys business 

the company may be unable to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuelrelated costs on to its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the companys profitability 

the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs vary with market conditions as a result of recent hurricanes and other general economic factors the companys costs of carpet raw materials and fuelrelated costs are currently higher than historical averages and may remain so indefinitely although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and fuelrelated costs to its customers the companys ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for the companys products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time the companys profitability may be materially adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in the industry which could decrease demand for the companys products or force it to lower prices which could have a material adverse effect on the companys profitability 

the floor covering industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of the companys competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the companys competitive position may require substantial investments in the companys product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the companys products or force the company to lower prices any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the company may not be able to successfully integrate unilin or other acquisitions that the company may make in the future 

the process of combining the businesses of unilin with the companys existing businesses involves risks the company will face challenges in consolidating functions integrating the companys organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel these challenges will result principally because the two companies currently 

maintain executive offices in different locations 

manufacture and sell different types of products through different distribution channels 

conduct business from various locations 

maintain different operating systems and software on different computer hardware and 

have different employment and compensation arrangements for their employees 

 

in addition the majority of unilins operating facilities are located in europe where the company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility as a result the integration will be complex and will require additional attention from members of management the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues level of expenses and operating results the company may face similar challenges in combining the companys businesses with any other businesses that the company acquires in the future 

failure to successfully manage and integrate unilin with the companys existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect the companys financial condition and results of operations even if integration occurs successfully failure of the unilin acquisition or any future acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth profitability or productivity or otherwise not perform as expected may adversely impact the companys financial condition and results of operations the company has incurred and will continue to incur certain liabilities and expenses in connection with the unilin acquisition or any future acquisitions 

the company has not yet completed the testing of the adequacy of unilins internal control over financial reporting and it is possible that the companys testing or that of the companys independent auditors in connection with the audit of the companys financial results for the year ended december 31 2006 will reveal material weaknesses in unilins internal control over financial reporting 

as part of the integration of unilin the company is in the process of documenting and testing of the unilins internal control over financial reporting to allow management and the companys independent registered public accounting firm to report in 2006 on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as it pertains to unilins operations the adequacy of unilins internal control over financial reporting has not previously been attested to by any independent accounting firm as no such attestation was required by virtue of unilins status as a foreign privatelyheld company the company anticipates completing the testing of unilins internal control over financial reporting by the end of 2006 the companys testing or the subsequent testing by the companys independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in the companys internal control over financial reporting in that event the companys management may not be able to report that the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective and the companys auditors will not be able to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

as part of the companys business strategy the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities the company may not be able successfully to identify suitable acquisition candidates to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions to complete acquisitions or to manage profitably acquired businesses 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the principal raw materials used in the companys manufacturing operations include nylon polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers and carpet backings which are used primarily in the companys carpet and rugs business talc clay nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in the companys ceramic tile business wood paper and resins which are used primarily in the companys laminate flooring business and other materials an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the companys business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the companys operations which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the companys operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties 

the nature of the companys operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico and europe could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the companys monterrey mexico manufacturing facility and the companys manufacturing facilities in europe represent a significant portion of the companys total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring respectively in addition as a result of the unilin acquisition the company now has more significant general operations abroad particularly in europe accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the companys tile operations as a whole similarly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys european operations could have a material adverse effect on the companys laminate flooring operations as a whole the business regulatory and political environments in mexico and in europe differ from those in the united states and the companys mexican and european operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to the countries in which they occur particularly with respect to labor regulations which tend to be more stringent in europe and to a lesser extent mexico the company cannot assure investors that the company will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the companys operations or upon the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north american free trade agreement nafta 

the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under gatt may have on the companys operations although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 

although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the companys ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january 1 2008 it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the companys financial periods 

the results of the companys foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into us dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for the statement of earnings accounts using the companys weighted average rates during the period the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future although the company has not yet experienced material losses due to foreign currency fluctuation the company may not be able to manage effectively the companys currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the companys debt and results of operations and affect comparability of the companys results between financial periods 

 

if the company is unable to protect the companys intellectual property rights particularly with respect to the companys patented laminate flooring technology and the companys registered trademarks the companys business and prospects could be harmed 

the future success and competitive position of certain of the companys businesses particularly the companys laminate flooring business depend in part upon the companys ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the companys principal product families the company relies in part on the patent trade secret and trademark laws of the united states and countries in europe as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the companys employees to protect that technology 

the company has obtained a number of patents relating to the companys products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents including the uniclic ® family of patents which protects unilins interlocking laminate flooring panel technology the company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the company with competitive advantages that third parties will not challenge these patents or that the companys pending patent applications will be approved in addition patent filings by third parties whether made before or after the date of the companys filings could render the companys intellectual property less valuable 

furthermore despite the companys efforts the company may be unable to prevent competitors andor third parties from using the companys technology without the companys authorization independently developing technology that is similar to that of the company or designing around the companys patents the use of the companys technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the company has developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm the companys business in addition if the company does not obtain sufficient protection for the companys intellectual property the companys competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired which would limit the companys growth and future revenue 

the company has obtained and applied for numerous us and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate the company cannot guarantee that any of the companys pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if such applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit the companys ability to protect the companys trademarks and impede the companys marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

the company requires third parties with access to the companys trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential while such measures are intended to protect the companys trade secrets there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the companys confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties in any of these circumstances the companys competitiveness could be significantly impaired which would limit the companys growth and future revenue 

companies may claim that the company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the companys products 

the company has in the past had companies claim that certain technologies incorporated in the companys products infringe their patent rights there can be no assurance that the company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that the companys products infringe or may infringe those parties intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that the companys products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or in some recent cases until 18 months following submission and the company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the companys products or processes if patents are later issued on these applications the company may be liable for infringement 

 

furthermore the company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the companys proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others likewise the company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors litigation either as plaintiff or defendant could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the companys technical and management personnel from operations whether or not such litigation is resolved in the companys favor in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation the company might be required to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and attorneys fees discontinue the use and sale of infringing products expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology there can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms if at all in the event of a successful claim against the company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology the companys business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

results of operations 

following are the results of operations for the last three years 

 year ended december 31 2005 as compared with year ended december 31 2004

 gross profit was 17231 million 260 of net sales for 2005 and 16208 million 276 of net sales for 2004 the reduction in percentage was primarily attributable to increased raw material costs energy costs transportation costs an increase in the lifo reserve requirement a nonrecurring fair value adjustment applied to unilins acquired inventory and higher import costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2005 were 10959 million 166 of net sales compared to 9853 million 168 of net sales for 2004 the reduction in percentage was attributable to better leveraging of selling general and administrative expenses

interest expense for 2005 was 668 million compared to 534 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense was attributable to the debt raised to fund the unilin acquisition 

income tax expense was 1988 million or 357 of earnings before income taxes for 2005 compared to 2088 million or 362 of earnings before income taxes for 2004 the improved rate was primarily attributable to the utilization of tax credits and the onetime effect of state tax law changes

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

the companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 

accounts receivable and revenue recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectibility can be reasonably assured the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts returns claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost is determined using the lastin firstout method lifo for approximately 86 69 of total consolidated inventory of the inventory within the mohawk segment which matches current costs with current revenues and the firstin firstout method fifo which is used to value inventory within both the daltile and unilin segments and inventory not valued under the lifo method in the mohawk segment inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage which is a function of historical usage and anticipated future selling price expected sales below cost excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using estimated future cash flows these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and therefore could materially impact the companys consolidated financial statements intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives the useful life of a definitelived intangible asset is based on assumptions and judgments made by management at the time of acquisition changes in these judgments and assumptions that could include a loss of customers a change in the assessment of future operations or a prolonged economic downturn could materially change the value of the definitelived intangible assets and therefore could materially impact the companys financial statements 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the companys tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings as disclosed in the companys consolidated financial statements in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable the company consults with its internal experts the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it recent accounting pronouncements

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2004 versus 2003 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

sales in the first and fourth quarters of 2004 were impacted by a shift of four days from the fourth to the first quarter when compared to 2003 

gross profit was 16208 million 276 of net sales for 2004 and 13938 million 279 of net sales for 2003 the reduction in percentage was primarily attributable to increased raw material costs energy costs transportation costs and higher import costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2004 were 9853 million 168 of net sales compared to 8518 million 170 of net sales for 2003 the reduction in percentage was attributable to better leveraging of selling general and administrative expenses 

operating income for 2004 was 6356 million 108 of net sales compared to 5420 million 109 of net sales in 2003 operating income attributable to the mohawk segment was 4243 million 97 of segment net sales in 2004 compared to 3640 million 98 of segment net sales in 2003 the percentage decrease in operating income was attributable to the higher raw material costs energy costs and transportation costs operating income attributable to the daltile segment was 2198 million 145 of segment net sales in 2004 compared to 1872 million 148 of segment net sales in 2003 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to higher energy costs import costs and transportation costs 

interest expense for 2004 was 534 million compared to 556 million in 2003 the decrease in interest expense was attributable to larger benefit from a fair value adjustment related to an interest rate swap during 2004 when compared to 2003 

income tax expense was 2088 million or 362 of earnings before income taxes for 2004 compared to 1783 million or 365 of earnings before income taxes for 2003 the improved rate was a result of the utilization of tax credits 

year ended december 31 2003 as compared with year ended december 31 2002 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 were 49994 million reflecting an increase of 4824 million or approximately 107 over the 45170 million reported in the year ended december 31 2002 the increased net sales were attributable to the acquisition of daltile and lees carpet and internal growth the mohawk segment recorded net sales of 37308 million in 2003 compared to 36188 million in 2002 representing an increase of 1120 million or approximately 30 the growth was attributable to the lees carpet acquisition and internal growth of product lines the daltile segment recorded net sales of 12685 million in 2003 reflecting an increase of 3704 million or 412 over the 8982 million reported in the year ended december 31 2002 the daltile results are not included in the companys consolidated financial statements prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition however when the daltile net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 are compared to the daltile pro forma net sales of 11342 million for the year ended december 31 2002 derived by combining daltile net sales of 2360 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition date after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile net sales of 8982 million for the period ending december 31 2002 an increase of approximately 118 for the period was realized the growth was primarily attributable to growth within residential products the company believes this pro forma net sales information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results of the two periods 

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2003 versus 2002 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

gross profit was 13938 million 279 of net sales for 2003 and 12691 million 281 of net sales for 2002 the reduction in percentage was primarily attributable to a change in the selling mix increased raw material costs higher energy costs higher import costs and start up costs related to the new daltile manufacturing facility 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 were 8518 million 170 of net sales compared to 7470 million 165 of net sales for 2002 the increased percentage was primarily attributable to the acquisition of daltile which has higher selling general and administrative expenses than the mohawk segment 

operating income for 2003 was 5420 million 108 of net sales compared to 5221 million 116 of net sales in 2002 operating income attributable to the mohawk segment was 3640 million 98 of segment net sales in 2003 compared to 3909 million 108 of segment net sales in 2002 the percentage decrease in operating income was attributable to the higher raw material and energy costs and a change in the selling mix operating income attributable to the daltile segment was 1872 million 148 of segment net sales in 2003 compared to 1399 million 156 of segment net sales in 2002 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to a change in product mix higher import prices and start up costs of a new manufacturing facility on a pro forma combined basis the daltile segment operating income was 1717 million 151 of pro forma segment net sales for 2002 derived by combining daltile operating income of 318 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile operating income of 1399 million for the period ended december 31 2002 the company believes that presentation of this pro forma combined operating income information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results between the two periods 

interest expense for 2003 was 556 million compared to 690 million in 2002 the decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average debt levels during 2003 when compared to 2002 offset by an increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed and variable rate debt in 2003 when compared to 2002 additionally interest expense for 2002 included 107 million related to the writeoff of an interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge 

income tax expense was 1783 million or 365 of earnings before income taxes for 2003 compared to 1591 million or 359 of earnings before income taxes for 2002 the change in tax rate resulted from the use of fewer available tax credits in 2003 when compared to 2002

net cash used in investing activities in 2004 was 1216 million compared to 4988 million for 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures and lower expenditures related to acquisitions capital expenditures were incurred primarily to modernize add and expand manufacturing and distribution facilities and equipment capital expenditures including 11168 million for acquisitions have totaled 14500 million over the past three years capital spending during 2005 for both the mohawk and daltile segments combined excluding acquisitions is expected to range from 230 million to 270 million and will be used primarily to purchase equipment and to add manufacturing capacity 

net cash used in financing activities for 2004 was 1212 million compared to cash provided in 2003 of 1894 million the primary reason for the change was a reduction in debt levels in 2004 when compared to 2003

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 

certain factors affecting the companys performance 

in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as consumer confidence and income corporate and government spending interest rate levels and demand for housing a prolonged decline in construction activity or spending for replacement floor covering products could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the us floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity including new construction remodeling and replacement which are cyclical in nature although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business additionally economic changes that result in a prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry the industry could experience similar downturns in the future which could have a negative impact on the companys business 

the company faces intense competition in its industry which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

the industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital maintaining the companys competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

as part of its business strategy the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions complete acquisitions or profitably manage acquired businesses 

acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may involve a number of special risks including among others an inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management resources 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the principal raw materials used in the companys manufacturing operations include nylon polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers and carpet backings which are used exclusively in its carpet and rugs business talc clay nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business and other materials the company has a single source supplier for all of its nepheline syenite requirements an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the companys business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the companys operations which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

the prices of raw materials and natural gas vary with market conditions although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers the companys ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for its products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys profitability 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the companys operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties 

the nature of the companys operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the companys monterrey mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the companys total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole the business regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states and the companys mexican operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to mexico 

the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north american free trade agreement nafta 

the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under gatt may have on its operations although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 

although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the companys ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january 1 2008 it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico

industry 

the floorcovering industry has grown from 124 billion in sales in 1992 to 203 billion in 2002 in 2002 the primary categories of the united states floorcovering industry were carpet and rugs 65 ceramic tile 12 vinyl and rubber 10 hardwood 9 and laminate 4 each of these categories has been positively impacted by 

us population growth requiring new and renovated housing and commercial space increasing average house size and growth in housing starts and housing resales compound average growth rates for units sold measured by square yards for each of the floorcovering categories above for the period from 1992 through 2002 with the exception of the vinyl and rubber category have met or exceeded the growth rate for both the gross domestic product of the united states and housing starts over the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 36 for carpet and rugs 103 for ceramic tile 13 for vinyl and rubber and 80 for hardwood laminate which is a relatively new product experienced a compound average growth rate of 415 from 1996 through 2002 

according to the most recent figures available from the united states department of commerce worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of american manufacturers and their domestic divisions was 19 billion square yards in 2002 this volume represents a market in excess of approximately 12 billion the overall level of sales in the carpet industry is influenced by a number of factors including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy

the principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic tile industries are price style quality and service in each of the companys markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines the companys recent investments in modernized advanced manufacturing and data processing equipment the extensive diversity of equipment in which the company has invested its marketing strategy and its distribution system contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price 

in each of the companys carpet and rug and ceramic tile businesses the company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products some of the companys existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the companys competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the companys products and in the loss of market share in addition the company faces and will continue to face pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors as well as from large customers as a result of any of these factors there could be a material adverse effect on the companys sales and profitability

critical accounting policies 

the companys discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

the company makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect various matters including 

reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and 13 

reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the companys consolidated statements of earnings during the reporting periods these estimates involve judgments with respect to among other things future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond managements control as a result actual amounts could differ from these estimates the sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes are most critical the sec defines these critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and could represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec the company discusses its significant accounting policies including those that do not require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

results of operations

during 2003 specifically the first half of 2003 the company and industry performance as a whole was impacted negatively by the overall weak conditions in the us economy and cautious consumer and commercial spending the company believes that the residential replacement business is recovering in response to improved economic conditions the company believes that the commercial business is also beginning to show signs of improvement at certain price points and anticipates the higher end business will improve later in 2004 the company is implementing a price increase in both the mohawk and daltile segment during the first quarter of 2004 to compensate for increased raw material prices resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices and higher import prices 

year ended december 31 2003 as compared with year ended december 31 2002 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 were 50051 million reflecting an increase of 4827 million or approximately 107 over the 45223 million reported in the year ended december 31 2002 the increased net sales were attributable to the acquisition of daltile and lees carpet and internal growth the mohawk segment recorded net sales of 37365 million in 2003 compared to 36242 million in 2002 representing an increase of 1124 million or approximately 31 the growth was attributable to the lees carpet acquisition and internal growth of product lines the daltile segment recorded net sales of 12685 million in 2003 reflecting an increase of 3704 million or 412 over the 8982 million reported in the year ended december 31 2002 the daltile results are not included in the companys consolidated financial statements prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition however when the daltile net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 are compared to the daltile pro forma net sales of 11342 million for the year ended december 31 2002 derived by combining daltile net sales of 2360 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition date after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile net sales of 8982 million for the period ending december 31 2002 an increase of approximately 118 for the period was realized the growth was primarily attributable to growth within residential products the company believes this pro forma net sales information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results of the two periods 

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2003 versus 2002 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

gross profit was 13594 million 272 of net sales for 2003 and 12401 million 274 of net sales for 2002 the reduction in percentage was primarily attributable to a change in the selling mix increased raw material prices resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices higher import prices and start up costs related to the new daltile manufacturing facility 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 were 8173 million 163 of net sales compared to 7180 million 159 of net sales for 2002 the increased percentage was primarily attributable to the acquisition of daltile which has higher selling general and administrative expenses 

operating income for 2003 was 5420 million 109 of net sales compared to 5221 million 115 of net sales in 2002 operating income attributable to the mohawk segment was 3640 million 97 of segment net sales in 2003 compared to 3909 million 108 of segment net sales in 2002 the percentage decrease in operating income was attributable to the higher costs associated with oil and natural gas prices and a change in the selling mix operating income attributable to the daltile segment was 1872 million 148 of segment net sales in 2003 compared to 1399 million 156 of segment net sales in 2002 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to a change in product mix higher import prices and start up costs of a new manufacturing facility on a pro forma combined basis the daltile segment operating income was 1717 million 151 of pro forma segment net sales for 2002 derived by combining daltile operating income of 318 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile operating income of 1399 million for the period ended december 31 2002 the company believes that presentation of this pro forma combined operating income information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results between the two periods 

interest expense for 2003 was 556 million compared to 690 million in 2002 the decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average debt levels during 2003 when compared to 2002 offset by an increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed and variable rate debt in 2003 when compared to 2002 additionally interest expense for 2002 included 107 million related to the writeoff of an interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge 

income tax expense was 1783 million or 365 of earnings before income taxes for 2003 compared to 1591 million or 359 of earnings before income taxes for 2002 the change in tax rate resulted from the use of fewer available tax credits in 2003 when compared to 2002 

year ended december 31 2002 as compared with year ended december 31 2001 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2002 were 45223 million reflecting an increase of 10764 million or approximately 312 over the 34459 million reported in the year ended december 31 2001 the increased net sales were attributable to the daltile acquisition and internal growth of the mohawk segment product lines the mohawk segment recorded net sales of 36242 million in 2002 compared to 34459 million in 2001 representing an increase of 1782 million or approximately 52 the growth was attributable to all segment product lines since the completion of the daltile acquisition the daltile segment recorded net sales of 8982 million in 2002 on a pro forma combined basis the daltile segment net sales were 11342 million derived by combining daltile net sales of 2360 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition date after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile net sales of 8982 million for the period ending december 31 2002 for 2002 this compares to daltile net sales of 10368 million 

derived from net sales prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition for 2001 resulting in an increase of approximately 94 for the period the growth was primarily attributable to growth within residential products the company believes this pro forma net sales information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results of the two periods 

quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2002 versus 2001 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

gross profit was 12401 million 274 of net sales for 2002 and 8329 million 242 of net sales for 2001 gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2002 was favorably impacted when compared to 2001 by daltiles higher gross profit percentage and improved manufacturing efficiencies within the mohawk segment 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2002 were 7180 million 159 of net sales compared to 5057 million 147 of net sales for 2001 the increased percentage was attributable to the daltile segment which has higher selling general and administrative expenses but also has higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales the mohawk and daltile including selling general and administrative costs prior to the acquisition of daltile segments selling general and administrative expenses reflected improvements over 2001 when compared to 2002 the improvements were due to better control of operating costs as net sales increased 

operating income for 2002 was 5221 million 115 of net sales compared to 3272 million 95 of net sales in 2001 operating income attributable to the mohawk segment was 3909 million 108 of segment net sales in 2002 compared to 3367 million 98 of segment net sales in 2001 operating income attributable to the daltile segment was 1399 million 156 of segment net sales in 2002 on a pro forma combined basis the daltile segment operating income was 1717 million 151 of pro forma segment net sales for 2002 derived by combining daltile operating income of 318 million prior to the march 20 2002 acquisition after reclassifications to conform to mohawks presentation with reported daltile operating income of 1399 million for the period ended december 31 2002 this compares to daltile operating income of 1546 million 149 of daltile net sales for 2001 the company believes that presentation of this pro forma combined operating income information will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results between the two periods 

interest expense for 2002 was 690 million compared to 298 million in 2001 the increase in interest expense was attributable to additional debt incurred in march 2002 to finance the acquisition of daltile the writeoff of approximately 107 million relating to an interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge and an increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt when compared to 2001 

income tax expense was 1591 million or 359 of earnings before income taxes for 2002 compared to 1028 million or 353 of earnings before income taxes for 2001

the level of accounts receivable increased from 5011 million at the beginning of 2003 to 5735 million at december 31 2003 the 724 million increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of lees carpet and internal sales growth inventories increased from 6780 million at the beginning of 2003 to 8324 million at december 31 2003 due primarily to building inventory for hard surface product categories within the mohawk and daltile segments and the acquisition of lees carpet 

the outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have not yet cleared the bank when the checks clear the bank they are funded by the revolving credit facility this policy does not impact any liquid assets on the consolidated balance sheets

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the companys manufacturing costs and operating expenses the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs in the past the company has generally passed along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the united states and mexico 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 

certain factors affecting the companys performance 

in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity including new construction as well as remodeling which are cyclical in nature a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry the industry could experience similar downturns in the future which could have a negative impact on the companys business 

the company faces intense competition in its industry which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

the industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a large number of manufacturers and independent distributors some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital maintaining the companys competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

as part of its business strategy the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions complete acquisitions or profitably manage acquired businesses 

acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may involve a number of special risks including among others an inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management resources 

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the principal raw materials used in the companys manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business talc clay nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business and other materials the company has a single source supplier for all of its nepheline syenite requirements an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the companys business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the companys operations which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

the prices of raw materials and natural gas vary with market conditions although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers the companys ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for its products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys profitability 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the companys operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations including fines and penalties 

the nature of the companys operations including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the companys monterrey mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the companys total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole the business regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states and the companys mexican operations are exposed to legal currency tax political and economic risks specific to mexico 

the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north american free trade agreement nafta 

the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under gatt may have on its operations although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 

although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the companys ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january 1 2008 it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico

industry 

the floorcovering industry has grown from 124 billion in sales in 1992 to 202 billion in 2001 in 2001 the primary categories of the united states floorcovering industry were carpet and rugs 65 ceramic tile 10 vinyl and rubber 12 hardwood 9 and laminate 4 each of these categories has been positively impacted by 

us population growth requiring new and renovated housing and commercial space increasing average house size up approximately 33 since 1980 and growth in vacation homes compound average growth rates for units sold measured by square yards for each of the floorcovering categories above for the period from 1992 through 2001 with the exception of the vinyl and rubber category have exceeded the growth rate for both the gross domestic product of the united states and housing starts over the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 45 for carpet and rugs 96 for ceramic tile 31 for vinyl and rubber and 81 for hardwood laminate which is a relatively new product experienced a compound average growth rate of 336 from 1996 through 2001 

according to the most recent figures available from the united states department of commerce worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of american manufacturers and their domestic divisions was 19 billion square yards in 2001 this volume represents a market in excess of approximately 12 billion the overall level of sales in the carpet industry is influenced by a number of factors including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy 

broadloom carpet defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size represented 78 of the amounts shipped by the industry in 2001 tufted broadloom carpet a category that refers to the manner of construction in addition to size represented 842 of the broadloom industry volume shipped in 2001 the broadloom carpet industry has two primary markets residential and commercial with the residential market making up approximately 71 of industry amounts shipped in 2001 and the commercial market comprising approximately 29 an estimated 48 of industry shipments are made in response to replacement demand which usually involves exact yardage or cut order shipments that typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full rolls because the replacement business generally involves higher quality carpet cut to order by the manufacturer rather than the dealer this business tends to be more profitable for manufacturers than the new construction business 

the united states ceramic tile industry shipped 23 billion square feet or 21 billion in 2001 the compound average growth rate of dollar shipments was 71 from 1992 through 2001 for ceramic tile sales in

the principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic tile industries are price style quality and service in each of the companys markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is relatively little perceived differentiation among competing product lines the companys recent investments in modernized advanced manufacturing and data processing equipment the extensive diversity of equipment in which the company has invested and its marketing strategy contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance quality style and service rather than just price 

in each of the companys carpet and rug and ceramic tile businesses the company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products some of the companys existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the companys competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the companys products and in the loss of market share in addition the company faces and will continue to face pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors as well as from large customers as a result of any of these factors there could be a material adverse effect on the companys sales and profitability

reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and reported amounts of expenses in the companys consolidated statements of earnings during the reporting periods these estimates involve judgments with respect to among other things future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond managements control as a result actual amounts could differ from these estimates the sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes are most critical the sec defines these critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use more significant judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and could represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec the company discusses its significant accounting policies including those that do not require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

impact of inflation 

inflation affects the companys manufacturing costs and operating expenses the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuelrelated costs in the past the company has generally passed along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the united states and mexico 

seasonality 

the company is a calendar yearend company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 

certain factors affecting the companys performance 

in addition to the other information provided in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 

if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to integrate mohawk and daltile successfully by managing the challenges of that integration may result in the company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the merger 

the company faces challenges in consolidating functions integrating its organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel 

these challenges will result principally because the two companies currently 

maintain executive offices in different locations manufacture and sell different types of products through different distribution channels conduct their businesses from various locations and have different employment and compensation arrangements for their employees in addition daltile has a significant manufacturing operation in mexico and the company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility outside of the united states as a result the integration will be complex and will require additional attention from members of management the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues level of expenses and operating results 

the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity including new construction as well as remodeling new construction activity and remodeling to a lesser degree are cyclical in nature and a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations construction activity is significantly affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond the companys control including 

national and local economic conditions interest rates housing demand employment levels changes in disposable income financing availability commercial rental vacancy rates business expenditures federal and state income tax policies and consumer confidence the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry including suppliers of floorcoverings the industry could experience similar downturns in the future which could have a negative impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces intense competition in its industry which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

the industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products some of its existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than it does maintaining the companys competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products and in the loss of market share in addition the company faces and will continue to face pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors as well as from large customers as a result of any of these factors there could be a material adverse effect on the companys sales and profitability 

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

as part of its business strategy the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities it may not be able to 

successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions complete acquisitions or profitably manage acquired businesses acquired operations may not achieve levels of sales operating income or productivity comparable to those of its existing operations or otherwise perform as expected acquisitions may also involve a number of special risks some or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition including among others 

the companys inability to integrate operations systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and excess costs effectively 23 

diversion of managements attention and resources and difficulty retaining and training acquired key personnel the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the companys business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers the principal raw materials used in its manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business talc clay impure nepheline syenite pure nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business and other materials the company has a single source supplier for all of its impure nepheline syenite and pure nepheline syenite requirements an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the companys business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the companys operations which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

significant increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas used in the manufacture of the companys products could have a material adverse effect on its operating margins and its business financial condition and results of operations the company purchases nylon fiber polypropylene resin talc clay impure nepheline syenite pure nepheline syenite frit zircon stains and other materials from third party suppliers the cost of some of these materials like nylon and polypropylene resin is related to oil prices the company also purchases significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in some of its production processes the prices of these raw materials and of natural gas vary with market conditions although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers the companys ability to do so is to a large extent dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market conditions for its products there have been in the past and may be in the future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered during such periods of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys profitability 

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be significant 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts new or additional requirements could be imposed and the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations 

the nature of the companys operations and previous operations by others at real property currently or formerly owned or operated by the company and the disposal of waste at third party sites exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims the company has been and will continue to be subject to these claims 

the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions changes in environmental health and safety laws and regulations enforcement of existing or new requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to expenditures and liabilities including fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results or financial condition 

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

the companys monterrey mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the companys total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole the 

business regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states and the companys mexican operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks including 

changes in international trade laws such as the north american free trade agreement or nafta affecting the companys import and export activities in mexico changes in mexican labor laws and regulations affecting the companys ability to hire and retain employees in mexico currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency potentially adverse tax consequences local laws concerning repatriation of profits political conditions in mexico unexpected changes in the regulatory environment in mexico and changes in general economic conditions in mexico the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the north american free trade agreement 

the united states is party to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt under gatt the united states currently imposes import duties on ceramic tile imported from countries outside north america at no more than 12 to be reduced ratably to no less than 85 by 2004 accordingly as these duties decrease gatt may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these countries which now export or may seek to export ceramic tile to the united states the company is uncertain what effect gatt may have on its operations 

the north american free trade agreement nafta was entered into by canada mexico and the united states and over a transition period will remove most customs duties imposed on goods traded among the three countries in addition nafta will remove or limit many investment restrictions liberalize trade in services provide a specialized means for settlement of and remedies for trade disputes arising under applicable laws and will result in new laws and regulations to further these goals although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the companys ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico which could negatively affect the companys business

floorcovering industry were carpet and rugs 63 ceramic tile 11 vinyl and
rubber 14 hardwood 8 and laminate 4 each of these categories has been
positively impacted by

          commercial space

         increasing average house size up approximately 30 since 1980 and

         growth in vacation homes

compound average growth rates for units sold measured by square yards for each
of the floorcovering categories above for the period from 1992 through 2000 have
exceeded the growth rate of the gross domestic product of the united states over
the same period during this period the compound average growth rate was 44
for carpet and rugs 106 for ceramic tile 50 for vinyl and rubber and 91
for hardwood laminate which is a relatively new product experienced a
compound average growth rate of 399 from 1996 through 2000

     according to the most recent figures available from the united states
department of commerce worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of american
manufacturers and their domestic divisions was 20 billion square yards in 2000
this volume represents a market in excess of approximately 12 billion the
overall level of sales in the carpet industry is influenced by a number of
factors including consumer confidence spending for durable goods interest
rates turnover in housing the condition of the residential and commercial
construction industries and the overall strength of the economy

represented 80 of the amounts shipped by the industry in 2000 tufted broadloom

addition to size represented 835 of the broadloom industry volume shipped in
2000 the broadloom carpet industry has two primary markets residential and
commercial with the residential market making up approximately 69 of industry
amounts shipped in 2000 and the commercial market comprising approximately 31
an estimated 47 of industry shipments are made in response to replacement
demand which usually involves exact yardage or cut order shipments that
typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full rolls
because the replacement business generally involves higher quality carpet cut to
order by the manufacturer rather than the dealer this business tends to be
more profitable for manufacturers than the new construction business

     the united states ceramic tile industry shipped 23 billion square feet or
21 billion in 2000 which represents an 81 and 59 growth rate over 1999
respectively the compound average growth rate of dollar shipments was 95 from

galaxy horizon helios and karastan are positioned to sell primarily in
the mediumtohigh retail price range in the residential broadloom market and

brand name recognition among carpet dealers and retailers with the karastan
mohawk and bigelow brands having the highest consumer recognition in the
industry karastan is the leader in the exclusive highend market the

floorscapes these programs offer varying degrees of support to dealers in the
form of sales and management training merchandising systems exclusive

vice president of sales each region has responsibility for sales distribution
and inventory management in its region all of which is coordinated by the

then to retailers

     the commercial customer base is divided into several groups educational
institutions corporate office space hospitality facilities retail space and
health care facilities in addition the company produces and sells carpet for
the export market the federal government and other niche businesses different
purchase decision makers and decisionmaking processes exist for each group

     the sales distribution channels for the commercial products have been
divided into five groups based upon traditional marketing paths main street
dealer negotiated performance specified fashion specified and hospitality and
lodging

                                        6

page

     the main street channel traditionally offers lower price point carpets sold
through retail dealers under the aladdin brand and is distributed through the
residential sales force products sold into this channel are service driven and
price sensitive

     the dealernegotiated channel is serviced through the bigelow commercial
brand in this channel large commercial flooring contractors play the most
important role in product selection on negotiated project work such as leased
commercial office and retail space this channel is relationship driven and
service oriented where top performers are rewarded with a higher percentage of a
contractors discretionary business

     the performance specified channel is serviced through the mohawk
commercial and mohawk modular brands where longterm appearance retention
and durability are key buyer criteria for more demanding project environments
such as auditoriums airports schools institutional buildings and high traffic
retail outlets woven products are strategically advantaged over tufted products
in this market channel due to differentiated performance characteristics that
are more highly valued in high traffic installations

     the karastan contract and durkan commercial brands are sold into the
fashion specified channel where distinctive styling and custom product
variations are more commonly required for project work this market channel
almost entirely specified through architects and designers includes end use
installations such as higher end corporate offices law firms boutique retail
and high profile institutional projects because of the distinctive styling and
tailored pattern detail that can be achieved through the weaving process woven
styling is highly valued among the design community

     both the performance and fashion specified sales groups also solicit
business from large end user accounts that typically make product selections
centrally for their company through internal facilities managers and purchasing
agents

     the hospitality and lodging channel markets the durkan hospitality brand
that specializes in complex printed carpets commonly seen in higher end hotels
resort facilities and casinos this channel is generally specified through a
designer but ultimately sold through independent purchasing agents that
consolidate interior furnishings purchase decisions for hotel property owners
durkan hospitality has historically offered a premium print product due to an
extensive pattern offering distinguished by visually sharper and cleaner color
separation in the final product

     the company believes its ability to make woven carpet under the mohawk
commercial and karastan contract brand names in large volume for commercial
applications differentiates it from other manufacturers most of which produce
tufted carpet almost exclusively woven carpet and specifically the companys
woven interlock products sell at higher prices than tufted carpet and generally
produce higher profit margins the company believes that it is one of the
largest producers of woven carpet in the united states and that it has several
carpet weaving machines and processes that no other manufacturer has thereby
allowing it to create carpet to meet specifications that its competitors cannot
duplicate

     the machinemade rug market is currently the fastest growing product line
of the us carpet and rug industry with an annual growth rate estimated to be
approximately 5 in 2000 much of this growth has occurred at the lowtomedium
retail price ranges the distribution channels for the rug market primarily
include department stores mass merchants floorcovering stores catalog stores
home centers and furniture stores

     the companys product lines include a broad array of rugs the karastan
brand name rugs represent the higher retail price ranges with one of the most
valued brand names in the industry and are distributed through specialty stores
along with department and furniture stores these are higher quality woven wool
rugs manufactured primarily on axminster looms

     the company emphasizes the fast growing lower retail price ranges through
the mohawk home division the rugs sold are primarily woven and tufted
polypropylene area rugs tufted border rugs and decorative mats these products

raw materials and suppliers

     carpet and rugs business the principal raw materials the carpet and rug
business uses are nylon staple fibers nylon filament fibers raw wool
polypropylene filament fibers polyester staple fibers polypropylene nylon and
polyester resins and postconsumer plastics synthetic backing materials
polyurethane and latex and various dyes and chemicals the company obtains all
of its major raw materials from independent sources and all of its externally
purchased nylon fibers from four major suppliers ei du pont de nemours and
company solutia inc basf corporation and honeywell inc most of the fibers
the company uses in carpet production are treated with stainresistant
chemicals the carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages
of raw materials in recent years the company believes that the loss of any one
supplier to its carpet and rug business would not have a material effect on its
business and that an alternative supply arrangement could be made in a
relatively short period of time

     ceramic tile business in the companys ceramic tile business the company
manufactures wall tile primarily from talc and clay floor tile and glazed
mosaic tile primarily from impure nepheline syenite and clay unglazed ceramic
tile primarily from pure nepheline syenite and clay and unglazed quarry tile
from clay during the fourth quarter of 1999 daltile sold its talc mining
operation along with the related mineral rights to wold talc company inc in
conjunction with the sale daltile entered into a longterm supply agreement
for talc requirements with wold talc

     the company owns longterm clay mining rights in alabama kentucky and
mississippi that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing
unglazed quarry tile the company purchases a number of different grades of clay
for the manufacture of its nonquarry tile the company believes that there is
an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from
a number of independent sources

     the company purchases all of its impure nepheline syenite requirements from
minnesota mining and manufacturing company the company believes however that
there is an adequate supply of impure nepheline syenite which can be obtained
from other sources pure nepheline syenite is purchased from unimin corporation
which is the only major supplier of this raw material in north america if there
were a supply interruption of pure nepheline syenite feldspar could be used in
the production of mosaic tile feldspar can be purchased from a number of
sources at comparable cost to pure nepheline syenite

     glazes are used on a significant percentage of the companys manufactured
tile glazes consist of frit ground glass zircon stains and other materials

competition

     carpet and rugs business the carpet and rugs industry is highly
competitive based on industry publications the top 20 north american carpet
and rug manufacturers including their american and foreign divisions in 2000
had worldwide sales in excess of 168 billion and the top 20 manufacturers in
1990 had sales in excess of 6 billion in 2000 the top five manufacturers had
worldwide sales in excess of 118 billion with 2001 net sales of approximately
35 billion the company believes it is the second largest producer of carpet
and rugs in terms of sales volume

     ceramic tile business the company estimates that over 100 tile
manufacturers more than half of which are based outside the united states
compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the united states
although the us ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both the
manufacturing and distribution levels the company believes it is the largest
manufacturer distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the united states and
one of the largest in the world

                                       10

page

     the principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic
tile industries are price style quality and service in each of the companys
markets price competition and market coverage are particularly important
because there is relatively little perceived differentiation among competing
product lines the companys recent investments in modernized advanced
manufacturing and data processing equipment the extensive diversity of
equipment in which the company has invested and its marketing strategy
contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance
quality style and service rather than just price

     in each of the companys carpet and rug and ceramic tile businesses the
company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign
manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products some of
the companys existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater
resources and access to capital than the company does maintaining the companys
competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its
product development efforts manufacturing facilities distribution network and
sales and marketing activities competitive pressures may also result in
decreased demand for the companys products and in the loss of market share in
addition the company faces and will continue to face pressure on sales prices
of its products from competitors as well as from large customers as a result
of any of these factors there could be a material adverse effect on the
companys sales and profitability

     the company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the
marketing of its products including aladdin american oleanr alexander

throughout the industry the company generally permits its customers to return
broadloom carpet and ceramic tile purchased from it within 30 days from the date
of sale if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product this
return policy is consistent with the companys emphasis on quality style and
performance and promotes customer satisfaction without generating enough returns
to affect materially its operating results or financial position

     during 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of mohawks
total net sales the company believes the loss of one or a few major customers
would not have a material adverse effect on its business

environmental matters

     the company is subject to various federal state local and foreign
environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing
air emissions wastewater discharges the use storage treatment and disposal
of solid and hazardous materials and the cleanup of contamination associated
therewith because of the nature of the companys business the company has
incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with such
laws and regulations the company is involved in various proceedings relating to
environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental investigation
remediation and postclosure care programs at certain sites the company has
provided reserves for such activities that it has determined to be both probable
and reasonably estimable the company does not expect that the ultimate
liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on
it

     two sites near mohawks dallas facility in its daltile division are
involved in resource conservation and recovery act rcra part b postclosure
care cleanup projects proceeding under the oversight of the texas natural
resource conservation commission tnrcc in 1991 daltile and the
predecessor to the tnrcc agreed to an administrative order the 1991 order
relating principally to the disposal by daltile of waste materials containing
lead compounds in a gravel pit elam near the city of mesquites landfill in
dallas county and at a daltileoperated landfill located on pleasant run road
pleasant run in dallas county daltiles closure plans for elam and
pleasant run were approved by the tnrcc and remediation and other activities
associated with the closures implemented the tnrcc issued postclosure care
permits for elam and pleasant run in 2000 the company expects to incur future
costs in connection with postclosure at elam and pleasant run the company
believes that any such amounts will not have a material adverse effect on it

     in october 1994 daltile masterhalco inc masterhalco a
manufacturing company not affiliated with daltile certain third party
individuals and the tnrcc agreed to an administrative order the 1994 order
relating to among other things investigation and remediation in connection
with the alleged disposal of waste materials containing lead compounds at a
gravel pit on kleburg road walton in dallas pursuant to the 1994 order
among other things an administrative penalty of 213200 was deferred pending
timely and satisfactory completion of the requirements in the 1994 order
daltile has completed certain required remediation and closure activities and
in 2000 submitted a closure certification report to the tnrcc for approval
approval of the closure certification report was received in june 2001 the
tnrcc has informed the company that a formal post closure care permit is not
required the company is now performing post closure activities of the walton
site and expects to incur future costs in connection with this activity the
company believes that any such amounts will not have a material adverse effect
on it

     daltile has reported that the texas environmental proceedings described
above followed a related criminal investigation which led to the indictments
and in 1993 the convictions of a former owner and a former officer of daltile
on federal charges of violating environmental laws and that the us attorneys
office for the northern district of texas which obtained the indictments
informed daltile on april 22 1992 that based on information in their
possession it had decided not to prosecute daltile for violations of
environmental criminal statutes

     daltile has been named as a potentially responsible party under the
federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
cercla and similar state statutes with respect to the disposal of certain
hazardous substances at various other sites in the united states including
without limitation the salford quarry superfund site and the north penn 6
superfund site based on currently available information the company believes
that the ultimate allocation of costs associated with the investigation and
remediation of these pending sites will not in the aggregate have a material
adverse effect on it

     numerous aspects of the companys manufacturing operations require
expenditures for environmental compliance for example the manufacture of
carpet and tile require expenditures for compliance with laws and regulations
governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the generation of solid and
hazardous waste many of these manufacturing processes also require expenditures
in order to comply with occupational safety and health administration osha
regulations with respect to potential employee exposure including operations
that result in the accumulation of dust that contains silica expenditures
required for compliance activities associated with environmental and osha
compliance have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect
on the company

                                       14

page

     in addition in light of the lengthy manufacturing history of the companys
facilities it is possible that additional environmental issues and related
matters may arise relating to past activities which the company cannot now
reliably predict including tort liability and liability under environmental
laws for example a number of the companys facilities in the daltile division
located in the united states used lead compounds in glaze materials the
companys mexican facilities continue to use lead compounds in their glaze
materials on certain specially ordered tiles significant exposure to lead
compounds may have adverse health effects although it is impossible to quantify
the companys liability if any in respect of these matters including
liability to individuals exposed to lead compounds no claims relating to use of
lead compounds or waste disposal matters are pending against it except as set
forth above in addition the company cannot now reliably predict the effect
which future environmental regulation in the united states mexico and canada
could have on it

     as a result of a voluntary audit the air operating permits for three of
mohawks facilities in its daltile division located in texas are in the process
of being modified and voluntary compliance agreements with the tnrcc have been
entered into in conjunction with this activity it was determined that air
pollution control equipment will be required for certain emission sources at the
dallas and el paso facilities further in november 2001 the tnrcc issued a
notice of violation nov to the el paso facility alleging failure to install
air pollution control equipment during a recent expansion the nov will be
addressed as part of the permit modification process for the el paso facility
the company believes the expenditures associated with obtaining the permit
modifications in texas including installation of the air pollution control
equipment will not have a material adverse effect on it

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

general

     during the threeyear period ended december 31 2001 the company continued
to experience growth both internally and through acquisitions

     on january 29 1999 the company acquired certain assets of image for
approximately 192 million including acquisition costs and the assumption of
30 million of taxexempt debt and on march 9 1999 the company acquired all
of the outstanding capital stock of durkan for approximately 31 million shares
of the companys common stock valued at 1165 million based on the closing
stock price the day the letter of intent was executed the image acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the durkan
acquisition was accounted for using the poolingofinterests method of
accounting

     on november 14 2000 the company acquired certain assets of crown crafts
under the agreement the company paid approximately 37 million in cash for
substantially all of the fixed assets and inventory of the division the
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

     on march 20 2002 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of daltile international inc daltile for a purchase price of
approximately 1545 million consisting of approximately 129 million shares of
the companys common stock options to purchase approximately 21 million shares
of the companys common stock and 720 million in cash the companys common
stock and options were valued at 825 million based on the measurement date
stock price the transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting

     these acquisitions have created opportunities to enhance the companys
operations by i broadening price points ii increasing vertical integration
efforts iii expanding distribution capabilities and iv facilitating entry
into niche businesses such as rugs decorative throws bedspreads coverlets
and ceramic tile

     effective november 1 2000 the company entered into an agreement with
congoleum corporation inc to become a national distributor of their vinyl
products this agreement gave the company access to a complete line of soft and
hard floorcovering products to supply to customers throughout the united
states

     the primary categories of the floorcovering industry include carpet and
rugs 63 ceramic tile 11 vinyl and rubber 14 hardwood 8 and
laminate 4 compound average growth rates in units measured in square yards
for each of these categories for the period from 1992 through 2000 have exceeded
gross domestic product of the united states over the same period during this
period the compound average growth rate was 44 for carpet and rugs 106 for
ceramic tile 50 for vinyl and rubber and 91 for hardwood laminate which
is a relatively new product experienced a compound average growth rate of 399
from 1996 through 2000 although beginning from a smaller base the growth rates
for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer preference for these
products for certain applications in response to this increasing demand the
company has increased its distribution of hard surface products including
ceramic tile vinyl hardwood and laminate the acquisition of daltile provides
a unique opportunity to help the company achieve its strategic goal of becoming
one of the worlds leading floorcovering manufacturers and distributors

     the company considers its most critical accounting policies to include its
accounts receivable and revenue recognition inventories and income tax policies
because they are most important to the companys financial condition and results
of operations and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments revenues
are recognized when goods are shipped which is when the legal title passes to
the customer the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts
returns claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims
experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value
cost is determined using the lastin firstout lifo method which matches
current costs with current revenues for substantially all inventories and the
firstin firstout fifo method for the remaining inventories income taxes
are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the

     gross profit was 8228 million 242 of net sales for 2000 and 7769
million 242 of net sales for 1999 gross profit dollars for 2000 were

more attractive return on investment of the companys resources than other
investment alternatives the company may repurchase stock from time to time when
conditions and circumstances warrant since the inception of the program a
total of approximately 90 million shares have been repurchased at an aggregate
cost of approximately 2008 million all repurchases have been financed through
the companys operations and revolving line of credit

were approximately 1224 million the company has currently addressed these
financing needs using a combination of approximately i 600 million of the
bridge credit facility ii 194 million of its revolving credit facility
iii 205 million of its onbalance sheet asset financing securitization iv
75 million of an onbalance sheet receivables securitization facility of
daltile and v 150 million of the companys existing industrial revenue
bonds term notes and senior notes approximately 223 million of the companys
revolving credit facility and 44 million of various shortterm uncommitted
credit lines remain unused immediately after closing the merger the company
intends to replace daltiles existing 75 million receivables securitization
facility with a new 100 million receivables securitization facility through a
multiselling conduit in addition the company intends to refinance the bridge
credit facility prior to the twelfth business day following the closing of the
merger a failure to repay the bridge credit facility within such 12 business
day period will subject the company to an additional fee of 35 million under
the bridge credit facility

     the company has evaluated its existing goodwill that was acquired in prior
purchase business combinations for impairment and has concluded that no
adjustment to the companys consolidated financial statements is required

     in april 2001 the eitf reached consensus on issue no 0025 vendor income
statement characterization of consideration to a purchaser of the vendors
products or services this issuance provides guidance primarily on income
statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a purchaser of the
vendors products generally cash consideration is to be classified as a
reduction of revenue unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or
services that the vendor may receive in return for this consideration the
company believes that its current accounting policies are in conformity with
eitf 0025 and does not believe that eitf 0025 will have a material effect on
the companys consolidated financial statements

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 143

the methods used by the company to measure impairment losses on longlived
assets but may result in more matters being reported as discontinued operations
than was permitted under the previous accounting principles

impact of inflation

     inflation affects the companys manufacturing costs and operating expenses
the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw
materials and fuelrelated costs in the past the company has generally passed
along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance
productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the
united states and mexico

seasonality

     the company is a calendar yearend company and its results of operations
for the first quarter tend to be the weakest the second third and fourth
quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income these results
are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering
which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year
following the holiday season

certain factors affecting the companys performance

     in addition to the other information provided in this form 10k the
following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in
shares of mohawk common stock

                                       23

page

     if any of the events described in these risks were to occur it could have
a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and
results of operations

the failure to integrate mohawk and daltile successfully by managing the

challenges of that integration may result in the company not achieving the

anticipated potential benefits of the merger


     the company will face challenges in consolidating functions integrating
its organizations procedures operations and product lines in a timely and
efficient manner and retaining key personnel

     these challenges will result principally because the two companies
currently

              maintain executive offices in different locations
              manufacture and sell different types of products through
               different distribution channels
              conduct their businesses from various locations
              maintain different operating systems and software on different
               computer hardware and
              have different employment and compensation arrangements for their
               employees

     in addition daltile has a significant manufacturing operation in mexico
and the company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility outside of
the united states as a result the integration will be complex and will require
additional attention from members of management the diversion of management
attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration
process could have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues level of
expenses and operating results

the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or

commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the

companys business


     the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and
commercial construction activity including new construction as well as
remodeling new construction activity and remodeling to a lesser degree are
cyclical in nature and a prolonged decline in residential or commercial
construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the companys
business financial condition and results of operations construction activity
is significantly affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond the
companys control including

              national and local economic conditions
              interest rates
              housing demand
              employment levels
              changes in disposable income
              financing availability
              commercial rental vacancy rates
              federal and state income tax policies and
              consumer confidence

     the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the
past which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry including
suppliers of floorcoverings the industry could experience similar downturns in
the future which could have a negative impact on the companys business
financial condition and results of operations

the company faces intense competition in its industry which could decrease

demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its

profitability


     the industry is highly competitive the company faces competition from a
large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors
of floorcovering products some of its existing and potential competitors may be
larger and have greater resources and access to capital than it does
maintaining the companys competitive position may require it to make
substantial investments in its product development efforts manufacturing
facilities distribution network and sales and marketing activities competitive
pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products and in the loss
of market share in addition the company faces and will continue to face
pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors as well as from large

                                       24

customers as a result of any of these factors there could be a material
adverse effect on the companys sales and profitability

a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates to complete acquisitions

and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material

adverse effect on the companys business


     as part of its business strategy the company intends to pursue
acquisitions of complementary businesses although it regularly evaluates
acquisition opportunities it may not be able to

              successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates
              obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund
               acquisitions
              complete acquisitions or
              profitably manage acquired businesses

     acquired operations may not achieve levels of sales operating income or
productivity comparable to those of its existing operations or otherwise
perform as expected acquisitions may also involve a number of special risks
some or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on the companys
business results of operations and financial condition including among
others

              the companys inability to integrate operations systems and
               procedures and to eliminate redundancies and excess costs
               effectively
              diversion of managements attention and resources and
              difficulty retaining and training acquired key personnel

the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis which could

have a material adverse effect on its business


     the companys business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw
materials from third party suppliers the principal raw materials used in its
manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin which are
used exclusively in its carpet and rug business talc clay impure nepheline
syenite pure nepheline syenite and various glazes including frit ground
glass zircon and stains which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile
business and other materials the company purchases all of its impure nepheline
syenite requirements from minnesota mining and manufacturing company and all of
its pure nepheline syenite requirements from unimin corporation unimin is the
only major supplier of pure nepheline syenite in north america an extended
interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the companys
business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the
companys operations which could have a material adverse effect on its
business financial condition and results of operations

the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of

raw materials and energy which could have a material adverse effect on its

profitability


     significant increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas used in
the manufacture of the companys products could have a material adverse effect
on its operating margins and its business financial condition and results of
operations the company purchases nylon fiber polypropylene resin talc clay
impure nepheline syenite pure nepheline syenite frit zircon stains and other
materials from third party suppliers the cost of some of these materials like
nylon and polypropylene resin is related to oil prices the company also
purchases significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in
some of its production processes the prices of these raw materials and of
natural gas vary with market conditions although the company generally attempts
to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its
customers the companys ability to do so is to a large extent dependent upon
the rate and magnitude of any increase competitive pressures and market
conditions for its products there have been in the past and may be in the
future periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be
recovered during such periods of time there could be a material adverse effect
on the companys profitability

the company has been and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities

under environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could be

significant


     the companys operations are subject to various federal state local and
foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those
governing air emissions wastewater discharges and the use storage treatment
and disposal of hazardous materials the applicable requirements under these
laws are subject to amendment to the imposition of new or additional
requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts new or
additional requirements could be imposed and the company could incur material
expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations

     the nature of the companys operations and previous operations by others at
real property currently or formerly owned or operated by the company and the
disposal of waste at third party sites exposes the company to the risk of claims
under environmental health and safety laws and regulations the company could
incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims the company
has been and will continue to be subject to these claims

     the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions changes in
environmental health and safety laws and regulations enforcement of existing
or new requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to
expenditures and liabilities including fines or penalties that could have a
material adverse effect on the companys business operating results or
financial condition

the company relies on its monterrey mexico plant for a significant portion of

its ceramic tile manufacturing capacity and any disruption in the plants

operations could negatively affect the companys business


     the companys monterrey mexico manufacturing facility represents a
significant portion of the companys total manufacturing capacity for ceramic
tile this facility contains five distinct manufacturing plants three of which
produce ceramic tile one of which produces frit used in the production of
manufactured tile and one of which produces refractories any disruption in the
operations of this facility could result in a material adverse effect on the
companys ceramic tile business and the companys operations as a whole

changes in international trade laws and in the business political and

regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the

companys business


     the companys operations in mexico include its monterrey facility
accordingly an event that has a material adverse impact on the companys
mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on its operations as a
whole the business regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from
those in the united states and the companys mexican operations are exposed to
a number of inherent risks including

              changes in international trade laws such as the north american
               free trade agreement or nafta affecting the companys import
               and export activities in mexico
              changes in mexican labor laws and regulations affecting the
               companys ability to hire and retain employees in mexico
              currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of
               foreign currency
              potentially adverse tax consequences
              local laws concerning repatriation of profits
              political conditions in mexico
              unexpected changes in the regulatory environment in mexico and
              changes in general economic conditions in mexico

future exchange rate fluctuations or inflation could have a material adverse

effect on the companys results of operations


     the companys mexican facility which is considered an extension of its
us operations primarily provides ceramic tile to the companys us
distribution network and to a more limited extent sells ceramic tile in
mexico the facility has more pesodenominated expenses than revenues this
means that the company realizes a benefit when the peso devalues against the
us dollar although this benefit may be offset by mexican

                                       26

inflation any future increases in the mexican inflation rate which are not
offset by devaluation of the peso may negatively impact the companys results
of operations the mexican peso has been and may in the future be subject to
significant fluctuations to the extent that the peso appreciates against the
us dollar there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business
financial condition and results of operations

the company could face increased competition as a result of the general

agreement on tariffs and trade and the north american free trade agreement


     the united states is party to the general agreement on tariffs and trade
gatt under gatt the united states currently imposes import duties on
ceramic tile imported from countries outside north america at no more than 13
to be reduced ratably to no less than 85 by 2004 accordingly as these duties
decrease gatt may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these countries
which now export or may seek to export ceramic tile to the united states the
company is uncertain what effect gatt may have on its operations

     the north american free trade agreement nafta was entered into by
canada mexico and the united states and over a transition period will remove
most customs duties imposed on goods traded among the three countries in
addition nafta will remove or limit many investment restrictions liberalize
trade in services provide a specialized means for settlement of and remedies
for trade disputes arising under its laws and will result in new laws and
regulations to further these goals although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on
the companys ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states
it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from
manufacturers located in mexico which could negatively affect the companys
business

item 11 executive compensation

report of the compensation committee of the board of directors of mohawk
industries inc

                                       51

page

executive compensation philosophy the committee believes that a compensation
program that enables the company to attract and retain outstanding executives
will assist the company in meeting its longrange objectives thereby serving
the interest of the companys stockholders the compensation program of the
company is designed to achieve the following objectives

     1  provide compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of
         companies of a similar size

     2  create a strong link between the executives compensation and the
         companys annual and longterm financial performance

     3  include above average elements of financial risk through
         performancebased incentive compensation which offers an opportunity
         for above average financial reward to the executives

     the companys executive compensation program has three components base
salaries annual incentives and longterm incentives

     base salaries the companys executive officers receive base salaries as
compensation for the skills knowledge and experience that they bring to their
positions base salaries paid to the companys executive officers are intended
to be maintained at a competitive level with companies of a similar size in
order to assess competitive rates in 2001 the committee used compensation
surveys produced by a nationally recognized compensation consulting firm of
executives with similar job functions and responsibilities in public companies
engaged in nondurable goods manufacturing in the same net sales range the group
of companies included in the surveys used was typically broader than the peer
group used in the performance graph following this report because the
competitive marketplace for executive talent has been viewed by the committee as
national in scope and not restricted to the carpet and textile industries with
respect to base salaries the committee has tried to achieve competitive rates
by targeting the approximate midpoint of the range of base salaries for
comparable positions within this overall policy the committee has preserved
the flexibility to make exceptions where performance over several years dictates
a higher base salary

     annual incentive bonuses annual incentive bonuses under the executive
incentive program are provided in addition to base salaries to create total
annual compensation using the compensation surveys discussed above the
committee has targeted the upper quartile of total annual compensation for
similarly situated executives in companies of similar size by placing a
significant portion of an executives annual pay at risk the committee
believes that compensation is more directly related to performance and will more
closely link the financial interests of the executives and those of the
stockholders given the companys aggressive business objectives the committee
believes this policy to be appropriate and fair for both the executives and the
stockholders

     the 2001 executive incentive program the plan was designed to provide
incentive bonus opportunities for 29 key executives of the company including
the executive officers named in the summary compensation table for those
executives who were classified as corporate participants including the chief
executive officer ceo and the chief financial officer to be eligible for
any bonus the total corporation must have attained in 2001 a threshold level of
earnings per share eps established by the committee for those executives
who were classified as residential business participants karastan business
participants commercial business participants home products participants or
hospitality business participants to be eligible for any bonus their business
unit must have attained in 2001 a threshold level of eps contribution
established by the committee the factors considered in establishing the
thresholds in the plan were the previous years eps for the total corporation
and eps contribution by each business unit if the threshold is attained then
the bonus calculation is based on the attainment of increasing levels of
improvement of i 2001 eps over 2000 eps and ii 2001 earnings after capital
charge eac after tax operating earnings less a cost of capital charge over
eac targets established by the committee using 2000 results as a base the bonus
calculation is weighted 75 to the eps level attained and 25 to the eac level
attained the bonus attainable at various levels in the plan is calculated as a
percentage of 2001 compensation payments excluding all bonus deferred bonus and
other nonsalary amounts base compensation the percentages of base
compensation for which individual participants become eligible at the various
levels vary and were set for the ceo by the committee and for the other
executives by the ceo subject to the approval of the committee in order to
relate performance goals to a targeted level of total annual compensation

     a portion of each award ranging from 20 to 26 is paid as follows
onehalf is paid in shares of the common stock purchased in the market and
issued to the participant as restricted shares under the mohawk industries inc
1997 longterm incentive plan and onehalf is used to pay withholding tax on the
award onehalf of the shares granted will be restricted for one year and the
other half for two years the number of restricted shares to be granted is
calculated using the average monthly closing stock price of the common stock
during 2001 the balance of the award is paid in cash to the participant in
2002

     the committee has the authority to interpret the plan make changes therein
or grant special bonuses for exceptional performance as it determines
appropriate

     longterm incentives the company provides longterm incentives to its
executives through stock option programs designed to encourage executives to
acquire and hold shares of common stock the stock option plans are designed to
retain executives and motivate them to improve the market value of the common
stock over a number of years the committee believes that equity ownership by
executives furthers the committees compensation policy objective of aligning
longterm financial interests of executives with those of the stockholders the
committee considers the amount and terms of options previously awarded to and
held by executive officers in determining the size of option grants in 2001
options were granted to all of the executive officers named in the summary
compensation table these options all vest in 20 annual increments

     other compensation plans the company maintains several broadlybased
employee benefit plans in which the executive officers are permitted to
participate on the same terms as other employees these include the retirement
savings plan designed to qualify under section 401k of the internal revenue
code a supplemental executive retirement plan which provides certain
supplemental retirement and other benefits to a certain executive who has
completed an aggregate of 60 months employment with the company and a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan for highly compensated employees which
permits deferral of income on a portion of the employees compensation

     to the extent readily determinable and as one of the factors in its
consideration of the various components of executive compensation the committee
considers the anticipated tax treatment to the company and to the executives of
various payments and benefits some types of compensation payments and their
deductibility eg the spread on exercise of nonqualified options depend
upon the timing of an executives vesting or exercise of previously granted
rights further interpretations of and changes in the tax laws and other
factors beyond the committees control also affect the deductibility of
compensation for these and other reasons the committee will not necessarily
and in all circumstances limit executive compensation to that deductible under
section 162m of the internal revenue code the committee will consider various
alternatives for preserving the deductibility of compensation payments and
benefits to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent consistent with
its other compensation objectives

     chief executive officer compensation in accordance with the compensation
philosophy and process described above the committee set mr lorberbaums base
salary for 2001 at 575000 which was below the midpoint for ceos of similar
sized companies in the surveys used by the committee mr lorberbaums total
annual cash compensation is linked to the companys performance by his
participation in the 2001 executive incentive program under the plan he would
earn no bonus unless 2001 eps exceeded the threshold level established in the
plan in 2001 mr lorberbaum earned a bonus equal to approximately 100 of his
base compensation based upon an improvement in eps for the total corporation of
18 percent over 2000 eps and an improvement in eac for the total corporation of
16 percent over 2000 eac this bonus will be paid in cash and restricted shares
as described above in 2001 mr lorberbaum was awarded stock options to
purchase 50000 shares of common stock at fair market value on the dates of the
grants these options vest in 20 annual increments

     the committees objectives in setting mr lorberbaum s compensation for
2001 were to be competitive with other companies in the carpet industry and with
other public companies of a similar size and to provide mr lorberbaum with
appropriate incentives to achieve the companys shortterm and longterm
objectives
