covid19 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 and its variants covid19 and its variants have had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and have increased and we expect will continue to increase our expenses including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking initial measures taken by businesses and governments beginning in 2020 led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on business and personal activities including a shift in healthcare priorities which resulted in a significant decline in elective medical procedures in 2020 some of these disruptions and impacts including the suspension or postponement of elective medical procedures in certain of our principal markets have continued into 2021 the pandemic has created significant volatility in the demand for our products for further information about our revenues by product category refer to note 10 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and overall impact of the covid19 pandemic for example concerns remain regarding the pace of economic recovery due to virus resurgence across the globe from the delta and omicron variants and other virus mutations as well as vaccine distribution and hesitancy the us and other governments may continue existing measures or implement new restrictions and other requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic including with respect to mandatory vaccinations for certain of our employees and moratoriums on elective procedures due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic our operating performance and financial results particularly in the short term may be subject to volatility we have experienced significant challenges including lengthy delays shortages and interruptions posed by the pandemic and other exogenous factors including significant weather events and disruptions to certain ports of call around the world to our global supply chain including the cost and availability of raw materials and component parts including resins and electromechanical devices and higher transportation costs and may experience these and other challenges in future periods many of our manufacturing plant and distribution center personnel are currently unvaccinated and we may also experience employee resistance in complying with current and future government vaccine and testing mandates which may cause labor shortages significantly impacting manufacturing production and distribution center productivity for us and our suppliers we expect that these challenges as well as evolving governmental restrictions and requirements among other factors may continue to have an adverse effect on our business for further discussion refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

for financial information about our segments see note 17 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we have our own direct sales force and also make sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers in the united states third parties such as cardinal health inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of our products through their distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries as of december 31 2021 

international operations 

the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the united states and geographic expansion remains a component of our strategy our presence includes operations in europe the middle east africa asiapacific latin america and canada we are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states for more information on these risks see the information under the captions “risks related to baxter’s business —we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally” and “—changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

for financial information about our foreign and domestic revenues and segment information see note 17 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

contractual arrangements 

our products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices in the case of 

hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members we have purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases we face competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with us purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities often act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across our markets globally additionally our contractual pricing arrangements with gpos idns and public contracting authorities limit our ability to increase prices in order to offset raw materials or component price increases or otherwise 

raw materials and component parts 

raw materials and component parts essential to our business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business while many of these materials are generally available we have experienced and may in the future experience shortages of supply additionally certain of these materials are secured from single source suppliers or on a spot basis and not pursuant to a contractual arrangement in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials and component supply we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability we also seek to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to our overall raw materials procurement strategy refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding risks related to the supply chain raw materials and component parts 

we are not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials and component parts through customer pricing due to contractual limits where applicable and market forces we seek to utilize longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

our businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of our product offerings and our strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics gpos idns physicians and patients many of whom selfadminister homebased therapies that we supply we also benefit from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of our products 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels we believe customer purchasing decisions are primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that we and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger 

organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients we face similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products for further discussion refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we own a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and have entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by us are sold primarily under our own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by us are sold under our trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by our suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to us we maintain certain details about our processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally require employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that our employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

our policy is to protect our products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for us we also recognize the need to promote the enforcement of our patents and trademarks and take commercially reasonable steps to enforce our patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes our environmental policies require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection for example we made 33 million and 10 million of capital expenditures in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to a new ethylene oxide emissions control system at our mountain home arkansas facility all material elements of the new system are expected to be completed in 2022 and we currently expect to incur an additional 10 million of capital expenditures related to this project 

human capital management 

as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 60000 people globally with approximately 19000 employees in the united states and approximately 41000 employees outside of the united states approximately 10000 of those employees joined our organization in december 2021 in connection with our acquisition of hillrom our employees are our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives they contribute to our success and in particular the employees in our manufacturing sales rd and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program 

the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and develop a diverse population of talented and highperforming employees at all levels of our organization including the individuals who 

comprise our global workforce as well as executive officers and other key personnel to succeed in a competitive labor market we have developed recruitment and retention strategies objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business these strategies objectives and measures form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs policies and initiatives

• activating change today act building on our strong diversity and inclusion platform our senior leadership is working in close collaboration with the baxter black alliance business resource group and colleagues from across the company on a multidimensional program to advance inclusion and racial justice the act initiative is focused on driving results across four key areas – workforce workplace community and marketplace – encompassing employees external stakeholders and the markets and communities we serve 

• health and safety health and safety are firmly rooted across our global footprint in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we implemented changes in our business in 2020 in an effort to better protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for employees in our administrative functions while our essential workers production and field service employees have continued to work at our facilities and provide vital services to our customers most employees in our administrative functions have effectively worked remotely since march 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k annual report stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition results of operations future growth prospects and stock price could suffer 

risks relating to the covid19 pandemic 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have had and we expect will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses including due to preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments have taken and may continue to take these measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities we expect that evolving restrictions and precautions as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business risks associated with covid19 include but are not limited to the following 

• we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers reprioritize the treatment of patients some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures for example due to the recent spread of the omicron variant many elective procedures have been suspended or postponed in our principal markets as hospital systems prioritize treatment of covid19 patients again or otherwise comply with changing government guidelines it is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures or whether once resumed further delays or cancellations may occur in the future in connection with the spread of new variants if patients and hospital systems continue to deprioritize delay or cancel elective procedures our business financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected 

• a significant number of our suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including with respect to increased absenteeism among their employees and other obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their onsite operations these impacts have caused interruptions and delays in our supply chain and may continue to do so resulting in more expensive alternative sources of labor and materials and heightened supply chain costs any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges impacts our ability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability for example we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products as such materials are being used to produce covid19 vaccines these constraints have resulted in certain product backorders and may do so in the future 

• we could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments reduced demand or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues these liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services 

• covid19 has adversely impacted the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations for example we have faced increased absenteeism in connection with the rise of recent covid19 variants although we have sought to mitigate these staffing challenges through overtime and enlisting contingent labor staffing shortages have strained our operations and increased our expenses in addition we may be unable to retain employees who object to governmental vaccine mandates or heightened safety protocols vaccination is currently required for employees who are customerfacing andor directly engaged with hospitals and medical care providers covered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by covid19 and are not available to perform their professional duties we could experience further disruptions in our manufacturing operations or disruptions in other activities and other functions 

• we face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety including through office closures vaccine mandates and work from home policies for example remote working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks including cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breaches and telecommunication failures both for systems and networks we control directly and for those 

that employees and thirdparty developers rely on to work remotely any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm these risks are particularly heightened due to covid‑19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from covidrelated disruptions 

any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations finally to the extent covid19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section may be heightened 

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and needs and advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives we can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace in addition difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals including as a result of the covid19 pandemic might delay or prohibit introduction of new products into the marketplace we may not be able to obtain patent protection on our new products or be able to defend our intellectual property rights globally warranty claims and service costs relating to our new products might be greater than anticipated and we might be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters in addition the introduction of new products might also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products our future financial performance will also depend in part on our ability to influence anticipate identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs including those impacted by the covid19 pandemic we might not correctly anticipate or identify trends in customer preferences or needs or might identify them later than competitors do 

failure to successfully introduce new products in a costeffective manner or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business furthermore product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the rd process a successful product development process further depends on many other factors including our ability to adapt to new technologies demonstrate satisfactory clinical results and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer 

issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products among other negative consequences 

our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products and the underlying raw materials and component parts the medical products and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels these levels vary in response to economic conditions regulatory requirements seasonality natural disasters pandemics epidemics and other matters for example for many of our suppliers the covid19 pandemic has created increased employee absenteeism rates and other obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their onsite operations these increased rates and other obstacles have increased the cost of certain raw materials and component parts and caused us to incur increased freight costs they may in the future prevent suppliers from providing good and services to us on reasonable terms or at all 

additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive as a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory increased costs relating to freight raw materials or component parts and difficulties hiring and retaining staff have had and may continue to have a negative impact on product supply failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price 

our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products while we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products new or unintended uses of our products for example in response to covid19 or changing clinical practice may also raise quality or safety issues a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls either voluntary or required by fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions which may include corporate integrity agreements costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations many of whom do so on a spot basis and not pursuant to a contractual arrangement our ability to receive goods or services at all or on reasonable financial terms from these third parties will be impacted if they are unable or refuse to supply or service us moreover we may have limited or no recourse if the goods or services are not subject to contractual terms if we are unable to identify an alternative provider on reasonable terms our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation additionally third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a thirdparty supplier to provide compliant raw materials component parts or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect our operating results 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation 

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our business financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable 

in addition many healthcare industry companies including healthcare systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

demand for our products and services depends in large part on overall demand in the healthcare market with the healthcare market’s increased focus on hospital asset and resource efficiency as well as reimbursement constraints spending for some of our products could decline over time further the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our commercial investments or reduce our prices which could adversely impact our operating results these factors along with possible legislative developments and others might result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants which includes us accordingly if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of new products and 

diversification of our product portfolio through business acquisitions then our market share sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the hillrom acquisition 

during 2021 we completed the acquisition of hillrom the success of this acquisition depends on among other things our ability to integrate hillrom in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities realizes anticipated cost and revenue synergies some of which are still being identified and achieves certain previously communicated net leverage targets without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the hillrom acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition these difficulties include challenges consolidating certain operations and functions including regulatory and other corporate functions integrating technologies including differing it systems and processes organizations procedures policies and operations addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel the integration may be complex and time consuming and involve delays or additional and unforeseen expenses the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the hillrom acquisition may also disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with market participants employees regulators and others with whom we and hillrom have business or other dealings any failure to successfully or costeffectively integrate hillrom could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause reputational harm 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful we may not realize the intended benefits 

we expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of our resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess rd projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes for more information see note 2 in item 8 of this annual report 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing information technology and rd positions and from the recently acquired hillrom business competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment including our competitors’ policies regarding remote work arrangements and covid19 protocols and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

risks related to our business operations 

segments of our business are significantly dependent on major contracts with gpos idns and certain other distributors and purchasers 

a portion of our us hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital gpos at any given time we are typically at various stages of responding to bids negotiating and renewing expiring gpo agreements failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

including product sales and service and rental revenue in addition we have faced and continue to face challenges related to increasing costs associated with these agreements associated with ongoing supply chain challenges which negatively impact our revenues 

our participation in such programs often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices and failure to participate or to be selected for participation in such programs might result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals in addition the industry is showing an increased focus on contracting directly with health systems or idns which typically represent influential members and owners of gpos idns and health systems often make key purchasing decisions and have influence over the gpo’s contract decisions and often request additional discounts or other enhancements further certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the gpos and idns and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring realignment and cost reduction activities 

portions of our business have been and following the hillrom acquisition may be the subject of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives while we initiate these actions with the goal of realizing efficiencies we may not be successful in achieving the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits we expect further such benefits might be realized later than expected and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures might be greater than anticipated if these measures are not successful or sustainable we might undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in future charges moreover our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective these actions the resulting costs and potential delays or potential lower than anticipated benefits might also impact our foreign tax positions and might require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business 

we have incurred a substantial amount of debt in connection with the hillrom acquisition which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have incurred acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 118 billion to fund the cash consideration for the hillrom acquisition refinance certain indebtedness of hillrom and pay related fees and expenses our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following the acquisition has the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and has increased our borrowing costs including as a result of the downgrade in our senior debt credit ratings the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for investments in product development capital expenditures dividend payments acquisitions share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels in addition until we achieve our commitment to reduce our indebtedness following the hillrom acquisition our capital allocation activities and operational flexibility may be limited there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on a timely basis or at all 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or if we experience other manufacturing sterilization supply or distribution difficulties our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires among other things the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from ourselves for selfsupplied requirements we endeavor either alone or working closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified additionally we obtain certain components and materials on a spot basis from third party suppliers with whom we do not have a contractual arrangement for most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption such measures may not be sufficient or effective a reduction interruption or suspension in supply other supply chain issues including those due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply 

could adversely affect our ability to manufacture distribute and sell our products in a timely or costeffective manner we have faced difficulties obtaining supplies of key materials such as electromechanical components active ingredients for pharmaceuticals and resins due to the covid19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions moreover changes in regulation world trade policies international taxes and governmenttogovernment relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” 

additionally volatility in our costs of energy transportationfreight components raw materials and other supply manufacturing and distribution costs have had and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations these prices might continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions labor costs delivery costs competition and currency exchange rates 

significant increases in the cost of raw materials subassemblies or materials used in the production of our products that cannot be recovered through increased prices of our products or the unavailability of those raw materials subassemblies or production materials could adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity cost increases in the future we may from time to time engage in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases but do enter into fixed price supply contracts at times future decisions not to engage in hedging transactions or ineffective hedging transactions might result in increased cost volatility potentially adversely impacting our profitability 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing devices and pharmaceuticals including biologics as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site additionally some of our manufacturing facilities are located in the same geographic area loss or damage to or closure of a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster such as we experienced as a result of hurricane maria a pandemic such as covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences including those identified in the paragraphs above we might be unable to transfer manufacturing of the relevant products to another facility or location in a costeffective or timely manner if at all this potential inability to transfer production could occur for several reasons including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility or the regulatory requirements of the fda or other governmental regulatory bodies such an event could materially negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution and we utilize both baxterowned and thirdparty facilities for this process if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure whether temporarily or permanent of one or more of these facilities we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all and a third party may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace sterilization capacity 

for example in may 2021 our facility in mountain home arkansas entered into a consent administrative order with the arkansas division of environmental quality relating to certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxideemissions from sterilization equipment although the events giving rise to the consent administrative order only caused a temporary pause in operations these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience whether due to lack of capacity environmental regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise could result in product shortage unanticipated costs loss of revenues litigation and damage to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the longterm effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread the impacts of climate change may include physical risks eg rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions including natural disasters social and human effects eg population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing compliance costs and transition risks eg regulatory or technology changes shifts in market trends eg customers increasingly prioritize purchasing products that are sustainably made and other adverse effects such impacts may disrupt our supply chain and operations by adversely affecting our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require due to impairment of the availability and cost of certain products materials commodities and energy for example material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials or resins we use to make and package our products as well as our transportationfreight costs these outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price 

in addition the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions and the establishment of enhanced internal processes or systems to track them alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the united states or in any other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations we may experience disruptions in or increases in the costs associated with sourcing manufacturing and distributing our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operations any such regulatory changes could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and comply with other regulatory requirements 

breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data including from cyber security breaches and data leakage could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation and competitive position 

we rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure including support provided by our partners and third parties to support our business products and customers for example we routinely rely on technology systems and infrastructure in the collection use storage and transfer disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential business financial personal and other sensitive information collectively confidential information we also rely on systems for manufacturing customer orders shipping regulatory compliance and various other matters certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes some of our products even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems connect to hospital networks electronic medical records or electronic health records the continuing evolution of technology we use including cloudbased computing and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional intentional andor unauthorized exposure dissemination andor destruction of confidential information stored in our devices systems servers infrastructure and products collectively technology security threats including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated frequent and adaptive 

our technology is vulnerable to breakdown interruption cyber and other security attacks system malfunction unauthorized access inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information theft and other events thirdparty systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems any such vulnerability could compromise our technology and could expose confidential information to unauthorized third parties andor cause permanent loss of such data in addition to loss of confidential information unauthorized access to or interference with our technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety field actions andor product recalls we have like other large multinational companies experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and technology there can be no assurance that our efforts have prevented or will prevent breakdowns attacks breaches in our technology cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and 

privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that host or process confidential information on our behalf such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other confidential information and could pose a risk to patient safety any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties business disruption reputational harm financial loss litigation as well as other damages misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” as the fda other regulators and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness we could also suffer strained relationships with customers business partners physicians and other healthcare professionals increased costs for security measures remediation or otherwise litigation including class actions and stockholder derivative actions or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price from breaches cyber and other security attacks industrial espionage ransomware email or phishing scams malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners 

in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities further a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of related variants which among other things could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems we also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company for example as we integrate hillrom into our business we may identify vulnerabilities or other issues as we transition its information technology systems and processes to our processes and controls including with respect to cybersecurity and privacy any such vulnerabilities if unidentified or unremediated could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials and component parts changes in taxation tariffs export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability monetary or currency volatility or instability including as it relates to the us dollar the euro the yuan and currencies in emerging market countries including the turkish lira disputes between countries trade relationships and conflicts diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including natural disaster pandemic power loss cyberattack data breach war terrorism riot labor disruption civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the us china and russia could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by these countries through petitioning the governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions tariff exclusions awarded to us by the us government require annual renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift the us china and russia could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to the markets 

more generally several governments have raised the possibility of policies to induce “reshoring” of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production for example the chinese government has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote local medical devices or suggest government procurement budget for local products another example would be the stronger “buy american” requirements in the us pursuant to a us executive order by the new administration on january 25 2021 or us withdrawal from the world trade organization agreement on government procurement gpa if such steps triggered retaliation in other markets such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations 

some of our employees both in and outside of the united states including contingent workers work under collective bargaining agreements andor national trade union agreements although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future two collective bargaining agreements for one of our us manufacturing facilities are scheduled to expire in february 2022 and january 2024 respectively on february 23 2022 union members are scheduled to vote on whether to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement in place of the one scheduled to expire in february 2022 or to authorize a potential strike our inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at any of our manufacturing facilities including at the facility with a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in february 2022 could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

we are subject to a number of laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states 

laws and regulations include the patient protection and affordable health care act hr 3590 and the health care and education reconciliation act hr 4872 collectively the healthcare reform act which aim to decrease costs through comparative effectiveness research and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies compliance with these and similar regulations could result in pricing pressure or negatively impact the demand for our products in a number of situations even though specific laws and regulations may not directly apply to us our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities the same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations for example certain of our medical devices have to comply with the new european union medical device regulation that entered into force in may 2021 these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member states to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and ongoing product monitoring responsibilities and obtain a “ce” marking ie a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the european economic area for their products various penalties exist for noncompliance with the laws implementing the european medical device regulations which if incurred could have a material adverse impact on portions of our business results of operations and cash flows changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions reputational damage injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses in addition our efforts to comply with fda regulations have been challenged by the ongoing covid19 pandemic for example our attempts to rectify an outstanding warning letter for our facility in ahmedabad have been thwarted as the fda inspectors cannot travel to the site to evaluate our remediation efforts the failure of our suppliers to comply with regulations could also adversely affect segments of our business as regulatory actions taken by the fda against those manufacturers can result in product shortages recalls or modifications any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

our business is also subject to risks associated with us and foreign legislation regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import including quotas duties tariffs or taxes other charges or restrictions on imports and the nature of materials that can be used in our products which could adversely affect our operations and our 

ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels we cannot predict whether additional us and foreign customs quotas duties including antidumping or countervailing duties tariffs taxes or other charges or restrictions requirements as to where raw materials and component parts must be purchased additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations future quotas duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us or increase our costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device and pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities the doj and the sec have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of medical product and pharmaceutical companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of medical product and pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion pricing sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the physician payments sunshine act can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly 

we are also subject to environmental laws which are becoming more stringent throughout the world for example the epa regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices as is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers or result in liability to us 

additionally the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign control and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries or with governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions including iran sudan syria russia and cuba these dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change 

we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and changes which may be violated unknowingly could require us to incur substantial costs regarding compliance or to alter our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict with certainty what laws regulations and healthcare initiatives if any will be implemented or what the ultimate effect of healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us for more information related to ongoing government investigations see note 7 in item 8 of this annual report for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us including qualityrelated matters see “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability 

as a global company we are subject to global data privacy and security laws regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data in the united states and in other countries including but not limited to the health insurance portability and accountability act as amended hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the california consumer privacy act ccpa and the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr the gdpr imposes stringent european union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance hipaa also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures we or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation 

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or in foreign countries including through the implementation or repeal of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers these payers include medicare medicaid and private healthcare insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the united states our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies including government reporting and auditing additional regulatory oversight mandated contractual terms failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements 

public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies which are lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in much of europe latin america asia and australia the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products for example china has been implementing volumebased procurement policies a series of centralized reforms being instituted in china on both a national and regional basis that has resulted in significant price cuts for pharmaceuticals and medical consumables additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products in addition our recent acquisition of hillrom has increased our exposure to risks related to reimbursement as certain portions of that business directly bill various government agencies 

the healthcare reform act includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs the healthcare reform act reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure certain portions of the healthcare reform act could negatively impact the demand for our products and therefore our results of operations and financial position 

in 2019 the us department of health and human services launched a new kidney health initiative the cms published the final end stage renal disease treatment choices mandatory payment model etc in 2020 the etc launched in 30 of dialysis clinics across the country on january 1 2021 and creates payment incentives for the 

greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those new to and already on dialysis cms also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with latestage chronic kidney disease and esrd cms has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation cms launched the program on january 1 2022 at which time 85 entities or potential customers were enrolled as participants these proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the us end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products necessitating significant multiyear capital expenditures in order to meet that demand however the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance 

in addition a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement and any disruptions in federal government operations including a federal government shutdown or failure of the us government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 

we could be subject to fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business 

portions of our business are subject to stringent laws and regulations at the federal or state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers and independent diagnostic testing facilities in federal and state healthcare programs from time to time the government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs on occasion these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds at other times our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments we believe the frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has grown and we expect this will continue in the future due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state medicaid level and greater sophistication in data review techniques 

in addition our business contracts with foreign and us federal state and local government entities and is subject to specific rules regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors our failure to comply with these could result in contract terminations suspension or debarment from contracting with these entities civil fines and damages criminal prosecution and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid as well as possible recoupment of any overpayments related to such violations while we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state and federal requirements the requirements might be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations even if inadvertent could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties an unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of 

sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public 

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

furthermore our intellectual property proprietary technology and sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property confidential information and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

changes to the tax laws in the united states or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results for example the build back better framework if enacted as proposed by president biden could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations similarly the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the organization of economic cooperation and development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions which could adversely impact our global tax obligations 

taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities our tax liabilities are affected by many factors including the amounts we charge in intracompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate although we believe that we transact intracompany business in accordance with armslength principles tax authorities may disagree with our intracompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 annual report on form 10k 

we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 12 in item 8 of this annual report 

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits settlement discussions mediations arbitrations and other disputes including for example the superfund cases opioid litigation ethylene oxide litigation linet antitrust litigation and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records related to the restatement of certain of our financial statements as set forth in note 7 in item 8 of this annual report in addition in the future we may be party to additional lawsuits disputes or other matters including patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in our current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these current matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation and other disputes including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on our business 

operations or financial condition even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

risks related to the economy and our financial performance 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally which could result in decreased demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could disrupt our ability to produce products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses and may also impact the stability of the us dollar euro or yuan 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors including in emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable for more information see “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall or increase in supply chain or other costs may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as an indication of future performance our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section these fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price 

we may not achieve our financial goals 

we continue to evaluate and refine both our shortterm and longterm financial objectives including our stated commitment to achieve certain net leverage targets after completion of the hillrom acquisition our ability to achieve these targets depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and related cost and revenue synergy targets while continuing to strengthen our portfolio and extend our impact through transformative innovation we may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future material impairments in the value of our longlived assets including goodwill could negatively affect our operating results 

we regularly review our longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets goodwill which results from our acquisition activity and property plant and equipment for impairment goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the 

future in addition we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy including in connection with strategic exits future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations for more information on the valuation and impairment of longlived assets see “critical accounting policies” in item 7 of this annual report

strategic objectives 

we continue to focus on several key objectives to successfully execute our longterm strategy to achieve sustainable growth and deliver enhanced stockholder value our diversified and broad portfolio of medical products that treat lifethreatening acute or chronic conditions and our global presence are core components of our strategy to achieve these objectives we are focused on three strategic factors as part of our pursuit of industry leading performance optimizing our core portfolio globally operational excellence focused on streamlining our cost structure and enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation 

optimizing the core portfolio globally 

our global product portfolio optimization strategy identifies products that we believe to have characteristics of core growth products that we expect to provide us with a core return on capital products that we intend to maintain or manage differently and products that we consider to be strategic bets for products with core growth characteristics we look to invest for longterm higher margin growth for products that we expect to generate a core return on capital we seek to optimize our return on investment and to maintain or enhance our market position for products that we intend to maintain or manage differently we look to sustain or reposition our underlying investment finally we are evaluating our market position and investment strategy for products that we consider to be strategic bets 

as part of our portfolio management strategy we seek to optimize our position in product areas where we have a stable profitable business model and identify and alter investments in products that have reached the end of their life cycles or for which market positions have evolved unfavorably in the course of doing so we expect to continue to reallocate capital to more promising opportunities or business groupings as described above additionally to the extent we identify areas that do not align with our longerterm objectives we will look to exit or divest these businesses while also continuing to identify new opportunities to enhance future performance 

as part of this strategy we are shifting our investments to drive innovation in product areas where we have compelling opportunities to serve patients and healthcare professionals while advancing our business and we are accelerating the pace in which we bring these advances to market we are in the midst of launching several new products geographic expansions and line extensions including in such areas as chronic and acute renal care smart pump technology hospital pharmaceuticals and nutritionals surgical sealants and more these comprise a mix of entirely new offerings improvements on existing technologies and the expansion of current products into new geographies we are also evaluating product development opportunities that leverage the newly acquired hillrom portfolio 

operational excellence 

in recent years we have undertaken a comprehensive review of all aspects of our operations and are actively implementing changes in line with our business goals as part of our pursuit of improved margin performance we are working to optimize our cost structure and we are critically assessing optimal support levels in light of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts and the hillrom integration we intend to continue to actively manage our cost structure to help ensure that we are committing resources to the highest value uses such high value activities include supporting innovation building out the portfolio expanding patient access and accelerating growth for our stockholders 

maintaining disciplined and balanced capital allocation 

subject to market conditions and our investment grade targets our capital allocation strategies include the following 

• reinvest in the business by funding opportunities that are positioned to deliver sustainable growth support our innovation efforts and improve margin performance 

• return capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases and 

• identify and pursue accretive merger and acquisition ma opportunities

risks and uncertainties related to covid19 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the covid19 pandemic covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and we expect will continue to increase our expenses including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments have taken and continue to take initial measures taken in 2020 led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on business and personal activities including a shift in healthcare priorities which resulted in a significant decline in medical procedures in 2020 some of these disruptions and impacts including the suspension or postponement of elective medical procedures in certain of our principal markets have continued into 2021 the pandemic has created significant volatility in the demand for our products for further discussion refer to the product category net sales reporting section below significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and overall impact of the covid19 pandemic for example concerns remain regarding the pace of economic recovery due to virus resurgence across the globe from the delta and omicron variants and other virus mutations as well as vaccine distribution and hesitancy the us and other governments may continue existing measures or implement new restrictions and other requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic including with respect to mandatory vaccinations for certain of our employees and moratoriums on elective procedures due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic our operating performance and financial results particularly in the short term may be subject to volatility we have experienced significant challenges including lengthy delays shortages and interruptions posed by the pandemic and other exogenous factors including significant weather events and disruptions to certain ports of call around the world to our global supply chain including the cost and availability of raw materials and component parts including resins and electromechanical devices and higher transportation costs and may experience these and other challenges in future periods we expect that these challenges as well as evolving governmental restrictions and requirements among other factors may continue to have an adverse effect on our business for further discussion refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

risk factors 

our ability to sustain longterm growth and successfully execute the strategies discussed above depends in part on our ability to manage within an increasingly competitive and regulated environment and to address the other risk factors described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

special items 

the following table provides a summary of our special items and the related impact by line item on our results for 2021 and 2020 

intangible asset amortization expense is identified as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance and is consistent with how management and our board of directors internally assess performance additional special items are identified above because they are highly variable difficult to predict and of a size that may substantially impact our results of operations for a period management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on our results in accordance with us gaap may provide a more complete understanding of our operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of our results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

4 our results in 2021 included acquisition integration and related financing expenses of 240 million this included acquisition integration and related financing expenses for our acquisition of hillrom and the acquisition of the rights to caelyx and doxil for specified territories outside of the us these expenses were partially offset by benefits from changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities our results in 2020 included 40 million of acquisition and integration expenses this included acquisition and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cheetah medical inc cheetah seprafilm and inprocess rd assets partially offset by a benefit related to the change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities refer to note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding business development activities 

5 our results in 2021 and 2020 included costs of 42 million and 33 million respectively related to updating our quality systems and product labeling to comply with the new medical device reporting regulation and other requirements of the european union’s regulations for medical devices that become effective in stages beginning in 2021

11 reflected in this item is the income tax impact of the special items identified in this table the tax effect of each special item is based on the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred and the tax laws in effect for each such jurisdiction 

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 10 at actual and 7 at constant currency rates 

foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by 3 percentage points during 2021 compared to the prioryear period principally due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro australian dollar british pound chinese renminbi and canadian dollar 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect current year local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period we believe that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the us gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding and facilitate a fuller analysis of our results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

in 2021 the acquisition of hillrom and the rights to caleyx and doxil for specified territories outside of the us contributed 212 million and 108 million respectively in net sales 

as a result of the increase in covid19 cases in late 2021 and early 2022 we have experienced higher levels of absenteeism at our manufacturing facilities in addition a number of our suppliers are experiencing similar staffing challenges which together with other supply chain constraints in the current environment has limited the availability of certain raw materials and component parts used in our products these conditions have decreased our current production levels which we expect to adversely impact our sales growth during the first quarter of 2022 we currently expect these conditions to improve and our production levels to normalize over the course of 2022

interest expense net

other expense net 

other expense net was 41 million and 190 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the net expense in 2021 was primarily driven by foreign exchange net losses and pension and opeb net expenses the net expense in 2020 was primarily driven by a 110 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to our november 2020 redemption of 750 million of senior notes that were issued in march 2020 foreign exchange net losses of 49 million and 46 million of pension settlement charges which included a 43 million charge related to lumpsum settlement distributions made to certain former us employees with vested pension benefits these expenses in 2020 were partially offset by net unrealized gains of 13 million related to marketable equity securities 

we expect expenses from pension and opeb plans to decrease in 2022 primarily due to prior year actuarial gains that will reduce ongoing benefit costs refer to note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding pension and opeb plan expenses

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 123 in 2021 and 141 in 2020 the special items identified above had a favorable impact of 45 and 26 percentage points on the effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 respectively refer to the special items section above for additional detail our effective income tax rate can differ from the 21 us federal statutory rate due to a number of factors including foreign rate differences tax incentives increases or decreases in valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 the difference between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to favorable geographic earnings mix a 58 million tax benefit related to a taxdeductible foreign statutory loss on an investment in a foreign subsidiary a tax benefit related to a change in us foreign tax credit regulations and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards partially offset by an unfavorable court decision in a foreign jurisdiction related to an uncertain tax position 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the difference between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to favorable geographic earnings mix and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards 

our tax provisions for 2021 and 2020 do not include any tax charges related to either the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat or global intangible low taxed income gilti provisions except for the inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits against such gilti our accounting policy is to recognize any gilti charge as a period cost 

we anticipate that our effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with us gaap will be approximately 17 in 2022 this rate may be further impacted by a number of factors including discrete items such as tax windfalls or deficiencies attributable to stock compensation awards additional audit developments or the tax effects of any future special items

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows from operations — continuing operations 

in 2021 and 2020 cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion and 19 billion respectively operating cash flows increased in 2021 primarily due to a lower increase in inventories in 2021 compared to 2020 an increase in our net income in 2021 payments of 173 million to settle interest rate derivative contracts in 2020 and lower

credit facilities and access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facilities 

on september 30 2021 we entered into a new us dollardenominated revolving credit facility the usd revolver and on october 1 2021 we amended our existing eurodenominated revolving credit facility as amended the euro revolver as of december 31 2021 our usd revolver had capacity of 25 billion and our euro revolver had a capacity of approximately €200 million each of the facilities matures in 2026 the facilities enable us to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants including a maximum net 

leverage ratio fees under the credit facilities are 009 annually as of december 31 2021 and are based on our credit ratings and the total capacity of the facility prior to entering into the usd revolver and the euro revolver our previous us dollardenominated revolving credit facility and eurodenominated senior revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of 20 billion and €200 million respectively fees under these credit facilities were 009 annually as of december 31 2020 and were based on our credit ratings and the total capacity of the facility there were no borrowings under these credit facilities as of december 31 2021 or december 31 2020 as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by the institution’s respective commitment 

we also maintain other credit arrangements as described in note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

access to capital and credit ratings 

we intend to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand and future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt we had 30 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2021 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate we invest our excess cash in money market and other funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 177 billion of longterm debt and finance lease obligations including current maturities and shortterm debt subject to market conditions and our investment grade targets we regularly evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure 

our ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt including commercial paper or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however we believe we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives and reduce our postacquisition debt levels 

our credit ratings at december 31 2021 were as follows 

our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded in 2021 as a result of the debt we issued to fund the hillrom acquisition 

libor reform 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the london interbank offered rate libor and other interbank offered rates which have been widely used as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts including loans debt and derivatives this announcement indicated that the continuation of libor on the current basis was not guaranteed after 2021 regulators in the us and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr in 2020 it was announced that certain us dollar libor tenors would not cease until 2023 currently our 25 billion us dollardenominated revolving credit facility our €200 million eurodenominated revolving credit facility and our 40 billion term loan credit agreement reference liborbased rates the discontinuation of libor will require these arrangements to be modified in order to replace libor with an alternative reference interest rate which could impact our cost of funds our credit facilities and term loan credit agreement include provisions related to the determination of a successor libor rate 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities payable or maturing in the following periods 



1 interest payments on debt and finance lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2021 certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2021 refer to note 5 and note 6 respectively in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion regarding our debt instruments outstanding and finance lease obligations at december 31 2021 

2 the primary components of other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 are pension and other postretirement benefits deferred tax liabilities longterm tax liabilities and litigation and environmental reserves we projected the timing of the related future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates where applicable and estimates of the timing of payments for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates the actual timing of payments could differ from our estimates 

we contributed 73 million and 74 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and 2020 respectively the timing of funding in future periods is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes cash outflows related to our pension plans the amount included within other noncurrent liabilities and excluded from the table above related to our pension plan liabilities was 858 million as of december 31 2021 in 2022 we have no obligation to fund our principal plans in the united states and we expect to make contributions of at least 41 million to our foreign pension plans additionally we have excluded longterm tax liabilities which include liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax liabilities from the table above because we are unable to estimate the timing of the related cash outflows the amounts of longterm tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities included within other noncurrent liabilities and excluded from the table above were 80 million and 962 million respectively as of december 31 2021 

3 includes our significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations for cancellable agreements any penalty due upon cancellation is included these commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business examples include firm commitments for raw material and component part purchases utility agreements and service contracts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we periodically enter into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties we may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of our significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding receivable transactions and note 2 and note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements indemnifications and legal contingencies 

financial instrument market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates our hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on our judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 15 and note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our financial instruments and hedging strategies 

currency risk 

we are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese renminbi korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen colombian peso brazilian real mexican peso turkish lira indian rupee and swedish krona we manage our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows us to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition we use derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange however these instruments may be unavailable or inefficient in emerging or volatile markets gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange however we dont hedge our entire foreign exchange exposure and are still subject to earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange risk financial market and currency volatility may limit our ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

we use options and forwards to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the maximum term over which we have cash flow hedge contracts in place related to foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions as of december 31 2021 is 12 months we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk on certain intracompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 

as part of our riskmanagement program we perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of our foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2021 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies the net pretax asset balance of 3 million with respect to those contracts would change by 34 million a similar analysis performed with respect to contracts outstanding as of december 31 2020 indicated that on a pretax basis the net liability balance of 8 million would change by 32 million 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2021 by replacing the actual exchange rates as of december 31 2021 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

our subsidiary in argentina is reported using highly inflationary accounting effective july 1 2018 changes in the value of the argentine peso applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset positions are recorded in income at the time of the change as of december 31 2021 our net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos are not significant 

interest rate risk 

we are also exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates our policy is to manage interest costs using the mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that we believe is appropriate at that time to manage this mix in a costefficient manner we periodically enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount we also periodically use forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt as of december 31 2021 there were no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding and we had approximately 49 billion of outstanding floating rate debt a 100 basis point change in 

interest rates would impact out pretax earnings and cash flows by approximately 49 million over a oneyear period 

changes in accounting standards 

refer to note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on changes in accounting standards 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2021 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 202105 leases topic 842 which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease if 1 the lease would have been classified as a salestype or direct financing lease and 2 the lessor would have recognized a selling loss at lease commencement these changes are intended to avoid recognizing a dayone loss for a lease with variable payments even though the lessor expects the arrangement will be profitable overall the standard is effective for our financial statements beginning in 2022 the impact of the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as these policies are the most important to the depiction of our financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by us often employing the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from our estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our results of operations and financial position the following is a summary of accounting policies that we consider critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price transaction price which includes estimates of variable consideration primarily related to rebates and wholesaler chargebacks these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales our estimates take into consideration historical experience current contractual and statutory requirements specific known market events and trends industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns overall these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract the amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period additionally our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determining the allocation of the transaction price may require significant judgment 

pension and opeb plans 

we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees the service component of employee benefit expenses is reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statements as the applicable employee’s compensation expense all other components of these employee benefit expenses are reported in other expense net in our consolidated statements of income the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

• interest rates used to discount pension and opeb plan liabilities 

• the longterm rate of return on pension plan assets 

• rates of increases in employee compensation used in estimating liabilities 

• anticipated future healthcare trend rates used in estimating the opeb plan liability and 

• other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover used in estimating liabilities 

selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results 

our key assumptions are listed in note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2021 measurement date we utilized discount rates of 301 and 276 to measure our benefit obligations for our most significant us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively we used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2021 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds we would most likely select if we were to actually annuitize our pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and other european countries we use a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for our other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost we perform a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 30 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 35 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2021 we used a longterm expected rate of return of 55 for our most significant pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will decrease to 5 in 2022 this assumption is not applicable to our opeb plan because it is not funded 

we establish the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on our asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both our actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost we perform a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 15 million 

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans we used the pri2012 combined mortality table with improvements projected using the mp2019 projection scale adjusted to a longterm improvement of 08 as of december 31 2021 for all other pension plans we utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations we periodically analyze and update our assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

we maintain valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business we are audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and are periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities we prevail in positions for which reserves have been established or we are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

realization of the us and foreign operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depends on generating sufficient future earnings a valuation allowance of 401 million and 454 million was recognized as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively to reduce the deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because we do not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized prior to expiration after evaluating relevant us tax laws any elections or other opportunities that may be available and the future expiration of certain us tax provisions that will impact the utilization of our us foreign tax credit carryforwards management expects to be able to realize some but not all of the us foreign tax credit deferred tax assets up to its overall domestic loss odl balance plus other recurring and nonrecurring foreign inclusions therefore a valuation allowance of 98 million and 157 million was recognized with respect to the foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we will continue to evaluate the need for additional valuation allowances and as circumstances change the valuation allowance may change 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

as a result of our acquisition of hillrom in december 2021 our intangible asset balance increased to 78 billion as of december 31 2021 compared to 17 billion as of december 31 2020 we record acquired intangible assets at fair value in business combinations and at cost in asset acquisitions valuations are generally completed for intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis an income approach incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis an income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle royalty rates terminal growth rate contributory asset charges and customer attrition rate each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived intangible asset is charged to expense 

iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

due to a change in the timing and amount of projected cash flows associated with 140 million of acquired inprocess rd intangible assets from a historical acquisition we updated the estimated fair values of these assets in 2021 while no impairment has been recorded because the estimated fair values of those assets exceeded their carrying values the estimated excess of fair value over carrying value of these assets further declined in 2021 and are at risk of future impairment should the estimated timing or amount of projected cash flows further deteriorate 

in 2021 we changed the measurement date of our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests from december 31st to november 1st this change better aligns the timing of the impairment tests with our longterm business planning process the change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge 

certain regulatory matters 

the us food and drug administration fda commenced an inspection of claris’ facilities in ahmedabad india in july 2017 immediately prior to the closing of the claris acquisition fda completed the inspection and subsequently issued a warning letter based on observations identified in the 2017 inspection claris warning letter¹ due to challenges with the ongoing covid19 pandemic fda has not yet reinspected the facilities and management cannot speculate on when the claris warning letter will be lifted however we are continuing to implement corrective and preventive actions to address fda’s prior observations and other items we identified and management continues to pursue and implement other manufacturing locations including contract manufacturing organizations to support the production of new products for distribution in the us as previously disclosed we have secured alternative locations to produce a majority of the planned new products to be manufactured in ahmedabad for distribution into the us and are producing new products from those locations

baxter international inc was incorporated under delaware law in 1931 as used in this report “baxter international” means baxter international inc and “we our” or us means baxter international and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the separation and distribution of baxalta incorporated baxalta in 2015 as further described below unless the context otherwise requires 

covid19 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and we expect will continue to increase our expenses including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking these measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities in addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020 governments have closed borders imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic we expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business for further discussion refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

business segments and products 

we manage our business based on three geographic segments americas north and south america emea europe middle east and africa and apac asiapacific 

each of our segments provides a broad portfolio of essential healthcare products including acute and chronic dialysis therapies sterile iv solutions infusion systems and devices parenteral nutrition therapies inhaled anesthetics generic injectable pharmaceuticals and surgical hemostat and sealant products 

for financial information about our segments see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we have our own direct sales force and also make sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers in the united states third parties such as cardinal health inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of our products through their distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries as of december 31 2020 

international operations 

the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the united states and geographic expansion remains a component of our strategy our presence includes operations in europe the middle east africa asiapacific latin america and canada we are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states for more information on these risks see the information under the captions “risks related to baxter’s business —we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally” and “—changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

for financial information about our foreign and domestic revenues and geographic segment information see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

contractual arrangements 

our products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members we have purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases we face competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with us purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across our markets globally 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available we at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability we also seek to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to our overall raw materials procurement strategy 

we are not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces accordingly we utilize longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases 

in connection with the separation and distribution of baxalta in 2015 as further described below we entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with baxalta baxalta manufactures and supplies us with artiss tisseel floseal and standalone thrombin on a costplus basis under that manufacturing and supply agreement 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

our businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of our product offerings and our strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics gpos physicians and patients many of whom selfadminister homebased therapies that we supply we also benefit from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of our products 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that we and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients we face similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we own a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and have entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by us are sold primarily under our own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by us are sold under our trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by our suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to us we maintain certain details about our processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally require employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that our employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

our policy is to protect our products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for us we also recognize the need to promote the enforcement of our patents and trademarks and take commercially reasonable steps to enforce our patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

our investment in research and development rd consistent with our portfolio optimization and capital allocation strategies helps fuel our future growth and our ability to remain competitive in each of our product categories accordingly we continue to focus our investment on select rd programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation expenditures for our rd activities were 521 million in 2020 595 million in 2019 and 654 million in 2018 these expenditures include costs associated with rd activities performed at our rd centers located 

around the world which include facilities in belgium sweden india italy germany china japan and the united states as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for rd work performed at nonbaxter locations 

for more information on our rd activities refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “strategic objectives” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

quality management 

our continued success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements helping to prevent defects facilitating continuous improvement of our processes products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our quality system enables the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products to ensure that they conform to customer requirements in order to consistently improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our quality system various measurement monitoring and analysis methods such as management reviews and internal external and vendor audits are employed at local and central levels 

each product that we market is required to meet specific quality standards both in packaging and in product integrity and quality if any of those is determined to be compromised at any time we endeavor to take corrective and preventive actions designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet customer expectations for more information on corrective actions taken by us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

government regulation 

our operations and many of the products manufactured or sold by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the united states the food and drug administration fda in the united states the european medicines agency ema in europe the china food and drug administration cfda in china and other government agencies inside and outside of the united states administer requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling promotion and advertising distribution and postmarket surveillance of our products we must obtain specific approval from fda and nonus regulatory authorities before we can market and sell most of our products in a particular country even after we obtain regulatory approval to market a product the product and our manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by fda and other regulatory authorities globally including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain state agencies in the united states also regulate our facilities operations employees products and services within their respective states we along with our facilities are subject to periodic inspections and possible administrative and legal actions by fda and other regulatory agencies inside and outside the united states such actions may include warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses as situations require we take steps to ensure safety and efficacy of our products such as removing products found not to meet applicable requirements from the market and improving the effectiveness of quality systems for more information on compliance actions taken by us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the united states concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of products the operation of our facilities and distribution of products in the united states we are subject to the oversight of fda office of the inspector general within the department of health and human services oig the center for medicaremedicaid services cms the department of justice doj environmental protection agency department of defense and customs and border protection in addition to others we supply products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as medicare as a result our activities are subject to regulation by cms and enforcement by oig and doj in each jurisdiction outside the united states our activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the ema in europe cfda in china and other agencies in other jurisdictions many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years these actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally 

our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes our environmental policies require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection for example we made 10 million of capital expenditures in 2020 related to a new ethylene oxide emissions control system at our mountain home arkansas facility the new system is expected to be completed in 2022 and we currently expect to incur an additional 40 million of capital expenditures related to this project

human capital management 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 50000 people globally with approximately 13000 employees in the united states and approximately 37000 employees outside of the unites states our employees are our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives all of our employees contribute to our success and in particular the employees in our manufacturing sales rd and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program 

the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and develop a diverse population of talented and highperforming employees at all levels of our organization including the individuals who comprise our global workforce as well as executive officers and other key personnel to succeed in a competitive labor market we have developed recruitment and retention strategies objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business these strategies objectives and measures form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs policies and initiatives 

• competitive pay and benefits our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results the structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both shortterm and longterm performance 

• activating change today act building on our strong diversity and inclusion platform our senior leadership is working in close collaboration with the baxter black alliance business resource group and colleagues from across the company on a multidimensional program to advance inclusion and racial justice the act initiative is focused on driving results across four key areas – workforce workplace community and marketplace – encompassing employees external stakeholders and the markets and communities we serve 

• health and safety health and safety are firmly rooted across our global footprint in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we implemented changes in our business in 2020 in an effort to better protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for employees in our administrative functions while our essential workers production and field service employees have continued to work at our facilities and provide vital service to our customers most employees in our administrative functions have effectively 

worked remotely since midmarch during 2020 we paid incremental nonrecurring special compensation bonuses to our essential workers 

• recruitment training and development we use recruitment vehicles to attract diverse talent to our organization and we invest in learning opportunities that foster a growth mindset our formal offerings include a tuition reimbursement program an elearning platform known as baxu and virtual workshops that support our culture strategy and the development of crucial skills to measure the impact of the investments we make in our people and to help us consistently improve our human resources programs we regularly conduct anonymous surveys of our global workforce to seek feedback on a variety of topics including confidence in our leadership competitiveness of our compensation and benefits packages career growth opportunities and improvements on how we can make our company an employer of choice administered and analyzed by an independent thirdparty the survey results are reviewed by our senior leaders which include our executive officers the results of this engagement survey are also shared with individual managers who are then tasked with taking action based on their employees’ anonymous feedback both quantitative and qualitative by paying close attention to the results both at an aggregate enterprise level as well as at a departmentbusinesswork group level we have been able to enhance our culture of respect help educate employees more effectively about our benefits offerings as well as our learning and development opportunities and further improve our communications content mechanisms and frequency

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition results of operations future growth prospects and stock price could suffer 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have had and we expect will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses including the impact associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking these measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities in addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020 governments have closed borders imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic we expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business risks associated with covid19 include but are not limited to the following 

• we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers reprioritize the treatment of 

patients some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures and as hospital systems prioritize treatment of covid19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines many of those procedures have been suspended or postponed in our principal markets in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 this resulted in lower levels of general hospital admissions and elective surgery volumes in those markets which negatively impacted the demand for certain of our products it is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures if patients and hospital systems continue to deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures our business financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected 

• a significant number of our suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including with respect to the ability of their employees to get to their places of work and maintain the continuity of their onsite operations these impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability for example we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products as such materials are also being used to produce covid19 vaccines 

• we could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments reduced demand or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues these liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services 

• covid19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations including members of our management as well as the ability of our suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors to retain their key employees to the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by covid19 and are not available to perform their professional duties we could experience delays in or the suspension of our manufacturing operations research and development activities and other functions 

• we face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety including through office closures and work from home policies for example remote working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks including cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breaches and telecommunication failures both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and thirdparty developers rely on to work remotely any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm these risks are particularly heightened due to covid‑19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruptions caused by the uncertain environment 

• covid19 and related impacts have affected and may further affect the global economy and capital markets worldwide which among other consequences may restrict our access to capital increase financing costs adversely affect our liquidity the perceptions of our creditworthiness and our ability to complete acquisitions and increase volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be predicted at this time such as the severity and duration of the pandemic including of related resurgences and future mutations or outbreaks of related strains of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment efforts including the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines for covid19 and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees customers counterparties service providers and regulators as well as other market participants any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations finally to the extent covid19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section may be heightened 

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the rd process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer 

issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products among other negative consequences 

our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products the pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels these levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement seasonality natural disasters pandemics epidemics and other matters for example as hospital systems prioritized treatment of covid19 patients elective medical procedures were suspended or postponed in our principal markets which negatively impacted demand for certain products additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive as a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices record asset impairment charges or take other actions which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products while we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products new or unintended uses of our product for example in response to covid19 or changing clinical practice may also raise quality or safety issues a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls either voluntary or required by fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a thirdparty supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation 

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our business financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable our sales could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

in addition many health care industry companies including health care systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful we may not realize the intended benefits 

we expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of our resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess rd projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes 

for more information on recent business development activities see note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing information technology and rd positions competition for top talent in the 

healthcare industry can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

risks related to our business operations 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or if we experience other manufacturing sterilization supply or distribution difficulties our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires among other things the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from ourselves for selfsupplied requirements we endeavor either alone or working closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified for most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective a reduction or interruption in supply an issue in the supply chain including issues due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture distribute and sell our products in a timely or costeffective manner moreover changes in regulation world trade policies international taxes and governmenttogovernment relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” additionally volatility in our costs of energy transportationfreight components raw materials and other supply manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations climate change including laws or regulations passed in response thereto could increase our costs in particular our costs of supply energy and transportationfreight material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products as well as our transportationfreight costs these outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site loss or damage to or closure of a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster such as we experienced as a result of hurricane maria a pandemic such as covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences including those identified in the paragraphs above in addition several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution and we utilize both baxterowned and thirdparty facilities for this process if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure whether temporarily or permanent of one or more of these facilities we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all and a third party may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace sterilization capacity 

for example in february 2020 certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization equipment at our facility in mountain home arkansas was tested and determined not to operate in accordance with applicable emission limitations in our stateissued air permit although we received a temporary variance and have recommenced operations these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience whether due to lack of capacity environmental regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise could result in product shortage unanticipated costs loss of revenues litigation and damage to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data including from cyber security breaches and data leakage could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation and competitive position 

we rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure including support provided by our partners and third parties to support our business our products and our customers for example we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection use storage and transfer disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential business financial personal patient and other sensitive information collectively confidential information we also rely on systems for manufacturing customer orders shipping regulatory compliance and various other matters certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes some of our products even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems connect to hospital networks electronic medical records or electronic health records the continuing evolution of technology we use including cloudbased computing and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional intentional andor unauthorized exposure dissemination andor destruction of confidential information stored in our devices systems servers infrastructure and products collectively technology security threats including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated frequent and adaptive 

our technology is vulnerable to breakdown interruption cyber and other security attacks system malfunction unauthorized access inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information theft and other events thirdparty systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems any such vulnerability could compromise our technology and could expose confidential information to unauthorized third parties andor cause permanent loss of such data in addition to loss of confidential information unauthorized access to or interference with our technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety field actions andor product recalls we have like other large multinational companies experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns attacks breaches in our technology cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that host or process confidential information on our behalf such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other confidential information and could pose a risk to patient safety any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties business disruption reputational harm financial loss litigation as well as other damages misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs see “—risks related to legal and regulatory matters” as the fda other regulators and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness we could also suffer strained relationships with customers business partners physicians and other healthcare professionals increased costs for security measures remediation or otherwise litigation including class actions and stockholder derivative actions or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price from breaches cyber and other security attacks industrial espionage ransomware email or phishing scams malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners 

in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities further a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic and related government actions which among other things could 

expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems we also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation tariffs export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability monetary or currency volatility or instability including as it relates to the us dollar the euro the yuan and currencies in emerging market countries disputes between countries trade relationships and conflicts diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including natural disaster pandemic power loss cyberattack data breach war terrorism riot labor disruption civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk formally left the european union eu commonly known as brexit when the ukeu withdrawal agreement became effective under the withdrawal agreement a transition period began that ran until december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 the uk left the eu single market and customs union as well as all eu policies and international agreements as a result the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the uk and the eu ended and the eu and the uk formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces on december 24 2020 the european commission reached a trade agreement with the uk on the terms of its future cooperation with the eu trade agreement the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and the eu will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously the withdrawal by the uk from the eu could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates and increased regulatory complexities as well as the potential for product shortages increased costs or other similar effects these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the us and china could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by both countries through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions tariff exclusions awarded to us by the us government require annual renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to the markets 

more generally several governments including the us have raised the possibility of policies to induce “reshoring” of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production one example would be the stronger “buy american” requirements in the us pursuant to a us executive order by the new administration on january 25 2021 or us withdrawal from the world trade organization agreement on government procurement gpa if such steps triggered retaliation in other markets such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

we are subject to a number of laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to 

the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities the same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new european union medical device regulation when it enters into force in may 2021 changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions reputational damage injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur that we will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect our operations and consolidated financial statements 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the sec have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion pricing sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the sunshine act enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the ppaca can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly 

we are also subject to environmental laws which are becoming more stringent throughout the world for example the epa regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices as is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers or result in liability to us the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

additionally the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign control and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries or with governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions from time to time 

certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions including iran sudan syria russia and cuba these dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change additional restrictions may be enacted enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations 

we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to our ongoing government investigations please refer to note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us including qualityrelated matters refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability 

as a global company we are subject to global data privacy and security laws regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data in the united states and in other countries including but not limited to the health insurance portability and accountability act as amended hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the california consumer privacy act ccpa and the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr the gdpr imposes stringent european union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance hipaa also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures we or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation 

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or in foreign countries including through the implementation or repeal of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers these payers include medicare medicaid and private healthcare insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the united states our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies including government reporting and auditing additional regulatory oversight mandated contractual terms failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements 

public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies which are lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products 

the ppaca includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure certain portions of the ppaca could negatively impact the demand for our products and therefore our results of operations and financial position 

there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the ppaca through legislative action and legal challenges and the most recent challenge is currently before the us supreme court recent changes to the composition of the supreme court may increase the likelihood that the ppaca is repealed or impacted in some manner in the event the ppaca is repealed or significantly altered it would impact our business in a number of ways some of which may be material 

following a 2019 executive order from former president donald trump the us department of health and human services announced the launch of a new kidney health initiative the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms published the final end stage renal disease treatment choices mandatory payment model etc on september 18 2020 the etc launched in 30 of dialysis clinics across the country on january 1 2021 and creates payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those already on dialysis cms also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with latestage chronic kidney disease and esrd cms has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation these voluntary payment models have a scheduled commencement date of april 2021 but applicants now have the option to delay implementation until january 2022 these proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the us end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products necessitating significant multiyear capital expenditures in order to meet that demand however the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance 

in addition a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement and any disruptions in federal government operations including a federal government shutdown or failure of the us government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties an unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public 

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property confidential information and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

changes to the tax laws in the united states or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results in particular the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively 2017 tax act including among other things certain changes in tax rates deductibility of interest deductibility of executive compensation expense expensing of capital expenditures the ability to use certain tax credits taxation on earnings from international business operations and the treatment of deductible payments made by our us affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in certain instances the 2017 tax act could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of tax balances any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance there remains some uncertainty regarding aspects of the implementation of the 2017 tax act that could potentially have adverse impacts on us we cannot currently predict the full impact that the 2017 tax act may have over time on our business including revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for more information regarding the impact of the 2017 tax act see note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k similarly the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the organization of economic cooperation and development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions which could adversely impact our global tax obligations 

taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities our tax liabilities are affected by many factors including the amounts we charge in intracompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate although we believe that we transact intracompany business in accordance with armslength principles tax authorities may disagree with our intracompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 annual report on form 10k 

we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits settlement discussions mediations arbitrations and other disputes in addition in the future we may be party to such disputes including patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation and other disputes including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

we identified certain misstatements to our previously issued financial statements and have restated the financial statements described below the “restatement” which has exposed us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties 

as discussed in the explanatory note in note 2 restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements and in note 19 quarterly financial data unaudited in our 2019 annual report on form 10k we restated certain of our previously issued audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and selected financial information to correct misstatements of certain foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency denominated intracompany loan receivables and payables cash balances and gains and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts which we determined were material to these periods 

as a result of the misstatements and the restatement we have become subject to additional risks and uncertainties and costs including as a result of a pending classaction lawsuit and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records as initially disclosed on october 24 2019 we also voluntarily advised the staff of the sec of our previously disclosed internal investigation and we are continuing to cooperate with the staff of the sec we may become subject to enforcement proceedings brought by the sec or other regulatory or governmental authorities or subject to other legal proceedings as a result of the events leading to our internal investigation the misstatements or the related restatement and actions and proceedings could also be brought against our current and former employees officers or directors these actions lawsuits or other legal proceedings related to the misstatements or the restatement could result in reputational harm additional defense and other costs regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit or proceeding if we do not prevail in any such lawsuit or proceeding we could be subject to substantial damages or settlement costs criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement civil and criminal fines and penalties in addition we continue to be at risk for loss of investor confidence loss of key employees changes in management or our board of directors and other reputational issues all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to the economy and our financial performance 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the us dollar euro or yuan 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors including in emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section these fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price 

we may not achieve our financial goals 

we continue to evaluate and refine both our shortterm and longterm financial objectives these include for example our stated objective to improve our gross margin our strategy to achieve these objectives is focused on strengthening our portfolio and extending our impact through transformative innovation that spans prevention to recovery as part of this strategy we intend to invest in portfolio innovation and market development and entering adjacencies while continuing to drive operational excellence through ongoing business transformation efforts and organization optimization we will also look to unlock additional value through strategic capital deployment we may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future material impairments in the value of our longlived assets including goodwill could negatively affect our operating results 

we regularly review our longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets goodwill which results from our acquisition activity and property plant and equipment for impairment goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future in addition we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy including in connection with strategic exits future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations for more information on the valuation and impairment of longlived assets refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “critical accounting policies” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any retained shares transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions collectively the baxter transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to baxter and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the baxter transactions although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from kpmg llp regarding certain aspects of the baxalta separation not covered by the irs private letter ruling the opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by baxter and baxalta if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the baxter transactions the opinion or irs private letter ruling may not be valid moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the irs 

if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the code 

in anticipation of the merger between baxalta and shire the merger we entered into a letter agreement with shire and baxalta the letter agreement under the letter agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify and shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the letter agreement if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the baxter transactions baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities although baxalta and shire may be required to indemnify baxter under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from baxalta or the guarantee thereof by shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either baxalta or shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations 

even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from baxalta or shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to bear these costs initially which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

our global product portfolio optimization strategy identifies products that we believe to have characteristics of core growth products that we expect to provide us with a core return on capital products that we intend to maintain or manage differently and products that we consider to be strategic bets for products with core growth characteristics we look to invest for longterm higher margin growth for products that we expect to generate a core return on capital we seek to optimize our return on investment and to maintain or enhance our market position for products that we intend to maintain or manage differently we look to sustain or reposition our underlying investment finally we are evaluating our market position and investment strategy for products that we consider to be strategic bets 

as part of our portfolio management strategy we seek to optimize our position in product areas where we have a stable profitable business model identify and alter investments in products that have reached the end of their life 

cycles or for which market positions have evolved unfavorably in the course of doing so we expect to continue to reallocate capital to more promising opportunities or business groupings as described above 

as part of this strategy we are shifting our investments to drive innovation in product areas where we have compelling opportunities to serve patients and healthcare professionals while advancing our business and we are accelerating the pace in which we bring these advances to market we are in the midst of launching several new products geographic expansions and line extensions by 2023 including in such areas as chronic and acute renal care smart pump technology hospital pharmaceuticals and nutritionals surgical sealants and more these comprise a mix of entirely new offerings improvements on existing technologies and the expansion of current products into new geographies 

operational excellence

maintaining disciplined and balanced capital allocation 

our capital allocation strategies include the following 

• reinvest in the business by funding opportunities that are positioned to deliver sustainable growth support our innovation efforts and improve margin performance 

• return capital to stockholders through dividends which we expect to meaningfully increase with earnings growth

net sales   



net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 3 at actual and constant currency rates net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 2 at actual rates and 5 at constant currency rates 

foreign currency exchange rates had no net impact on 2020 net sales growth foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted 2019 net sales growth by three percentage points principally due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro australian dollar british pound chinese yuan and colombian peso 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect current year local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period we believe that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the us gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding and facilitate a fuller analysis of our results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

in 2020 the acquisition of seprafilm contributed 94 million in revenue in 2020 and 2019 the acquisition of cheetah had an insignificant impact on reported revenues the recothrom and preveleak products acquired in 2018 contributed 80 million and 52 million of revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the covid19 pandemic covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and we expect will continue to increase our expenses including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking these measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities in addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 

2020 governments have closed borders imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic we expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business for further discussion refer to the global business unit net sales reporting section below and item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the difference between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to favorable geographic earnings mix and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 the difference between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory rate was primarily due to special items the most significant of which was the impact of recently enacted tax reform in switzerland and india we recognized a deferred tax benefit of 90 million to reflect a tax basis stepup net of a valuation allowance partially offset by a 5 million deferred tax revaluation to reflect an increase in the statutory tax rate under the newly enacted swiss tax laws we also recognized a net deferred tax benefit of 24 million associated with deferred tax revaluation in india to reflect a decrease in the statutory tax rate 

in addition to the swiss and indian tax reform impacts our effective rate in 2019 was different from the us federal statutory rate due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with a favorable tax ruling a benefit related to a notional interest deduction on the share capital of a foreign subsidiary and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 the difference between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory rate was primarily due to special items the most significant of which was our finalization of our provisional adjustments resulting from the 2017 tax act sec staff accounting bulletin 118 sab 118 allowed a oneyear measurement period from the december 22 2017 tax act enactment date to refine the provisional amounts recognized in the 2017 financial statements

americas 

segment operating income was 22 billion 24 billion and 24 billion in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by decreased sales and gross margin in multiple gbus particularly medication delivery pharmaceuticals and advanced surgery and lower gross profit as a result of an unfavorable product mix and incremental logistics costs due primarily to the impact of the covid19 pandemic the decreases 

were partially offset by favorable performance in acute therapies and clinical nutrition as well as the acquisition of seprafilm the decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by lower sales and gross margin in pharmaceuticals and lower us incenter hd sales partially offset by favorable performance in medication delivery and advanced surgery primarily due to a temporary supply disruption of a competitor additionally results in 2019 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates

cash flows from operations — continuing operations 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 cash provided by operating activities was 19 billion 21 billion and 20 billion respectively operating cash flows decreased in 2020 primarily due to payments of 173 million to settle interest rate derivative contracts in 2020 an increase in inventory levels in 2020 and insurance recoveries received in 2019 from a legacy productrelated matter and hurricane maria partially offset by the timing of vendor payments and lower restructuring and employee incentive compensation payments in 2020 operating cash flows increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in our operating income which included the insurance recoveries related to hurricane maria and a legacy productrelated matter

in 2020 cash used for investing activities included payments for acquisitions of 494 million primarily related to seprafilm and multiple product acquisitions and capital expenditures of 709 million in 2019 cash used for investing activities included payments for acquisitions of 418 million primarily related to cheetah and multiple product acquisitions and capital expenditures of 696 million in 2018 cash used in investing activities included 

payments for acquisitions of 268 million primarily related to recothrom and preveleak and multiple product acquisitions and capital expenditures of 659 million 

we expect that our capital expenditures will increase in 2021 as we make investments in our manufacturing capacity in response to proposed regulatory changes of the us department of health and human services in kidney health policy and reimbursement which may substantially change the us end stage renal disease market and demand for our peritoneal dialysis products 

in february 2021 we agreed to acquire the rights to transderm scop from subsidiaries of glaxosmithkline for an upfront purchase price of 55 million plus the cost of acquired inventory and the potential for additional cash consideration of 30 million based upon a successful technology transfer by a specified date we expect the transaction to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2021 subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions 

in december 2020 we agreed to acquire the rights to caelyx and doxil the branded versions of liposomal doxorubicin from a subsidiary of johnson  johnson for specified territories outside of the us for 325 million we expect the transaction to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2021 subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 

refer to note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our significant acquisitions and other arrangements 

cash flows from financing activities 

in 2020 cash generated from financing activities included 12 billion of net proceeds from the march 2020 issuance of 750 million of senior notes due in 2025 and 500 million of senior notes due in 2030 in november 2020 we issued 650 million of senior notes due in 2031 and used the proceeds along with cash on hand to redeem the 750 million senior notes due in 2025 that were issued in march 2020 for 854 million which included a 104 million makewhole premium we have used the net proceeds from the senior notes issuances and redemptions for general corporate purposes including to strengthen our balance sheet as a precautionary measure in light of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 we also repaid 322 million of variable rate notes that matured and the borrowings under our eurodenominated credit facility of €200 million 225 million financing activities in 2020 also included payments for stock repurchases of 500 million dividend payments of 473 million and receipts from stock issued under employee benefit plans of 202 million 

in 2019 cash generated from financing activities included 17 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of €750 million of senior notes due in 2024 and €750 million of senior notes due in 2029 €200 million 222 million of borrowings under our eurodenominated credit facility and stock issued under employee benefit plans of 356 million partially offset by payments for stock repurchases of 13 billion and dividend payments of 423 million in 2018 cash used for financing activities included payments for stock repurchases of 25 billion and dividend payments of 376 million partially offset by the proceeds from stock issued under employee benefit plans of 258 million 

as authorized by the board of directors we repurchase our stock depending upon our cash flows net debt levels and market conditions in july 2012 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our common stock the board of directors increased this authority by an additional 15 billion in each of november 2016 and february 2018 by an additional 20 billion in november 2018 and by an additional 15 billion in october 2020 we paid 500 million in cash to repurchase approximately 63 million shares under this authority pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan in 2020 and had 19 billion remaining available under this authorization as of december 31 2020 

in december 2018 we entered into a 300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement asr agreement with an investment bank we funded the asr agreement with available cash under the asr agreement we received 36 million shares upon execution based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr agreement we received an additional 06 million shares from the investment bank at settlement in may 2019 

credit facilities and access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2020 our us dollardenominated revolving credit facility had capacity of 20 billion as of december 31 2020 our eurodenominated revolving credit facility had a capacity of approximately €200 million each of the facilities matures in 2024 there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31 2020 there was no amount outstanding under our us dollardenominated credit facility as of december 31 2019 and €200 million 224 million was outstanding at a 091 interest rate under our eurodenominated credit facility as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by the institution’s respective commitment 

we also maintain other credit arrangements as described in note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

access to capital and credit ratings 

we intend to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand and future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt we had 37 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2020 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate we invest our excess cash in money market and other funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 62 billion of longterm debt and finance lease obligations including current maturities subject to market conditions we regularly evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure 

our ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt including commercial paper or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however we believe we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives 

our credit ratings at december 31 2020 were as follows 



libor reform 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the london interbank offered rate libor and other interbank offered rates which have been widely used as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts including loans debt and derivatives this announcement indicated that the continuation of libor on the current basis was not guaranteed after 2021 regulators in the us and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr in 2020 it was announced that certain us dollar libor tenors would not cease until 2023 currently our credit facilities reference liborbased rates the discontinuation of libor will require these arrangements to be modified in order to replace libor with an alternative reference interest rate which could impact our cost of funds our credit facilities include a provision specifying that we and the lenders will negotiate in good faith for the determination of a successor libor rate 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities payable or maturing in the following periods 



  

1 interest payments on debt and finance lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2020 certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2020 refer to note 5 and note 6 respectively in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion regarding our debt instruments outstanding and finance lease obligations at december 31 2020 

2 the primary components of other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 are pension and other postretirement benefits deferred tax liabilities longterm tax liabilities and litigation and environmental reserves we projected the timing of the related future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates where applicable and estimates of the timing of payments for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates the actual timing of payments could differ from our estimates 

we contributed 74 million 69 million and 51 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the timing of funding in future periods is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes cash outflows related to our pension plans the amount included within other noncurrent liabilities and excluded from the table above related to our pension plan liabilities was 10 billion as of december 31 2020 in 2021 we have no obligation to fund our principal plans in the united states and we expect to make contributions of at least 45 million to our foreign pension plans additionally we have excluded longterm tax liabilities which include liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax liabilities from the table above because we are unable to estimate the timing of the related cash outflows the amounts of longterm tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities included within other noncurrent liabilities and excluded from the table above were 84 million and 143 million respectively as of december 31 2020 

3 includes our significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations for cancellable agreements any penalty due upon cancellation is included these commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business examples include firm commitments for raw material purchases utility agreements and service contracts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we periodically enter into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties we may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of our significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 14 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding receivable transactions and note 2 and note 7 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements indemnifications and legal contingencies 

financial instrument market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates our hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on our judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 14 and note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our financial instruments and hedging strategies 

currency risk 

we are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese yuan korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen colombian peso brazilian real mexican peso indian rupee and swedish krona we manage our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows us to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition we use derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange however we dont hedge our entire foreign exchange exposure and are still subject to earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange risk financial market and currency volatility may limit our ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

we use options and forwards to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the maximum term over which we have cash flow hedge contracts in place related to foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions as of december 31 2020 is 12 months we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk on certain intracompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 

as part of our riskmanagement program we perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of our foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2020 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies the net pretax liability balance of 8 million with respect to those contracts would increase by 32 million resulting in a net asset position a similar analysis performed with respect to contracts outstanding as of december 31 2019 indicated that on a pretax basis the net asset balance of 9 million would decrease by 18 million resulting in a net liability position 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2020 by replacing the actual exchange rates as of december 31 2020 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting effective july 1 2018 changes in the value of the argentine peso applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset positions are recorded in income at the time of the change as of december 31 2020 our net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos are not significant 

interest rate risk 

we are also exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates our policy is to manage interest costs using the mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that we believe is appropriate at that time to manage this mix in a costefficient manner we periodically enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount we also periodically use forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt as of december 31 2020 all of our outstanding debt obligations were at fixed interest rates and no interest rate derivative instruments were outstanding 

changes in accounting standards 

refer to note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on changes in accounting standards 

recent accounting pronouncements 

there are no accounting standards issued but not yet effective that we believe will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as these policies are the most important to the depiction of our financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by us often employing the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from our estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our results of operations and financial position the following is a summary of accounting policies that we consider critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price transaction price which includes estimates of variable consideration primarily related to rebates and wholesaler chargebacks these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales our estimates take into consideration historical experience current contractual and statutory requirements specific known market events and trends industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns overall these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract the amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period additionally our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determining the allocation of the transaction price may require significant judgment 

pension and opeb plans 

we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees the service component of employee benefit expenses is reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statements as the applicable employee’s compensation expense all other components of these employee benefit expenses are reported in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

• interest rates used to discount pension and opeb plan liabilities 

• the longterm rate of return on pension plan assets 

• rates of increases in employee compensation used in estimating liabilities 

• anticipated future healthcare trend rates used in estimating the opeb plan liability and 

• other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover used in estimating liabilities 

selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results 

our key assumptions are listed in note 11 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2020 measurement date we utilized discount rates of 273 and 233 to measure our benefit obligations for the us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively we used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2020 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds we would most likely select if we were to actually annuitize our pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and other european countries we use a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for our other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost we perform a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 25 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 30 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2020 we used a longterm expected rate of return of 65 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will decrease to 55 in 2021 this assumption is not applicable to our opeb plan because it is not funded 

we establish the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on our asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both our actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost we perform a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 15 million 

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans we used the pri2012 combined mortality table with improvements projected using the mp2019 projection scale adjusted to a longterm improvement of 08 as of december 31 2020 for all other pension plans we utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations we periodically analyze and update our assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax reform 

we maintain valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history 

expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business we are audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and are periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities we prevail in positions for which reserves have been established or we are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we updated our accounting for the initial impact of the 2017 tax act in 2018 in accordance with the guidance in sab 118 refer to note 12 within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

we record acquired intangible assets at fair value in business combinations and at cost in asset acquisitions valuations are generally completed for intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived intangible asset is charged to expense 

iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

due to a change in the timing and amount of projected cash flows associated with 140 million of acquired inprocess rd intangible assets from a historical acquisition we updated the estimated fair values of these assets in 2020 while no impairment has been recorded because the estimated fair values of those assets exceeded their carrying values the estimated excess of fair value over carrying value of these assets declined in 2020 and are at risk of future impairment should the estimated timing or amount of projected cash flows further deteriorate 

certain regulatory matters 

the us food and drug administration fda commenced an inspection of claris’ facilities in ahmedabad india in july 2017 immediately prior to the closing of the claris acquisition fda completed the inspection and subsequently issued a warning letter based on observations identified in the 2017 inspection claris warning letter¹ fda has not yet reinspected the facilities and management cannot speculate on when the claris warning letter will be lifted however we are continuing to implement corrective and preventive actions to address fda’s prior observations and other items we identified and management continues to pursue and implement other manufacturing locations including contract manufacturing organizations to support the production of new products for distribution in the us as of december 31 2020  we have secured alternative locations to produce a majority of the planned new products to be manufactured in ahmedabad for distribution into the us 

on may 6 2019 we received a show cause notice under the drugs  cosmetics act 1940 and rules thereunder show cause notice from the commissioner of the food  drugs control administration in the gujarat state in gandhinagar india commissioner the show cause notice was issued regarding an april 9 2019 inspection of our claris facilities in ahmedabad india by the commissioner the show cause notice contained a number of observations of alleged good manufacturing practice related issues across a variety of areas some of which overlap with the areas covered in the claris warning letter we responded to the show cause notice and a follow up inspection occurred in july 2019 this matter resulted in a twoday suspension order for certain manufacturing operations which occurred on march 19 and 20 2020 this matter is now closed

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2020 based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2020 

remediation of material weakness 

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 we identified a material weakness over the accounting for certain foreign exchange gains and losses specifically we did not have controls in place to m onitor and quantify the difference between the foreign exchange gains and losses that we reported and the foreign exchange gains and losses that we would have reported using exchange rates determined in accordance with us gaap additionally our policies and controls related to approvals and monitoring of intracompany transactions were insufficient to prevent or detect intracompany transactions undertaken solely for the purpose of generating foreign exchange gains or avoiding losses under our historical exchange rate convention this material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

due to the actions taken by us to implement new controls and procedures management has concluded that this material weakness has been remediated as of december 31 2020 the actions we took to remediate the material weakness were as follows 

• exchange rate policy – we discontinued the use of our historical exchange rate convention and are using the exchange rates determined in accordance with us gaap for purposes of measuring foreign currency transactions and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

• automated feed – we implemented an automated feed that extracts foreign exchange rates on a daily basis from a recognized thirdparty exchange rate source 

• daily rate comparison – we implemented a daily rate comparison control that extracts foreign exchange rates from a a thirdparty exchange rate source b our treasury application and c our enterprise resource planning erp system and compares those rates in order to identify any potential differences and provide assurance that the correct rates were captured and are being used in our financial systems 

• intracompany transaction approvals – we updated our policies to require additional approvals of intracompany transactions and implemented a requirement that such transactions be supported by a documented business purpose 

• personnel  we made personnel changes including hiring a new treasurer from outside baxter with more than thirty years of treasury experience and responsibility including at four publicly traded companies we have also hired another experienced treasury professional in a newly created director role responsible for treasury governance and controls additionally we created a treasury controller role within our accounting function and are continuing to add resources as appropriate to improve our financial reporting controls related to treasury activities 

we and our board of directors are committed to maintaining a strong control environment and we believe that these remediation efforts represent significant improvements in our controls we monitored the related processes and controls throughout the remediation period and have concluded that they are operating effectively 

management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate 

management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 in making this assessment management used the framework in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that assessment under the framework in internal controlintegrated framework 2013  management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein

contractual arrangements 

the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally

raw materials

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces

in connection with the separation and distribution of baxalta baxter entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with baxalta baxalta manufactures and supplies baxter with artiss tisseel floseal and standalone thrombin under the manufacturing and supply agreement on a costplus basis

competition and healthcare cost containment

baxter’s businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of their product offerings as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics gpos physicians and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to 

 

patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements these agreements may be breached and baxter may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition baxter’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that baxter’s employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition results of operations future growth prospects and stock price could suffer

we may not achieve our longterm financial improvement goals

we have been implementing plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders these plans include the achievement of certain financial goals in 2019 and beyond while we are continuing to refine these goals our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our longrange plan which runs through 2023 we have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets these strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally driving operational excellence through the realignment of our cost structure and various restructuring activities and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital

as part of these strategies we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market we are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety future divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results including return on investment and synergies and may not provide the desired market access the restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business as a result we may not achieve our targeted financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the rd process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer

issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business subject us to regulatory actions or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products among other negative consequences

our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products the pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels these levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement seasonality natural disasters epidemics and other matters additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive as a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices record asset impairment charges or take other actions which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

additionally quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our 

 

products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or o fficial action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls either voluntary or required by fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of produc ts civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business and results of operations may be adversely affected

the manufacture of our products requires among other things the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from ourselves for selfsupplied requirements we endeavor either alone or working closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified for most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales additionally volatility in our costs of energy transportationfreight components raw materials and other supply manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations climate change including laws or regulations passed in response thereto could increase our costs in particular our costs of supply energy and transportationfreight material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products as well as our transportationfreight costs these outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above

some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster such as we experienced as a result of hurricane maria or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences including those identified in the paragraph above because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise

 

we are increasingly dependent on information techn ology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage 

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure including support provided by our partners and third parties to support our business our products and our customers for example we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection use storage and transfer disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential business financial personal and other sensitive information collectively confidential information we also rely on systems for manufacturing customer orders shipping regulatory compliance and various other matters certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes

additionally the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data including but not limited to the health insurance portability and accountability act the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the california consumer privacy act of 2018 and the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr in may 2018 the gdpr superseded current european union data protection legislation imposed more stringent european union data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance we or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation 

the increasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional intentional andor unauthorized exposure dissemination andor destruction of confidential information stored in our devices systems servers infrastructure and products collectively technology security threats including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated frequent and adaptive our technology and that of third parties that we use is vulnerable to breakdown interruption cyber and other security attacks system malfunction unauthorized access inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information theft and other events any such vulnerability could compromise our technology and could expose confidential information to unauthorized third parties andor cause permanent loss of such data in addition to loss of confidential information unauthorized access to or interference with our technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety field actions andor product recalls while we have invested in the protection of data and technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns attacks breaches in our technology cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to third party service providers that host or process confidential information on our behalf such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties business disruption reputational harm financial loss as well as other damages misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs we could also suffer strained relationships with customers and business partners increased costs for security measures remediation or otherwise litigation including class actions and stockholder derivative actions or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price from breaches cyber and other security attacks industrial espionage ransomware email or phishing scams malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners 

in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities we also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities the same testing and procedures sometimes apply to 

 

current products that are up for authorization renewal or are subject to changes in law or regulation for example certain of our medical devices will have to co mply with the new european union medical device regulation changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in ou r adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions reputational damage injunctions to halt the manufacture an d distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10 k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur that we will not face civil claims for damages f rom purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect ou r operations and consolidated financial statements 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion pricing sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the sunshine act enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the ppaca can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly 

additionally the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign control and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries or with governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions including iran sudan syria russia and cuba these dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions or the risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change additional restrictions may be enacted enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations

we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to our ongoing government investigations please refer to note 17 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

if re imbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or in foreign countries including through the implementation or repeal of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost con tainment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers these payers include medicare medicaid and private healthcare insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the united states our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies including government reporting and auditing additional regulatory oversight mandated contractual terms failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements

 

public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies which are lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products

the ppaca includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure certain portions of the ppaca could negatively impact the demand for our products and therefore our results of operations and financial position 

it is uncertain what impact the current us presidential administration might have on coverage reimbursement and other matters related to the ppaca andor healthcare reform in general including the timing and speed of any such impact in addition a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement and any disruptions in federal government operations including a federal government shutdown or failure of the us government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our business financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable our sales 

 

could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

in addition many health care industry companies including health care systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

if our business development activities are unsuccessful we may not realize the intended benefits

we expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of our resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess rd projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes

for more information on recent business development activities see note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties an unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property confidential information and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations

 

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and ma y cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa the united kingdom bribery act gdpr and other data privacy laws dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability monetary or currency volatility or instability including as it relates to the us dollar the euro the yuan and currencies in emerging market countries disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including natural disaster pandemic power loss cyber attack data breach war terrorism riot labor disruption civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

the 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union eu commonly known as brexit and the uk government’s subsequent initiation of the withdrawal process has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the eu the potential withdrawal by the uk from the eu particularly if such withdrawal occurs without a transitional agreement between the uk and the eu could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates and increased regulatory complexities as well as the potential for product shortages increased costs or other similar effects these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors including in emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results

changes to the tax laws in the united states or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results in particular the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively tax reform including among other things certain changes in tax rates deductibility of interest deductibility of executive compensation expense expensing of capital expenditures the ability to use certain tax credits taxation on earnings from international business operations and the treatment of deductible payments made by our us affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in certain instances tax reform could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of deferred tax balances any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance there remains some uncertainty regarding the implementation of such tax reform and its impact on us we cannot currently predict the full impact that tax reform may have over time on our business including revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for more information regarding the impact of tax reform see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities our tax liabilities are affected by many factors including the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with armslength principles tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result

we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and rd positions competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits settlement discussions mediations arbitrations and other disputes in addition in the future we may be party to such disputes including patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation and other disputes including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 17 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate

 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section these fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price

 

future material impairments in the value of our longlived assets including goodwill could negatively affect our operating results

 

we regularly review our longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets goodwill which results from our acquisition activity and property plant and equipment for impairment goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future in addition we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy including in connection with certain strategic exits future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations for more information on the valuation and impairment of longlived assets refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “critical accounting policies” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition

our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2018 our net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 130 million while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the us dollar euro or yuan for more information on accounts receivable 

 

and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the di scussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of baxalta

on july 1 2015 we distributed approximately 805 of the outstanding shares of baxalta common stock to baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business we disposed of our remaining 195 stake in baxalta retained shares in 2016 in connection with a series of transactions including debtforequity exchanges an equityforequity exchange and a contribution to our us pension plan retained shares transactions shire plc shire acquired baxalta in june 2016 after completion of the last retained shares transaction and in january 2019 takeda pharmaceutical company limited takeda acquired shire in connection with the july 2015 distribution we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a tax matters agreement a long term services agreement a manufacturing and supply agreement a trademark license agreement a galaxy license agreement an international commercial operations agreement and certain other commercial agreements with baxalta these agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward including with respect to potential taxrelated losses associated with the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us

the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation in addition the separation and distribution agreement provides for certain indemnification obligations of baxter which may be significant it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to baxalta third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and we may be unsuccessful in obtaining indemnification or the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations

the separation and distribution of baxalta continues to involve a number of risks including among other things the indemnification risks described above certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time takeda may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to baxalta under these agreements if baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations 

there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any retained shares transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future

the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions collectively the baxter transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to baxter and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the baxter transactions although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from kpmg llp regarding certain aspects of the baxalta separation not covered by the irs private letter ruling the opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by baxter and baxalta if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the baxter transactions the opinion or irs private letter ruling may not be valid moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the irs

if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the code

 

in anticipation of the merger between baxalta and shire the merger we enter ed into a letter agreement with shire and baxalta the letter agreement under the letter agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify and shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers dir ectors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the letter agreement if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in par t of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the baxter transactions baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities although baxalta and shire may be re quired to indemnify baxter under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from baxalta or the guarantee thereof by shire will be sufficient to protect u s against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either baxalta or shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations 

even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from baxalta or shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to bear these costs initially which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

the company’s provision for income taxes and its effective rate decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to special items the most significant of which was the company’s finalization of its provisional adjustments resulting from the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act sec staff accounting bulletin 118 sab 118 allowed a oneyear measurement period from the december 22 2017 tax act enactment date to refine the provisional amounts recognized in the 2017 financial statements 

the company recorded several sab 118 measurement period provisional adjustments in 2018 first after further studying the 2017 tax act and associated us treasury department proposed regulations the company refined its provisional estimate of a full valuation allowance against its us foreign tax credit deferred tax assets dtas and released a 194 million valuation allowance due to the company’s ability to utilize a portion of its us foreign tax credits dtas second t he 2017 tax act requires the company to pay us income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings in 2017 the company recognized a provisional charge for its onetime transitional tax expense of 529 million the majority of which was noncash during 2018 the company refined its estimated onetime transition tax expense recognizing a benefit of 5 million third t he 2017 tax act lowered the us federal rate from 35 to 21 and generally exempts foreign income from us taxation the company finalized its provisional revaluation of us deferred tax assets recording an additional 8 million benefit

in addition to the 2017 tax act sab 118 measurement period adjustments the company’s provision for income taxes and its effective rate decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a settlement of a 2008 through 2010 transfer pricing competent authority proceeding between the us and germany the reversal of a foreign valuation allowance as a result of continued profit improvements and the receipt of tax free income from the settlement of claris contingent matters partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate 

 

was a decrease in benefits related to deductions in excess of sharebased compensation cos ts windfall tax benefits the revaluation of swedish net deferred tax assets and miscellaneous transfer pricing related income tax accruals 

the company’s provision for income taxes and its effective rate increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to special items including provisional charges resulting from the 2017 tax act the taxfree net realized gains recognized in 2016 on the baxalta retained shares and resolution of uncertain tax positions related to a foreign subsidiary in 2016 in addition the company’s provision for income taxes and its effective tax rate in 2017 increased due to tax benefits recognized in 2016 from partially settling an irs 20082013 income tax audit settling a german 20082011 income tax audit and other miscellaneous transfer pricing matters partially offsetting the increase in the effective tax rate was a benefit of 56 million in 2017 related to deductions in excess of sharebased compensation costs windfall tax benefits and the mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions

the company anticipates that the effective income tax rate from continuing operations calculated in accordance with gaap will be approximately 18 in 2019 this rate may be further impacted by a number of factors including discrete items such as tax windfalls or deficiencies attributable to stock compensation exercises as well as additional audit developments or the tax effect of other special items

financial instrument market risk

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 10 and note 11 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies

currency risk

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese yuan korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen colombian peso brazilian real mexican peso and swedish krona the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2018 is 15 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 16 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 26 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2017 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 7 million would decrease by 25 million resulting in a net liability position

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2018 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the 

 

possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

the company’s operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting effective july 1 2018 changes in the value of the argentine peso applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset positions are recorded in income at the time of the change as of december 31 2018 the company’s net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos are not significant

interest rate and other risks

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 13 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2018 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2018 2017 and 2016 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year

changes in accounting standards

refer to note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on changes in accounting standards

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances

the company’s revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price transaction price which includes estimates of variable consideration for reserves related to rebates product returns sales discounts and wholesaler chargebacks  these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales managements estimates take into consideration historical experience current contractual and statutory requirements specific known market events and trends industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns overall these reserves reflect the company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract the amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period

the company’s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment 

the new standard related to revenue recognition has not had a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements as compared to historical revenue recognition guidelines refer to note 1 within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations

 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual compa ny experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future 

pension and opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees the service component of employee benefit expenses is reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense all other components of these employee benefit expenses are reported in other income expense net in the consolidated income statement the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following











selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 14 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2018 measurement date the company utilized discount rates of 431 and 420 to measure its benefit obligations for the us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively the company used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2018 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and other european countries the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 27 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 30 million

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2018 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 625 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will not change in 2019 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market 

 

and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 25 million

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans beginning with the december 31 2018 measurement date the company used the rp 2014 combined mortality table adjusted to reflect baxter specific past experience with improvements projected using the mp2018 projection scale adjusted to a long term improvement of 08 in 2034 for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 14 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare trend rates

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 17 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters at december 31 2018 total legal liabilities were 34 million

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims

deferred tax asset valuation allowances reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax reform

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income 

 

among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters th e company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in e xcess of established reserves 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the company including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others the company was required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring its us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 which allowed the company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date the company has completed its analysis in accordance with sab 118 and has finalized the accounting for the initial impact of the 2017 tax act refer to note 16 within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

valuation of intangible assets including iprd

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived intangible asset is charged to expense

iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist the company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units which are the same as its operating segments goodwill is tested for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative evaluation the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill as of december 31 2018 the date of the company’s annual impairment review the company determined that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were more likely than not in excess of their carrying values the company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinitelived intangible assets including iprd at least annually if the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment the company completes a quantitative impairment test intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information fair value measurements used in impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and reflect its judgements about the estimates and assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the related assets the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates

contractual arrangements 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally

raw materials

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces

in connection with the separation and distribution of baxalta baxter entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with baxalta baxalta manufactures and supplies baxter with artiss tisseel floseal and standalone thrombin under the manufacturing and supply agreement on a costplus basis

competition and healthcare cost containment

baxter’s businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of their product offerings as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics group purchasing organizations physicians and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to 

 

patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate

as part of these strategies we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market we are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety future divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results including return on investment and synergies and may not provide the desired market access the restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business as a result we may not achieve our targeted financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the rd process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer

issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products among other negative consequences

our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products the medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels these levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement seasonality natural disasters epidemics and other matters additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive as a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

additionally quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have a quality system that covers the 

 

lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occu r with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmenta l authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operat ions or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may r esult in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new pr oducts or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business and results of operations may be adversely affected

the manufacture of our products requires among other things the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from ourselves for selfsupplied requirements we endeavor either alone or working closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified for most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales additionally volatility in our costs of energy transportationfreight components raw materials and other supply manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations climate change including laws or regulations passed in response thereto could increase our costs in particular our costs of supply energy and transportationfreight material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products as well as our transportationfreight costs these outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above

some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences including those identified in the paragraph above because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise

 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage 

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure including support provided by our partners and third parties to support our business our products and our customers for example we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection use storage and transfer disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential business personal and other sensitive information we also rely on systems for manufacturing customer orders shipping regulatory compliance and various other matters certain of our products collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes

the increasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional intentional andor unauthorized exposure dissemination andor destruction of confidential information stored in our technology systems infrastructure and products our products devices computer systems servers and other technology systems and those of third parties that we use are vulnerable to breakdown interruption cyber and other security attacks system malfunction unauthorized access and other events security threats including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated frequent and adaptive any such vulnerability could compromise our technology systems and infrastructure and could expose personal andor proprietary information including sensitive personal information to unauthorized third parties andor cause permanent loss of such data in addition to loss of data unauthorized access to or interference with our products that utilize cloudbased computing or otherwise send and receive data may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety field actions andor product recalls while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns breaches in our systems or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards such breakdowns can lead to regulatory fines and penalties business disruption reputational harm financial loss as well as other damages we could also suffer strained relationships with customers and business partners increased costs for security measures remediation or otherwise litigation including class actions and stockholder derivative actions or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price from breaches cyber and other security attacks industrial espionage ransomware email or phishing scams malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns attacks breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information including protected health information phi on our behalf

additionally the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data including the health insurance portability and accountability act the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr in may 2018 the gdpr will supersede current european union data protection legislation impose more stringent european union data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance we or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations 

in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities we also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities the same testing and procedures sometimes apply to 

 

current products that are up for authorization renewal or are subject to changes in law or regulation for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new european union medical device regulation changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submis sions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt t he manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of custom er confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative gui dance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the comp any will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will no t be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the sunshine act enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the ppaca can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly 

additionally the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign control and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions including iran sudan syria russia and cuba these dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change additional restrictions may be enacted enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations

we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations please refer to note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad including through the implementation or repeal of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates then our business could suffer

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers these payers include medicare medicaid and private healthcare insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the united states public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products 

 

and services we may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our busines s financial condition and operational results 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products

the ppaca includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure certain portions of the ppaca including sections 2501a 2501b and 7101a could negatively impact the demand for our products and therefore our results of operations and financial position 

it is uncertain what impact the current us presidential administration might have on coverage reimbursement and other matters related to the ppaca andor healthcare reform in general including the timing and speed of any such impact 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess rd projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected

 

for more information on recent business development activities see note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property confidential information and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability monetary or currency volatility or instability including as it relates to the us dollar the euro the yuan and currencies in emerging market countries disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including natural disaster pandemic power loss cyber attack data breach war terrorism riot labor disruption civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

the 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union eu commonly known as brexit and the uk government’s subsequent initiation of the withdrawal process has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the eu withdrawal by the uk could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates and increased regulatory complexities these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

changes in for eign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors including in emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results

changes to the tax laws in the united states or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results in particular the recentlyenacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax reform including among other things certain changes in tax rates deductibility of interest deductibility of executive compensation expense expensing of capital expenditures the ability to use certain tax credits taxation on earnings from international business operations and the system of taxation from worldwide to territorial could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in certain instances tax reform could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of deferred tax balances any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance there remains some uncertainty regarding the implementation of such tax reform and its impact on us we cannot currently predict the full impact of tax reform on our business including revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for more information regarding the company’s provisional estimate of the impact of tax reform see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities our tax liabilities are affected by many factors including the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with armslength principles tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result

we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition

we are party to a number of pending lawsuits settlement discussions mediations arbitrations and other disputes in addition in the future we may be party to such disputes including patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation and other disputes including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits

 

 

 

 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate

 

our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section these fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our stock price

 

future material impairments in the value of our longlived assets including goodwill could negatively affect our operating results

 

we regularly review our longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets goodwill which results from our acquisition activity and property plant and equipment for impairment goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future in addition we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy including in connection with our strategic exits future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations for more information on the valuation and impairment of longlived assets refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “critical accounting policies” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2017 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 149 million while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the us dollar euro or yuan for more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

we may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of baxalta

on july 1 2015 we distributed approximately 805 of the outstanding shares of baxalta common stock to baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business we disposed of our remaining 195 stake in baxalta retained shares in 2016 in connection with a series of transactions including debtforequity exchanges an equityforequity exchange and a contribution to our us pension plan retained shares transactions shire plc shire acquired baxalta in june 2016 after completion of the last retained shares transaction in connection with the july 2015 distribution we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a tax matters agreement a long term services agreement a manufacturing and supply agreement a trademark license agreement a galaxy license agreement an international commercial operations agreement and certain other commercial agreements with baxalta these agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward including with respect to potential taxrelated losses associated with the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us

the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and baxalta and require us 

 

to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to baxalta third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for an y of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification w e may have to bear costs in addition our indemnity obligations to baxalta may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the separation and distribution of baxalta continues to involve a number of risks including among other things the indemnification risks described above certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time shire may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to baxalta under these agreements if baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations 

there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any retained shares transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future

the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions collectively the baxter transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to baxter and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the baxter transactions although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from kpmg llp regarding certain aspects of the baxalta spinoff not covered by the irs private letter ruling the opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by baxter and baxalta if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the baxter transactions the opinion or irs private letter ruling may not be valid moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the irs

if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the code

in anticipation of the proposed baxalta — shire merger the merger we entered into a letter agreement with shire and baxalta the letter agreement under the letter agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify and shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the letter agreement if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the baxter transactions baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities although baxalta and shire may be required to indemnify baxter under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from baxalta or the guarantee thereof by shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either baxalta or shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations

even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from baxalta or shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to bear these costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2017 the company’s us dollardenominated senior revolving credit facility and eurodenominated senior revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of 15 billion and approximately €200 million respectively both maturing in 2020 as of december 31 2017 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s respective commitment the company may at its option seek to increase the aggregate commitment under the us facility by up to an additional 750 million the facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants including a maximum net leverage ratio and maximum interest coverage ratio

the company also maintains other credit arrangements as described in note 8 in item 8

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the company had 34 billion of cash and equivalents as of december 31 2017 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives

the company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2017 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 149 million

while these economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2017 were as follows

 



 

 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2017 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities payable or maturing in the following periods

 



 





the company contributed 260 million 772 million and 178 million to its defined benefit pension and opeb plans in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 952 million at december 31 2017





offbalance sheet arrangements

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of the company’s significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 10 in item 8 for information regarding receivable securitizations note 11 in item 8 regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications and note 16 in item 8 regarding legal contingencies

financial instrument market risk

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 9 and note 10 in item 8 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies

 

curre ncy risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese yuan korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen colombian peso brazilian real mexican peso and new zealand dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2017 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2017 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 7 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 25 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 13 million would decrease by 34 million resulting in a net liability position

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2017 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2017 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances

interest rate and other risks

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 15 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2017 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2017 2016 and 2015 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year

changes in accounting standards

refer to note 1 in item 8 for information on changes in accounting standards

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from 

 

the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned specifically revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for product sales revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the shipping terms for the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are free on board fob destination the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers in these cases total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence tpe if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company uses its best estimate of selling prices

provisions for rebates chargebacks to wholesalers and distributors returns and discounts collectively sales deductions are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales the sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or that will be claimed on such sales

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate

pension and opeb plans

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following











selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 13 in item 8 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2017 measurement date the company utilized discount rates of 362 and 351 to measure its benefit obligations for the us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively the company used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2017 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were 

 

denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th per centile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield c urve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 40 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 44 million

effective january 1 2016 the company changed its approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost previously the company calculated the service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the company elected an alternative approach that utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company believes this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate as a result of this change the service cost and interest cost for these plans was reduced by 40 million in 2016 compared to the previous method

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2017 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 650 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will decrease to 625 in 2018 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 22 million

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans beginning with the december 31 2014 measurement date the company used the rp 2014 combined mortality table adjusted to reflect baxter specific past experience with improvements projected using the generational bb2d projection scale adjusted to a long term improvement of 08 in 2027 for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 13 in item 8 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare trend rates

 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 16 in item 8 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters at december 31 2017 total legal liabilities were 41 million

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims

deferred tax asset valuation allowances reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax reform

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the company including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others the company is required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring its us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows the company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months the company considers the accounting for the transition tax deferred tax remeasurements and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and its ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions the company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118

 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product

impairment of assets

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist the company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units which are the same as its operating segments as of december 31 2017 the date of the company’s annual impairment review the fair value of the company’s reporting units were in excess of their carrying values as discussed in note 6 of item 8 the company performed the goodwill impairment test both prior to and after the reallocation of its goodwill to its new reporting units based on a change in operating segments the company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinitelived intangible assets including iprd at least annually if the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment the company completes a quantitative impairment test intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 in item 8 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and when applicable market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates

stockbased compensation plans

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on a weightedaverage of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock with historical volatility more heavily weighted the expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option

the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant

 

psus granted in 2017 are based either on adjusted operating ma rgin or are based upon baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group the vesting condition for such psus based on adjusted operating margin have annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award duri ng the threeyear service period the holder of the adjusted operating margin psus is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage ranging from 0 to 200 of the adjusted operating margin psus granted depending on the act ual results compared to the annual performance targets such results may be further adjusted based on an assessment of the individual’s future potential compensation cost for the adjusted operating margin psus is measured based on the fair value of the aw ards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established the fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the company’s stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award the compensation co st for adjusted operating margin psus is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the adjusted operating margin vesting condition the probability of achieving the operating margin vesting condition is such that the compensation cost has been adjusted to reflect 200 attainment as of the year ended december 31 2017 the vesting condition for psus based on baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group is fair valued using a monte carlo model a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award refer to note 12 in item 8 for additional information

contractual arrangements

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally

raw materials

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces

in connection with the separation and distribution baxter entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with baxalta baxalta manufactures and supplies baxter with artiss tisseel floseal and standalone thrombin under the manufacturing and supply agreement on a costplus basis

 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s hospital products and renal businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of their product offerings as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics group purchasing organizations physicians and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products

intellectual property

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements these agreements may be breached and baxter may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition baxter’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that baxter’s employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad including through the implementation of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates then our business could suffer

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers these payers include medicare medicaid and private health care insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the united states public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products

for example in the united states the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure members of congress and the executive branch have made statements suggesting plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the ppaca because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ppaca including the potential for legal challenges or repeal of that legislation we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of any change in or replacement of the ppaca on our business and the demand for our products

 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any nega tive effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected

for more information on recent business development activities see note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business may be adversely affected

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier for most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier in very limited instances however we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above

 

some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a s ingle storage site loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer dem and or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability including instability as it relates to the euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

the 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union eu commonly known as brexit has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the eu the uk government is expected to initiate a process to withdraw from the eu in the coming months a withdrawal could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates as evidenced by the deterioration in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar following the brexit vote and increased regulatory complexities these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states members of the newly installed us congress including the speaker of the house paul ryan have identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for 2017 a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income or imported product could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with armslength principles taxing authorities may audit us from time to time disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems and products may pose a risk that sensitive data including protected health information phi may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost the increasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems products or in nonencrypted portable media or storage devices we could also experience a business interruption information theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners as our products continue to evolve thirdparties may attempt to access or obtain proprietary information from our products or systems additionally we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection dissemination access use security and phi including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information including phi on our behalf any such breakdown breach incident or failure to comply could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation business operations or financial condition in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and 

 

diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to b e selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 16 in item 8 of this annual re port on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2016 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 137 million while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the euro or yuan for more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

we may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution

on july 1 2015 we distributed approximately 805 of the outstanding shares of baxalta common stock to baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business we disposed of our remaining 195 stake in baxalta retained shares in 2016 in connection with a series of transactions including debtforequity exchanges an equityforequity exchange and a contribution to our us pension plan retained shares transactions shire plc shire acquired baxalta in june 2016 after completion of the last retained shares transaction in connection with the july 2015 distribution we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement a long term services agreement a manufacturing and supply agreement an employee matters agreement a trademark license agreement a galaxy license agreement an international commercial operations agreement a shareholders’ and registration rights agreement and certain other commercial agreements with baxalta these agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward including with respect to potential taxrelated losses associated with the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us

the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to baxalta third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to baxalta may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations

the separation of baxalta continues to involve a number of risks including among other things the indemnification risks described above and the potential that management’s and our employees’ attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time shire may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to baxalta under these agreements if baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

there could be signific ant liability if the separation and distribution or any retained shares transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

the separation and distribution and the retained shares transactions collectively the baxter transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to baxter and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the baxter transactions although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from kpmg llp regarding certain aspects of the baxalta spinoff not covered by the irs private letter ruling the opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by baxter and baxalta if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the baxter transactions the opinion or irs private letter ruling may not be valid moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the irs

if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the code

in anticipation of the proposed baxalta — shire merger the merger we entered into a letter agreement with shire and baxalta the letter agreement under the letter agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify and shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the letter agreement if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the baxter transactions baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities although baxalta and shire may be required to indemnify baxter under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from baxalta or the guarantee thereof by shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either baxalta or shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations

even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from baxalta or shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

the company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside the united states of which a substantial portion is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result most of the company’s cash and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries the company does not intend or foresee a need to repatriate these funds and expects existing domestic cash and shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

if the company should require more capital in the united states than is generated by its domestic operations eg to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases the company could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the united states through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of the company’s earnings the company has borrowed domestically and continues to believe it has the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2016 were as follows

 



 

contractual obligations

as of december 31 2016 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities payable or maturing in the following periods

 



 





the company contributed 772 million 157 million and 74 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 15 billion at december 31 2016



 



offbalance sheet arrangements

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of the company’s significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 10 in item 8 for information regarding receivable securitizations note 11 in item 8 regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications and note 16 in item 8 regarding legal contingencies

financial instrument market risk

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 9 and note 10 in item 8 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies

currency risk

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese yuan korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen colombian peso brazilian real swedish krona mexican peso and new zealand dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2016 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government in the first quarter of 2016 the venezuelan government moved from the threetier exchange rate system to a twotiered exchange rate system and the official rate for food and medicine imports was adjusted from 63 to 10 bolivars per us dollar this devaluation resulted in a charge of 9 million during the first quarter of 2016 as of december 31 2016 the company’s exposure to venezuelan operations was approximately 12 million

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 13 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 34 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 5 million would decrease by 17 million

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2016 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by 

 

losses from anothe r currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 19 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2016 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2016 2015 and 2014 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position

changes in accounting standards

refer to note 1 in item 8 for information on changes in accounting standards

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned specifically revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for product sales revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the shipping terms for the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are fob destination the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers in these cases total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence tpe if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company uses its best estimate of selling prices

provisions for rebates chargebacks to wholesalers and distributors returns and discounts collectively “sales deductions” are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales the sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or that will be claimed on such sales

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s 

 

warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes p resently established reserves are adequate 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following











selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 13 in item 8 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2016 measurement date the company utilized discount rates of 409 and 389 to measure its benefit obligations for the us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively the company used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2016 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 36 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 40 million

effective january 1 2016 the company changed its approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost previously the company calculated the service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the company elected an alternative approach that utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company believes this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate as a result of this change the service cost and interest cost for these plans was reduced by 40 million in 2016 compared to the previous method

 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2016 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 700 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will decrease to 650 in 2017 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 22 million

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans beginning with the december 31 2014 measurement date the company used the rp 2014 combined mortality table adjusted to reflect baxter specific past experience with improvements projected using the generational bb2d projection scale adjusted to a long term improvement of 08 in 2027 for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 13 in item 8 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare trend rates

legal contingencies

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 16 in item 8 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters at december 31 2016 total legal liabilities were 53 million

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback 

 

and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning acti ons that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves

valuation of intangible assets including iprd

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product

impairment of assets

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist the company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units which are the same as its operating segments renal and hospital products as of december 31 2016 the date of the company’s annual impairment review the fair value of the company’s reporting units were in excess of their carrying values the company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinitelived intangible assets including iprd at least annually if the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment the company completes a quantitative impairment test intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 in item 8 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and when applicable market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates

stockbased compensation plans

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock 

 

options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfei ture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on a weightedaverage of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock with historical volatility more heavily weighted the expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option 

the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant

psus granted in 2016 are based either on adjusted operating margin return on invested capital roic or are based upon baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group the vesting condition for such psus based on adjusted operating margin or roic have annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the threeyear service period the holder of the adjusted operating margin or roic psus is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage ranging from 0 to 200 of the adjusted operating margin or roic psus granted depending on the actual results compared to the annual performance targets as such results may be adjusted for individual performance compensation cost for the adjusted operating margin or roic psus is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established the fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the company’s stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award the compensation cost for adjusted operating margin or roic psus is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the adjusted operating margin or roic vesting condition the probability of achieving the operating margin vesting condition is such that the compensation cost has been adjusted to reflect 200 attainment as of the year ended december 31 2016 the vesting condition for psus based on baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group is fair valued using a monte carlo model a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award refer to note 12 in item 8 for additional information

certain regulatory matters

in january 2014 the company received a warning letter from fda primarily directed to quality systems for the company’s round lake illinois facility particularly in that facility’s capacity as a specification developer for certain of the company’s medical devices this warning letter was lifted in february 2017

sales and distribution 

the company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers in the united states third parties such as cardinal health inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of the company’s products through their distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries as of december 31 2015 

international operations 

the majority of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the united states and geographic expansion remains a core component of the company’s strategy baxter’s international presence includes operations in europe including eastern and central europe the middle east africa asiapacific latin america and canada the company is subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states for more information on these risks see the information under the captions “risks related to baxter’s business —we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally” and “— changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

contractual arrangements 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing 

  

arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces 

in connection with the separation and distribution baxter entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with baxalta baxalta manufactures and supplies baxter with artiss tisseel floseal and standalone thrombin under the manufacturing and supply agreement on a costplus basis 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s hospital products and renal businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of their product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics group purchasing organizations physicians and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic medical products manufacturers and suppliers and pharmaceutical companies in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces 

  

similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

risks related to baxter’s business 

we may not achieve our longterm financial improvement goals 

in connection with the separation and distribution we announced plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders these plans include the achievement of certain financial goals including improved operating margin in 2016 and beyond while we are continuing to refine these goals our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our longrange plan which covers the time period from 2015 through 2020 we have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets these strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally driving operational excellence through the rebasing of our cost structure and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital 

as part of these strategies we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market we are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety future divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results including return on investment and synergies and may not provide the desired market access the restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business as a result we may not achieve our targeted financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer 

  

issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products the medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels these levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement and seasonality additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive as a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

  

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical device companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the sunshine act enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations please refer to note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad including through the implementation of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates then our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors these payors include medicare medicaid and private health care insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payors outside the united states public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products 

for example in the united states the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the ppaca on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation 

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to 

  

increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

for more information on recent business development activities see note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier for most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier in very limited instances however we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect 

  

our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public 

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery 

  

act dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability including instability as it relates to the euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2015 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 211 million while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the euro or yuan for more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution 

on july 1 2015 we distributed approximately 805 of the outstanding shares of baxalta common stock to baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business after giving effect to the 

  

distribution we retained approximately 195 of the outstanding baxalta shares the retained shares in connection with the distribution we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement a long term services agreement a manufacturing and supply agreement an employee matters agreement a trademark license agreement a galaxy license agreement an international commercial operations agreement a shareholders’ and registration rights agreement and certain other commercial agreements these agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the two companies going forward including with respect to potential taxrelated losses associated with the separation and distribution and certain dispositions of the retained shares they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which baxalta manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us 

in connection with baxalta’s entry into a merger agreement with shire plc shire on january 11 2016 we entered into a letter agreement with shire and baxalta the letter agreement the letter agreement as further described below addresses certain matters related to the tax matters agreement and provides us with enhanced transaction support with respect to certain debtforequity andor equityforequity exchanges involving the retained shares the retained shares transactions see “— there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any later distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire with respect to the proposed combination of baxalta and shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future” for a more detailed discussion of the letter agreement 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to baxalta third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to baxalta may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the separation of baxalta continues to involve a number of risks including among other things the indemnification risks described above and the potential that management’s and our employees’ attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time if baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and distribution and such events may adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all although the separation of baxalta is expected to provide a number of benefits including among others enabling management to better focus on our medical products business providing the ability to more effectively commercialize new and existing product offerings drive innovation across our hospital products and renal businesses and allocate necessary resources to the areas presenting the highest growth potential and providing flexibility to pursue growth and investment strategies that could result in revenue acceleration improved profitability and enhanced returns if we fail to achieve some or all 

  

of the expected benefits of the separation or if such benefits are delayed our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our stock could be adversely impacted see “risks associated with our business — we may not achieve our longterm financial improvement goals” for additional information on risks associated with our postseparation strategies ” 

we may not be able to capture the full benefits from our retained stake in baxalta  

as of january 31 2016 we owned approximately 943 million baxalta shares after giving effect to a retained shares transaction as described above as with any investment in a publicly traded company this investment is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to baxalta’s business some of which are disclosed in baxalta’s filings with the sec including with respect to the proposed combination of baxalta and shire and risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in public equity markets generally 

in addition under the shareholders’ and registration rights agreement we committed to vote all of the retained shares in proportion to the votes cast by baxalta’s other stockholders although we have entered into the letter agreement such commitment could adversely impact our ability to exert influence that we may otherwise have over baxalta to act in a manner that we may believe best for protecting or enhancing the value of our investment 

additionally any disposition of the retained shares by us in the public market or the perception that such dispositions could occur could adversely affect prevailing market prices for baxalta shares and thereby adversely affect the value of the retained shares disposed of by us in any retained shares transaction or adversely affect the terms and conditions of such disposition 

there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or subsequent distribution of retained shares is determined to be a taxable transaction baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by shire with respect to the proposed combination of baxalta and shire but baxalta and shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future  

the separation and distribution the retained shares transactions and certain other uses of the retained shares including a contribution to our us qualified pension plan or dividend to our stockholders collectively the baxter transactions are intended to qualify for taxfree treatment to baxter and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the baxter transactions although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from kpmg llp regarding certain aspects of the baxalta spinoff not covered by the irs private letter ruling the opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by baxter and baxalta if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the baxter transactions the opinion or irs private letter ruling may not be valid moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the irs 

if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the code 

in connection with the proposed baxalta — shire merger we entered into the letter agreement with shire and baxalta as described above under the letter agreement from and after the closing of the merger baxalta 

  

agreed to indemnify and shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the letter agreement if the baxter transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the baxter transactions baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities although baxalta and shire may be required to indemnify baxter under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from baxalta or the guarantee thereof by shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either baxalta or shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations 

even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from baxalta or shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

optimizing the core portfolio globally 

baxter is in the process of evaluating and categorizing its product portfolio and the markets in which it operates to identify and invest in opportunities in which it has greatest potential to enhance returns these opportunities include product areas across mature and emerging markets 

additionally as part of its portfolio review baxter seeks to optimize its position in product areas where the company has a stable profitable business model identify and alter investments in products that have reached the end of their life cycles or with respect to which market positions have evolved unfavorably in the course of doing so baxter expects to reallocate capital to more promising opportunities as described above 

as part of this strategy baxter will focus its investments to drive innovation where it has compelling opportunities to serve patients and healthcare professionals while advancing the business and will accelerate the pace in bringing these advances to market baxter is in the midst of launching more than 50 products over the next five years in such areas as chronic and acute renal care smart pump technology hospital pharmaceuticals and nutritionals surgical sealants and more these comprise a mix of entirely new offerings marked improvements on existing technologies and the expansion of current products into new geographies 

  

operational excellence 

as part of its pursuit of improved margin performance baxter is working to rebase its cost structure consistent with its emergence as a standalone medical products company after the baxalta separation and distribution it is also critically assessing optimal support levels in light of the company’s ongoing portfolio optimization efforts 

the company intends to actively manage its cost structure to help ensure it is committing resources to where they will have the greatest value such high value activities include supporting innovation building out the portfolio expanding patient access and accelerating growth for the company’s stockholders 

baxter is undergoing a comprehensive review of all aspects of its operations and has already begun to implement changes in line with its business goals 

maintaining disciplined and balanced capital allocation 

baxter’s capital allocation strategies include the following 

 

  

  

  

 responsible corporate citizen 

the company strives for continued growth and profitability while furthering its focus on acting as a responsible corporate citizen at baxter sustainability means creating lasting social environmental and economic value by addressing the needs of the company’s wideranging stakeholder base baxter’s comprehensive sustainability program is focused on areas where the company is uniquely positioned to make a positive impact priorities include providing employees a safe healthy and inclusive workplace fostering a culture that drives integrity strengthening access to healthcare enhancing math and science education and driving environmental performance across the product life cycle including development manufacturing and transport baxter and the baxter international foundation provide financial support and product donations in support of critical needs from assisting underserved communities to providing emergency relief for countries experiencing natural disasters

results of operations 

special items 

the following table provides a summary of the company’s special items and the related impact by line item on the company’s results of continuing operations for 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

   

intangible asset amortization expense is identified as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance particularly in terms of cash returns and is similar to how management internally assesses performance additional special items are identified above because they are highly variable difficult to predict and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on the company’s results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company’s results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

net sales 

 net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 declined seven percent at actual currency rates but increased one percent on a constant currency basis net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 included 16 billion in gambro sales compared to 513 million in 2013 from the september 6 2013 acquisition date refer to note 5 in item 8 for further information regarding the gambro acquisition 

foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by eight percentage points during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year principally due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro australian dollar columbian peso and certain other currencies foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by one percentage point during the year ended december 31 2014 principally due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro swedish krona and certain other currencies 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period the company believes that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company’s results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

franchise net sales reporting 

effective january 1 2015 baxter modified its commercial franchise structure for reporting net sales prior period net sales have been recast to reflect the new commercial franchise structure 

as a result of the segment realignment the renal segment is presented as a separate commercial franchise and includes sales of the company’s peritoneal dialysis pd hemodialysis hd and continuous renal replacement therapies crrt 

the hospital products segment includes four commercial franchises fluid systems integrated pharmacy solutions surgical care and other 

 

  

   

  

 the following is a summary of net sales by commercial franchise 

 

 net sales in the renal segment decreased 9 in 2015 from 2014 but increased 35 in 2014 compared to 2013 foreign currencies had an unfavorable foreign currency impact of ten percentage points in 2015 and three percentage points in 2014 net sales in the hospital products segment declined 6 in 2015 but increased 4 in 2014 foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact of seven percentage points in 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency the principal drivers impacting net sales were the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 gross margin and expense ratios 

 gross margin 

the special items previously identified in the above had an unfavorable impact of 17 21 and 26 percentage points on the gross margin percentage in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively refer to the special items above for additional detail 

in addition to the impact of the special items the gross margin percentage in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by decreased sales of cyclophosphamide within the hospital products segment partially offset by improved product mix in the renal segment 

in addition to the impact of the special items the 2014 gross margin percentage was unfavorably impacted as a result of the integration of the lower margin gambro business other unfavorable impacts include foreign currency expedited freight for pd solutions and manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from lower production volumes as the company continues to make investments to enhance its operations quality systems and processes 

marketing and administrative expenses 

the special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 26 12 and 24 percentage points on the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively refer to the special items caption above for additional detail 

excluding the impact of the special items the marketing and administrative expense ratio in 2015 was impacted by the benefits from the company’s business optimization actions as the company resets its cost structure reduced its discretionary spending and benefited from certain costs charged to baxalta under the transition services agreement this was partially offset by bad debt expense in emerging markets 

  

excluding the impact of the special items the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2014 was unfavorably impacted as a result of inclusion of gambro’s operations and incremental freight and logistical expenses to support the strong demand for iv and pd solutions these unfavorable impacts in 2014 were more than offset by savings from the company’s continued focus on controlling discretionary spending lower pension expense and benefits from the company’s business optimization initiatives 

pension plan expense

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the company had 22 billion of cash and equivalents as of december 31 2015 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions

if baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be further downgraded the company’s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted however any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt unless with respect to certain debt instruments preceded by a change in control of the company 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2015 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits payable or maturing in the following periods 

 

  

  

   

the company contributed 157 million 74 million and 67 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively most of the company’s plans are funded the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 17 billion at december 31 2015

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro british pound chinese yuan korean won australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen columbian peso brazilian real swedish krona and mexican peso the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2015 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 

  

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government since january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company as of december 31 2015 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 43 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2015 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s total net sales 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 5 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 17 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 12 million would decrease by 72 million 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2015 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 29 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2015 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2015 2014 and 2013 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

as discussed in note 10 in item 8 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those liabilities 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position

 selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 13 in item 8 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

effective for the december 31 2015 measurement date the company utilized discount rates of 436 and 412 to measure its benefit obligations for the us and puerto rico pension plans and opeb plan respectively the company used a broad population of approximately 200 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2015 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 42 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 50 million 

effective january 1 2016 the company will change its approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost previously the company calculated the service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the company has elected an alternative approach that utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company believes this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the company will account for this change prospectively as a change in estimate as a result of this change in 2016 the company estimates that the service cost and interest cost for these plans will be reduced by approximately 40 million in 2016 compared to the previous method 

  

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring the net periodic cost for 2015 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 725 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will decrease to 700 in 2016 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 18 million 

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans beginning with the december 31 2014 measurement date the company used the rp 2014 combined mortality table adjusted to reflect baxter specific past experience with improvements projected using the generational bb2d projection scale adjusted to a long term improvement of 08 in 2027 at the december 31 2015 measurement date the company refined its baxter specific past experience adjustment which will result in approximately 15 million of incremental expense in 2016 for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 13 in item 8 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare trend rates 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 16 f in item 8 or further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved at december 31 2015 total legal liabilities were 29 million 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

  

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

  

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist the company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units which are the same as its operating segments renal and hospital products as of december 31 2015 the date of the company’s annual impairment review the fair value of the company’s reporting units were in excess of their carrying values the company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinitelived intangible assets including iprd at least annually if the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment the company completes a quantitative impairment test intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 in item 8 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and when applicable market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on a weightedaverage of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock with historical volatility more heavily weighted the expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option 

the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant 

current outstanding psus are based either on return on invested capital roic or are based upon baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group the vesting condition for such psus based on return on invested capital roic have annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the threeyear service period the holder of the roic psus is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage ranging from 0 to 200 of the roic psus granted depending on the actual results compared to the annual performance targets compensation cost for the roic psus is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established the fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the company’s stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award the compensation cost for roic psus is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition the probability of achieving 

  

the roic vesting condition has not materially changed during the year ended december 31 2015 the vesting condition for psus based on baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group is fair valued using a monte carlo model a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award refer to note 12 in item 8 for additional information

contractual arrangements 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy in order to produce plasmabased therapies the company also collects plasma at numerous collection facilities in the united states and europe for more information on plasma collection refer to the discussion under the caption “the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces 

  

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s bioscience and medical products businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medical products business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics group purchasing organizations pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medical products faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements these agreements may be breached and baxter may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition baxter’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by 

  

competitors to the extent that baxter’s employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

baxter’s investment in research and development rd is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain competitive in each of its business segments accordingly baxter continues to focus its investment on rd programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation expenditures for baxter’s rd activities were 14 billion in 2014 12 billion in 2013 and 11 billion in 2012 these expenditures include costs associated with rd activities performed at the company’s rd centers located around the world which include facilities in austria belgium sweden italy germany china japan and the united states as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for rd work performed at nonbaxter locations included in baxter’s rd activities in 2014 were upfront and milestone payments of 217 million related to collaboration arrangements and 83 million related to business optimization charges

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer 

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

our success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or 

  

other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical device companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and 

  

competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the sunshine act enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations please refer to note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad including through the implementation of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates then our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors these payors include medicare medicaid and private health care insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payors outside the united states public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in much of europe latin america asia and australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products 

for example in the united states the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the ppaca on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain 

as a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis 

  

legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us we cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research academic and governmental institutions 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation 

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

for more information on recent business development activities see note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity 

the production of plasmabased therapies is a lengthy and complex process and we source our plasma both externally and internally through biolife plasma services lp biolife our whollyowned subsidiary efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasmabased therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and plasma fractionation facilities we are in the process of building a stateoftheart manufacturing facility near covington georgia to support growth of our plasmabased treatments with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2018 the development of such facilities involves a lengthy regulatory process and is highly capital intensive in addition access totransport and use of plasma may be subject to restrictions by governmental agencies both inside and outside the united states as a result our ability to match our collection and production of plasmabased therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased therapies or alternatively an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasmabased therapies close collection and processing facilities record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier for most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier in very limited instances however we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

  

the proposed spinoff of baxter’s biopharmaceutical business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all and may not achieve the intended results 

in march 2014 baxter announced plans to create two separate independent global healthcare companies — one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on lifesaving medical products — through a taxfree distribution to baxter shareholders of publicly traded stock in the new biopharmaceuticals company the transaction is expected to be completed by midyear 2015 unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spinoff including but not limited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory tax and works council approvals or clearances in addition consummation of the proposed spinoff will require final approval from our board of directors therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced if at all 

we will incur significant expenses in connection with the spinoff in addition completion of the proposed spinoff will require significant amounts of management’s time and effort which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations further if the spinoff is completed it may not achieve the intended results the spinoff will also require modifications to the company’s systems and processes used to operate our business and accurately maintain the company’s books and records we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications which could adversely affect our business operations results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public 

although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach to the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work 

  

diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability including instability as it relates to the euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

we generate the majority of our revenue outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks we may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries we are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage 

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and 

  

other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost the increasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or in nonencrypted portable media or storage devices we could also experience a business interruption information theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation business operations or financial condition in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2014 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 363 million while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the

credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facilities 

the company’s primary revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of 15 billion and matures in december 2015 in 2014 the company entered into an additional revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of 18 billion which also matures in december 2015 and contains similar covenants as the primary revolving credit facility the company also maintains a eurodenominated revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of approximately 375 million as of december 31 2014 and matures in december 2015 as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under any of these revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2013 there was approximately 124 million outstanding under the eurodenominated facility and there were no outstanding borrowings under the primary revolving credit facility the company’s facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants including a maximum netdebttocapital ratio at december 31 2014 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting any of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s respective commitment 

the company also maintains other credit arrangements as described in note 8 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the company had 29 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2014 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates the divestiture of the vaccines franchise is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives 

the company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 363 million and 561 million respectively the decrease in net accounts receivable reflects strong collections in both spain and portugal while global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses 

  

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2014 were as follows 

 

 in march 2014 standard  poor’s lowered its ratings on baxter’s senior debt to a and shortterm debt to a2 from a and a1 respectively at december 31 2013 the change in the credit ratings and outlook is due to the uncertainty around the planned spinoff of baxter’s biopharmaceuticals business as detailed above 

if baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be further downgraded the company’s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted however any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt unless with respect to certain debt instruments preceded by a change in control of the company 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2014 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits payable or maturing in the following periods 

 

  

  

 the company contributed 74 million 67 million and 78 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively most of the company’s plans are funded the timing of funding in the 

  

future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 22 billion at december 31 2014 

 

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of the company’s significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 10 for information regarding receivable securitizations note 11 regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications and note 16 regarding legal contingencies 

financial instrument market risk 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 9 and note 10 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real colombian peso and swedish krona the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2014 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 

  

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government since january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar effective february 8 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 43 to 63 which resulted in a charge of 11 million during 2013 as of december 31 2014 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 26 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2014 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s total net sales 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 12 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 72 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 18 million would decrease by 71 million 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2014 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 21 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2014 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2014 2013 and 2012 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

as discussed in note 10 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those liabilities 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position 

  

changes in accounting standards 

refer to note 1 for information on changes in accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position there have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during 2014 the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned specifically revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for product sales revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the shipping terms for the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are fob destination the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers in these cases total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence tpe if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company uses its best estimate of selling prices 

provisions for rebates chargebacks to wholesalers and distributors returns and discounts collectively “sales deductions” are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales the sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or that will be claimed on such sales 

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans 

  

is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 13 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the december 31 2014 measurement date the company used a discount rate of 400 and 395 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively these discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2015 the company used a broad population of approximately 350 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2014 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 700 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by approximately 44 million and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by approximately 54 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2014 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 750 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2015 this assumption will decrease to 725 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

  

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 19 million 

other assumptions 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the december 31 2014 measurement date the company used the rp 2014 combined mortality table adjusted to reflect past experience for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 13 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 16 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved at december 31 2014 total legal liabilities were 72 million 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

  

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist the company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units 

  

which are the same as its operating segments bioscience and medical products as of december 31 2014 the date of the company’s annual impairment review the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of their carrying values the company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinitelived intangible assets including iprd at least annually if the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment the company completes a quantitative impairment test intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and a market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on a weightedaverage of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock with historical volatility more heavily weighted the expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option 

the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant 

as part of an overall periodic evaluation of the company’s stock compensation programs the company changed the vesting condition for 50 of the psus granted to senior management beginning with its 2013 annual equity awards the vesting condition for these psus is based on return on invested capital roic with annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the threeyear service period the holder of the roic psus is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage ranging from 0 to 200 of the roic psus granted depending on the actual results compared to the annual performance targets compensation cost for the roic psus is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established the fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the company’s stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award the compensation cost for roic psus is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition the probability of achieving the vesting condition has not materially changed during the year ended december 31 2014 the remaining 50 of the psus continued to include conditions for vesting based on baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group the company uses a monte carlo model for estimating the fair value of these psus a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award refer to note 12 for additional information

sales and distribution 

the company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers in the united states third parties such as cardinal health inc and owens  minor inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of the company’s products through their distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries 

  

international operations 

the majority of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the united states and geographic expansion remains a core component of the company’s strategy baxter’s international presence includes operations in europe including eastern and central europe the middle east africa asiapacific latin america and canada the company is subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states for more information on these risks see the information under the captions “we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally” and “we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

contractual arrangements 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries for example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia the result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the company’s markets globally 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy in order to produce plasmabased therapies the company also collects plasma at numerous collection facilities in the united states and europe for more information on plasma collection refer to the discussion under the caption “the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces 

  

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s bioscience and medical products businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medical products business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers and patients including hospitals and clinics customer purchasing groups pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medical products faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value 

  

for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information on patent and other litigation see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

our success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products additionally baxter 

  

has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states may adversely affect our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact the company’s businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices in 2011 the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government and in 2013 the company became subject to a 23 tax on sales of certain of its medical devices the impact of the increased medicaid rebates and the expanded 340b drug pricing program is largely to our bioscience business while the additional taxes impact both of our business segments we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the ppaca on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain similarly we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the ppaca’s provisions 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors these payors include medicare medicaid and private health care insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payors outside the united states public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products accordingly reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research academic and governmental institutions 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation 

  

competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity 

the production of plasmabased therapies is a lengthy and complex process efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasmabased therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities andor plasma fractionation facilities the development of such facilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process as a result our ability to match our collection and production of plasmabased therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand for our plasmabased therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share or customer confidence in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasmabased therapies close collection and processing facilities record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

  

several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility loss or damage to a manufacturing facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful including our integration of gambro our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

in september 2013 we completed the acquisition of gambro for a total purchase price of 37 billion excluding adjustments for net indebtedness which was financed in part by proceeds of approximately 30 billion from debt issuances in june 2013 these additional debt issuances significantly increased the company’s outstanding debt and will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives the integration of gambro’s operations will require 

  

significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts will result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot be dedicated to other projects our failure to successfully integrate gambro’s operations into our own could result in a failure to achieve expected synergies a failure to achieve our strategic objectives with respect to the gambro acquisition could result in slower growth higher than expected costs the closure of facilities the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 14 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 15 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits

results of operations 

special items 

the following table provides a summary of the company’s special items and the related impact by line item on the company’s results of operations for 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 special items are identified above because they are highly variable difficult to predict and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on the company’s gaap results may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company’s results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another upfront and milestone payments related to 

  

collaborative arrangements that have been expensed as rd are uncertain and often result in a different payment and expense recognition pattern than internal rd activities and therefore are typically excluded as special items

net sales 

 foreign currency did not have a significant impact on net sales in 2013 as the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro was offset by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen and certain other currencies foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by 3 percentage points in 2012 principally due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro excluding the impact of foreign currency total net sales growth was 8 and 5 in 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily driven by improved sales volumes demand

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period the company believes that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company’s results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

  

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 18 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 71 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 37 million would increase by 10 million 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2013 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 31 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2013 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2013 2012 and 2011 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

as discussed in note 9 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position 

changes in accounting standards 

refer to note 1 for information on changes in accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements there have been no significant changes in the company’s 

  

application of its critical accounting policies during 2013 the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned refer to note 1 for additional information regarding the company’s accounting policy for revenue recognition including the company’s accounting for arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers 

provisions for discounts rebates to customers chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales these estimates are reviewed periodically and if necessary revised with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 12 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the measurement date december 31 2013 the company used a discount rate of 485 and 490 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively these discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2014 the company used a broad population of approximately 240 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2013 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 490 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 53 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2013 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 750 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2014 this assumption will remain at 750 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 18 million 

other assumptions 

the company used the rp 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 12 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

  

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 15 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at december 31 2013 total legal liabilities were 160 million and total related receivables were 7 million 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a 

  

discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and a market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant 

in 2013 the company changed the vesting condition for 50 of the psus granted to senior management beginning with its 2013 annual equity awards the vesting condition for the new psus is based on return on invested capital with annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the threeyear service period the remaining 50 of the psus continued to include conditions for vesting based on baxter stock performance relative to the company’s peer group similar to previous years compensation cost for the new psus is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the 

  

specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established and the company adjusts compensation cost at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition for the remaining psus the company uses a monte carlo model for estimating the fair value of psus and significant inputs include the riskfree rate volatility of returns and correlation of returns refer to note 11 for additional information 

certain regulatory matters 

in january 2014 the company received a warning letter from fda primarily directed to quality systems for the company’s round lake illinois facility particularly in that facility’s capacity as a specification developer for certain of the company’s medical devices the letter also included observations related to the company’s ambulatory infusor business in irvine california which previously had been subject to agency action the company is working with fda to resolve this matter as well as each of the matters listed below

contractual arrangements 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy in order to produce plasmabased therapies the company also collects plasma at numerous collection facilities in the united states and europe for more information on plasma collection refer to the discussion under the caption “the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s bioscience and medical products businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medical products business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the medical products business also benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pd products as well as its 

  

strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medical products faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for products and sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payors in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process a successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and increased scrutiny by fda and other regulatory authorities globally any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs for information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements 

  

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda oig doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently are considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations please refer to note 13 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

our success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program while we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products 

unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

for more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states may adversely affect our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act act which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact the company’s businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices in 2011 the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government in 2013 the company will be required to pay a 23 tax on sales of certain of its medical devices the impact of the increased medicaid rebates and the expanded 340b drug pricing program is largely expected to impact our bioscience business while the additional taxes are expected to impact both of our business segments we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the act reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain similarly we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the act’s provisions 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors these payors include medicare medicaid and private health care insurers in the united states and foreign governments and thirdparty payors outside the united states public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from thirdparty payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products accordingly reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us 

there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research academic and governmental institutions 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with gpos idns or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies 

  

complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity 

the production of plasmabased therapies is a lengthy and complex process efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasmabased therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities andor plasma fractionation facilities such as the covington georgia facility the site selection of which we announced in april 2012 the development of such facilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process as a result our ability to match our collection and production of plasmabased therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand for our plasmabased therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share or customer confidence in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasmabased therapies close collection and processing facilities record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 

several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility loss or damage to a manufacturing facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other 

  

countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the proposed acquisition of gambro ab may adversely affect our financial condition and our business 

in december 2012 we announced an agreement to purchase gambro ab gambro the closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals including multiple antitrust approvals and other closing conditions while the closing of the transaction is expected to occur at the end of the second quarter of 2013 there can be no assurance that the closing will in fact occur or that significant delays in closing the transaction will not result a failure to close the transaction or significant delays in doing so may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and our business financial condition and results of operations we expect to issue at least 30 billion of debt during the first half of 2013 to fund the planned acquisition of gambro which will significantly increase the company’s outstanding debt this additional indebtedness will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives including stock repurchases we performed substantial due diligence in connection with this transaction but undiscovered and unanticipated risks and liabilities may emerge after the closing the integration of gambro’s operations will require significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts will result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot be dedicated to other projects our failure to successfully integrate gambro’s operations into our own could result in a failure to achieve expected synergies a failure to achieve our strategic objectives with respect to the gambro acquisition could result in slower growth higher than expected costs the closure of facilities the recording of asset 

  

impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for more information on this acquisition see note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability including instability as it relates to the euro disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

we generate the majority of our revenue outside the united states as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the venezuelan government is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results for more information on ongoing audits see note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to accurately maintain the company’s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the company’s management team the company’s erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested significant resources in planning and project management significant implementation issues may arise 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure 

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 13 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2012 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 385 million of which 66 million is related to greece the global economic conditions and governmental actions in these and other countries may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and require us to reevaluate the collectibility and valuation of our receivables which could result in additional credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the euro for more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facilities 

the company’s primary revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of 15 billion and matures in june 2015 the company also maintains a eurodenominated credit facility with a maximum capacity of approximately 389 million at december 31 2012 in 2012 the company amended this facility to extend the maturity date to october 2013 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities the company’s facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates determined in part by the company’s credit ratings and contain various covenants including a maximum netdebttocapital ratio at december 31 2012 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s respective commitment 

in january 2013 baxter entered into an agreement related to a 364day bridge loan facility with a maximum capacity of 31 billion in connection with the planned acquisition of gambro the terms of the bridge loan facility are substantially similar to the terms of the company’s primary revolving credit facility the company intends to finance the transaction with offshore cash and the issuance of at least 30 billion of debt the company does not anticipate utilizing the bridge loan facility 

the company also maintains other credit arrangements as described in note 7 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the company had 33 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2012 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions the company plans to issue at least 30 billion of debt during the first half of 2013 to fund the planned acquisition of gambro which will significantly increase the company’s outstanding debt 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives 

  

the company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2012 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 385 million of which 66 million related to greece the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector for the countries identified above decreased by 139 million during 2012 primarily as a result of the collection of certain past due receivables in spain while the economic downturn has not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses 

with respect to the greek government bonds the company collected 17 million in december 2011 upon the maturity of the first tranche of the bonds however as a result of continued economic uncertainty and ongoing greek government negotiations regarding the settlement terms for outstanding bonds the company recorded an impairment charge of 41 million in 2011 to reduce the remaining greek government bonds held by the company to estimated fair value the estimated fair value of these bonds was calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated observable inputs including interest rate yields in march 2012 the company’s greek government debt holdings were restructured into new greek government bonds with a notional amount of 24 million ranging in maturity from 11 to 30 years and european financial stability facility efsf bonds with a notional amount of 11 million maturing in one to two years in the second quarter of 2012 the company sold all of its greek government and efsf bond holdings from which the company received 14 million in proceeds refer to note 8 for further information 

the company also previously recorded a charge of 28 million in 2010 to write down its accounts receivable in greece principally as a result of the greek government’s announcement of a plan to convert certain past due receivables into noninterest bearing bonds with maturities of one to three years 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

 in 2012 standard  poor’s downgraded the company’s senior debt ratings by one notch from a to a and both fitch and moody’s changed their outlook from stable to negative these downgrades were a result of the company’s december 2012 announcement of the proposed acquisition of gambro and the plans to fund the acquisition with at least 30 billion of debt which would significantly increase the company’s debt level 

if baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be further downgraded the company’s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted however any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt unless with respect to certain debt instruments preceded by a change in control of the company 

  

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2012 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits payable or maturing in the following periods 

 

  

  

 the company contributed 78 million 251 million and 416 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively most of the company’s plans are funded the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 17 billion at december 31 2012 

 

  

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of the company’s significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 9 for information regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications note 8 regarding receivable securitizations and note 13 regarding legal contingencies 

financial instrument market risk 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 8 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real colombian peso and swedish krona the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2012 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies in december 2012 the company entered into option contracts with a total notional amount of 28 billion to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the planned acquisition of gambro these contracts are not formally designated as hedges and mature in june 2013 changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and may be significant subjecting the company’s earnings to additional volatility 

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of 215 relative to the us dollar the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential such as food and medicine was changed to 26 while the rate for payments for nonessential goods was changed to 43 in 2010 the majority of the company’s products imported into venezuela were classified as essential goods and qualified for the 26 rate effective january 1 2011 the venezuelan government devalued the official currency for imported goods classified as essential to 43 since january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company as of december 31 2012 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 35 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2012 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s 

  

total net sales effective february 8 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 43 to 63 which is not expected to have a material impact on the financial results of the company 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 37 million with respect to those contracts would increase by 10 million a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 32 million would decrease by 44 million resulting in a net liability position 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2012 with exchange rates that are 10 weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 32 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2012 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2012 2011 and 2010 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

as discussed in note 8 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position 

changes in accounting standards 

refer to note 1 for information on changes in accounting standards 

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements there have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during 2012 the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned refer to note 1 for additional information regarding the company’s accounting policy for revenue recognition including the company’s accounting for arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers 

provisions for discounts rebates to customers chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales these estimates are reviewed periodically and if necessary revised with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 11 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the measurement date december 31 2012 the company used a discount rate of 395 and 400 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively these discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2013 the company used a broad population of approximately 320 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2012 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 52 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2012 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 775 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2013 this assumption will decrease to 750 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 18 million 

  

other assumptions 

the company used the rp 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 11 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 13 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at december 31 2012 total legal liabilities were 113 million and total related receivables were 33 million 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of 

  

deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired inprocess rd iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

rd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy in order to produce plasmabased therapies the company also collects plasma at numerous collection facilities in the united states for more information on plasma collection refer to the discussion under the caption “the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

competition and healthcare cost containment 

baxter’s bioscience and medical products businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medical products business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the medical products business also benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medical products faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

intellectual property

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we operate in highly competitive and innovative businesses we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness involve significant technical and business risks the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economic and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors if we cannot successfully introduce new products adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales in addition requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities are subject to change and compliance with additional requirements may result in product launch delays and otherwise increase our costs

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

our success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program that includes an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key effectiveness indicators while we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our rd clinical and manufacturing organizations third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products 

for more information on regulatory matters currently being addressed by the company refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

implementation of the fda order to recall our colleague infusion pumps in the united states may adversely affect our business 

pursuant to the consent decree entered into by the company in june 2006 the fda issued a final order in july 2010 regarding the recall of the company’s colleague infusion pumps currently in use in the united states the company is executing the recall by offering its customers an option to replace their colleague infusion 

  

pumps or receive monetary consideration under the replacement option the company’s customers may receive the sigma international general medical apparatus llc sigma spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their colleague infusion pumps for more information on the colleague recall refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the company cannot be certain that sigma will have sufficient production capacity to meet the demand for sigma spectrum infusion pumps customers choosing a refund or for whom sufficient replacement pumps are unavailable are likely to move to a competitive infusion pump platform many of the company’s colleague customers also purchase a variety of products from the company’s medical products business if a significant number of colleague customers move to a competitive pump platform our business may suffer and sales of other products in the company’s medical products portfolio may be adversely affected in addition it is possible that substantial additional cash and noncash charges including significant asset impairments related to the colleague infusion pumps and related businesses may be required in future periods based on new information changes in estimates the implementation of the recall in the united states and other actions the company may be required to undertake in markets outside the united states 

the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states may adversely affect our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act act which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact the company’s businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices in 2011 the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government in 2013 the company will be required to pay a 23 tax on sales of certain of its medical devices the impact of the increased medicaid rebates and the expanded 340b drug pricing program is largely expected to impact the company’s bioscience business while the additional taxes are expected to impact both of the company’s business segments we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the act reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain similarly we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the act’s provisions 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad our business could suffer 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services we may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from thirdparty payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 

the imposition of austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products accordingly our current and future products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverse to us 

we face substantial competition across each of our product categories 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition 

  

is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business will become less profitable the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with group purchasing organizations integrated delivery networks or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

the nature of producing plasmabased therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity 

the production of plasmabased therapies is a lengthy and complex process efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasmabased therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities andor plasma fractionation facilities which can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process as a result our ability to match our collection and production of plasmabased therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand for our plasmabased therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share or customer confidence in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasmabased therapies close collection and processing facilities record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

  

a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals or licenses 

several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility loss or damage to a manufacturing facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

as part of our longterm growth strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

our operations both inside and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in exchange controls loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases nationalization increasingly complex labor environments expropriation and other governmental actions availability of raw materials changes in taxation importation limitations export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

in 2011 we generated approximately 60 of our revenue outside the united states we anticipate that revenue from outside the united states will continue to be significant as a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates market volatility and currency fluctuations may limit our ability to costeffectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure and in addition there are limitations in our ability to hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations in certain emerging markets governments may impose currency restrictions limiting our ability to manage our foreign currency exposure we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the venezuelan government is contained under the caption “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results 

tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the united states a significant change to the tax system in the united states including changes to the taxation of international income could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to accurately maintain the company’s books and records and provide information to the company’s management team important to the operation of the business the company’s erp has required and will continue to require the investment of significant human and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp without experiencing significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested significant resources in planning and project management there is no assurance that a significant implementation issue will not arise 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure 

we increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition there can be no assurances that a significant implementation issue may not arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

if we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including with respect to patent and product liability matters in addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits these current and future matters may result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters in view of these uncertainties we cannot assure that the outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance we also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees see note 11 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding current lawsuits 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2011 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 524 million the global economic conditions and governmental actions in these and other countries may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and require us to reevaluate the collectibility and valuation of our receivables which could result in additional credit losses these conditions may also impact the stability of the euro for more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “credit facilities access to capital and credit ratings” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

financial results 

baxter’s 2011 results reflect the company’s success in generating strong sustainable operational performance through leveraging the benefits of the diversified and medically necessary nature of the company’s portfolio advancing its product pipeline and geographic reach through the launch of innovative products and disciplined execution of the company’s strategies despite a challenging global macroeconomic and increasingly regulated environment in 2011 baxter was able to improve sales growth and profitability while also accelerating research and development rd spending to record levels and investing in future growth through multiple business development initiatives 

baxter’s global net sales totaled 139 billion in 2011 an increase of 8 over 2010 including a favorable foreign currency impact of 2 percentage points international sales totaled 82 billion an increase of 8 over 2010 including a favorable foreign currency impact of 4 percentage points sales in the united states totaled 57 billion in 2011 an increase of 8 over 2010 including the favorable impact of 4 percentage points from the prior year colleague infusion pump charge as further discussed below

baxter continues to focus on several key objectives to successfully execute its longterm strategy to achieve sustainable growth and deliver shareholder value baxter’s diversified healthcare model its broad portfolio of products that treat lifethreatening acute or chronic conditions and its global presence are core components of the company’s strategy to achieve these objectives 

rd innovation and scientific productivity continue to be a key strategic priority for baxter the company’s investments in rd reflect its efforts to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation including the broadening of its hemophilia portfolio with continued innovation exploration of alternative routes of administration of gammagard liquid immune globulin infusion human marketed as kiovig in most markets outside the united states and expansion of label indications with a focus on neurological disorders leveraging of recombinant protein expertise to expand the product portfolio advancing the science of regenerative medicine and the development of home hd therapy key developments in 2011 included the following rd milestones product approvals and product launches

 other developments 

 

  

   

  

  

 in 2012 the company will continue to invest in its rd pipeline supporting the progress of investigational therapies and latestage clinical development to obtain approvals and launch innovative products in the global marketplace 

baxter also plans to augment its internal rd by making strategic investments in earlystage development through baxter ventures a strategic initiative established in july 2011 to invest up to 200 million in earlystage companies developing products and therapies to accelerate innovation and growth for the company 

the company plans to further supplement its internal rd activities and pursue accelerated growth by fully capitalizing on baxter’s diversified healthcare model with its investment in other business development opportunities including acquisitions collaborations and alliances in 2011 baxter entered into several business development initiatives including the following

the company’s ability to sustain longterm growth and successfully execute the strategies discussed above depends in part on the company’s ability to manage within an increasingly competitive and regulated environment and to address the other risk factors described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

net sales 

 foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by 2 percentage points in 2011 principally due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro the australian dollar and the japanese yen foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by 1 percentage point in 2010 as the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro was more than offset by the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies including the australian dollar the canadian dollar and the japanese yen 

total net sales growth in 2011 was favorably impacted by 2 percentage points while growth in 2010 was unfavorably impacted by 2 percentage points due to the colleague infusion pump charge which reduced net sales in the medical products segment in 2010 by 213 million refer to note 5 for further information regarding this charge in addition healthcare reform legislation enacted in the united states in the first quarter of 2010 unfavorably impacted sales growth in 2010 by approximately 05 percentage points primarily impacting the recombinants plasma proteins and antibody therapy product categories in the bioscience segment similar reform actions undertaken by governments outside the united states also unfavorably impacted sales growth 

additionally included in net sales in the medical products segment are sales of 58 million and 198 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively related to the us multisource generic injectables business which was divested by the company in may 2011 the divestiture of this business unfavorably impacted total net sales growth by 1 percentage point in 2011 refer to note 3 for further information regarding this divestiture 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period 

the company believes that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company’s results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

  

bioscience the following is a summary of net sales by product category in the bioscience segment 

 

 net sales in the bioscience segment increased 7 and 1 in 2011 and 2010 respectively with a favorable foreign currency impact of 2 percentage points in 2011 and no meaningful impact from foreign currency in 2010 excluding the impact of foreign currency the principal drivers impacting net sales were the following

gross margin and expense ratios 

 

 gross margin 

during 2011 the gross margin percentage improved primarily as a result of the 588 million charge in 2010 related to the recall of colleague infusion pumps from the us market which unfavorably impacted 2010 gross margin percentage by 37 percentage points the gross margin percentage in 2011 2010 and 2009 was unfavorably impacted by business optimization charges of which 95 million 132 million and 30 million were recorded in cost of sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these charges impacted the gross margin percentage by 07 10 and 02 percentage points in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in addition to the factors above the gross margin percentage in 2011 benefited from favorable business mix due to sales growth of select higher margin products in the bioscience and medical products segments as well as the favorable impact of the divestiture of the lower margin us multisource generic injectables business partially offsetting these improvements were costs associated with manufacturing issues at the castlebar ireland facility and an increase in pension plan costs in 2011 as described below 

in addition to the colleague infusion pump and business optimization charges in 2010 the gross margin percentage in 2010 declined as a result of lower prices for certain plasma protein including antibody therapy products cost inefficiencies driven by lower volume throughput for plasmabased therapies and vaccines lower sales of high margin vaccines and healthcare reform in the united states and abroad these items were partially offset by improved sales mix across other product lines as well as a benefit from foreign currency 

refer to note 3 for further information regarding the divestiture and note 5 for further information regarding the colleague infusion pump charge 

marketing and administrative expenses 

the marketing and administrative expense ratio increased in both 2011 and 2010 the slight increase in the marketing and administrative expense ratio in 2011 was driven primarily by charges of 79 million related to the resolution of litigation pertaining to awp and certain rebate and discount adjustments related to historical price reporting submissions and 41 million principally related to a contribution to the baxter international foundation additionally the marketing and administrative expense ratio was impacted by the 192 million business optimization charge of which 97 million was recorded in marketing and administrative expenses in total these charges unfavorably impacted the marketing and administrative expense ratio by 16 percentage points in 2011 

the increase in the marketing and administrative expense ratio in 2010 was driven by the 588 million colleague infusion pump charge of which 213 million was recorded to sales the 257 million business optimization charge of which 125 million was recorded in marketing and administrative expenses and a 28 million charge to write down accounts receivable in greece in total these charges unfavorably impacted the marketing and administrative expense ratio by 15 percentage points in 2010 

the ratio in both years was favorably impacted by leverage from higher sales and the company’s continued focus on controlling discretionary spending offset by increased spending relating to certain marketing and promotional programs and increased pension plan costs as described below

pension plan costs 

fluctuations in pension plan costs impacted the company’s gross margin and expense ratios pension plan costs increased 53 million in 2011 and 15 million in 2010 as detailed in note 9 the increase in both 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to lower interest rates used to discount the plans’ projected benefit obligations and an increase in amortization of actuarial losses the increases in 2011 and 2010 were partially offset by cash contributions of 150 million and 350 million made to the pension plan in the united states in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

costs of the company’s pension plans are expected to increase from 223 million in 2011 to approximately 266 million in 2012 principally due to lower interest rates used to discount the plans’ projected benefit obligations a decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption and an increase in amortization of actuarial losses as of december 31 2011 the total actuarial loss that has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income increased to 21 billion from 18 billion as of december 31 2010 driven by prior years’ losses on plan assets and a decrease in the discount rate assumption for the us pension plan from 545 to 480 as a result the amortization of these deferred losses is expected to increase in 2012 to 208 million from 174 million in 2011 also contributing to the increase in the expected pension plan costs in 2012 is a reduction in the expected return on plan assets from 825 in 2011 to 775 in 2012 refer to note 9 for further information on the pension plans 

research and development 

 

 rd expenses increased in 2011 and decreased slightly in 2010 the increase in rd expenses in 2011 was driven by the company’s continued investment in a number of latestage rd programs across its product pipeline as described in additional detail in the strategic objectives section above also contributing to the increase in rd expenses in 2011 was the impact of foreign currency 

the reduction in rd expenses in 2010 was due to the completion of clinical work on latestage programs lower milestone payments to partners and efforts to reposition projects to gain organizational efficiencies partially offsetting the decrease in rd expense in 2010 was the impact of foreign currency rd expenses in 2010 included iprd charges totaling 34 million principally related to the licensing and acquisition of the hemophiliarelated intellectual property and other assets of archemix corp archemix refer to note 4 for more information regarding this transaction 

net interest expense 

net interest expense decreased 33 million and 11 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively principally due to an increase in interest income in both years also contributing to the decrease in net interest expense during 2011 was the impact of lower weightedaverage interest rates due to the maturity of baxter’s 475 500 million notes in october 2010 refer to note 2 for a summary of the components of net interest expense for the three years ended december 31 2011

bioscience pretax income increased 8 in 2011 and decreased 2 in 2010 during 2011 sales growth for certain higher margin products and improved margins on plasmabased therapies were partially offset by an increase in spending on new marketing and promotional programs also contributing to the increase in pretax income were lower inventory reserves related to vaccine products in 2011 

during 2010 sales growth for select higher margin products was more than offset by pricing pressures for certain plasma protein including antibody therapy products manufacturing cost inefficiencies for plasmabased therapies and vaccines the impact of healthcare reform and increased inventory reserves also contributing to the decline in pretax income was an expansion of certain sales resources and increased spending on new marketing and promotional programs 

medical products pretax income increased 128 in 2011 and decreased 37 in 2010 included in pretax income in 2010 were the first quarter 2010 charge of 588 million related to the recall of colleague infusion pumps from the us market the third quarter 2010 us multisource generic injectables business impairment charge of 112 million and the fourth quarter 2010 charge of 62 million related to litigation associated with the company’s 2008 recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the united states pretax income in 2011 benefited from sales growth for certain higher margin products which was partially offset by increased rd spending and costs associated with manufacturing issues at the company’s castlebar ireland facility 

the decrease in pretax income in 2010 due to the colleague infusion pump charge and the us multisource generic injectables business impairment charge was partially offset by sales growth across multiple product categories gross margin improvements a reduction in rd spending due to optimization efforts and the favorable impact of foreign currency

income taxes 

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate was 20 in 2011 25 in 2010 and 19 in 2009 the company anticipates that the effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with gaap will be approximately 22 in 2012 excluding any impact from additional audit developments or other special items 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives state and local taxes and foreign taxes that are different than the us federal statutory rate in addition as discussed further below the company’s effective income tax rate can be impacted in each year by discrete factors or events refer to note 10 for further information regarding the company’s income taxes 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 was principally due to a charge of 588 million in 2010 related to the recall of colleague infusion pumps from the us market for which there was no net tax benefit recognized a 39 million writeoff of a deferred tax asset in 2010 as a result of a change in the tax treatment of reimbursements under the medicare part d retiree prescription drug subsidy program under healthcare reform legislation enacted in the united states and 34 million of iprd charges in 2010 for which the tax benefit was lower than the us statutory rate also contributing to the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 were the tax benefits from the business optimization charge the awp litigation and historical price reporting charge and other charges in 2011 which were incurred in jurisdictions with rates higher than the effective rate these items were partially offset by the 2010 tax benefits from the us multisource generic injectables business impairment charge the business optimization charge and a charge related to litigation associated with the company’s 2008 recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the united states 

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was principally due to a 588 million charge related to the recall of colleague infusion pumps from the us market for which there was no tax benefit recognized a 39 million writeoff of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change in the tax treatment of reimbursements under the medicare part d retiree prescription drug subsidy program under healthcare reform legislation enacted in the united states a charge related to tax contingencies and 34 million of iprd charges for which the tax benefit was lower than the united states statutory rate these items were partially offset by the tax benefits from the us multisource generic injectables business impairment charge the business optimization charge and a charge related to litigation associated with the company’s 2008 recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the united states in addition to a change in the earnings mix from higher tax to lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year period 

the effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by greater income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates partially offset by 51 million of income tax benefit from the use of foreign tax losses 

uncertain tax positions 

baxter expects to reduce the amount of its liability for uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months by approximately 302 million due principally to the resolution of certain multijurisdictional transfer pricing issues and the resolution of tax contingencies in certain foreign jurisdictions while the final outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain the company believes it has made adequate tax provisions for all years subject to examination

 the increase in inventories in 2011 was principally due to higher workinprocess plasmarelated inventories in the bioscience segment as well as higher inventories of the sigma spectrum infusion pump in the medical products segment 

the lower inventory turns for the total company in 2011 were driven by the increase in inventories and were partially offset by the favorable impact of the 2011 business optimization charge of the total charge 95 million was recorded in costs of sales which favorably impacted total company turns by 015 the higher inventory turns for the total company in 2010 were driven by a reduction of plasmarelated inventories in the bioscience segment as well as the favorable impact of the 2010 business optimization charge of the total charge 132 million was recorded in cost of sales which increased total company turns by 023 refer to note 5 for further information regarding this charge

in 2011 the company refinanced its primary revolving credit facility agreement which was scheduled to mature in december 2011 the new credit facility has a maximum capacity of 15 billion and matures in june 2015 commitment fees under the new credit facility are not material the company also maintains a eurodenominated credit facility with a maximum capacity of approximately 396 million at december 31 2011 which matures in january 2013 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under any of the company’s facilities the company’s facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates determined in part by the company’s credit ratings and contain various covenants including a maximum netdebttocapital ratio at december 31 2011 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements the nonperformance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s respective commitment the company also maintains other credit arrangements as described in note 6 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the company had 29 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2011 with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives 

the company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece spain portugal and italy that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions as of december 31 2011 the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece spain portugal and italy totaled 524 million while the economic downturn has not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses the company recorded a charge of 28 million in the second quarter of 2010 to write down its accounts receivable in greece principally as a result of the greek government’s announcement of a plan to convert certain past due receivables into noninterest bearing bonds with maturities of one to three years the charge was computed by taking into consideration among other factors the imputed discount of the outstanding receivables based upon publically traded greek government bonds with similar terms and was included in marketing and administrative expenses global economic conditions governmental actions and customerspecific factors may require the company to reevaluate the collectibility and valuation of its receivables which could result in additional credit losses 

with respect to the greek government bonds the company collected 17 million in december 2011 upon the maturity of the first tranche of the bonds however as a result of continued economic uncertainty and ongoing greek government negotiations regarding the settlement terms for outstanding bonds the company recorded an impairment charge of 41 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reduce the remaining greek government bonds held by the company to estimated fair value the estimated fair value of these bonds was calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates observable inputs including interest rate yields 

  

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 there were no changes in the company’s credit ratings or outlook in 2011 

if baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be downgraded the company’s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted however any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt unless with respect to certain debt instruments preceded by a change in control of the company 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2011 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits payable or maturing in the following periods 

 

  

  

 the company contributed 251 million 416 million and 170 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively most of the company’s plans are funded the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables therefore the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows the pension plan balance included in other longterm liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled 13 billion at december 31 2011 

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements

financial instrument market risk 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 7 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real and colombian peso the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2011 is 18 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange 

  

rate established by the government on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of 215 relative to the us dollar the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential such as food and medicine was changed to 26 while the rate for payments for nonessential goods was changed to 43 in 2010 the majority of the company’s products imported into venezuela were classified as essential goods and qualified for the 26 rate effective january 1 2011 the venezuelan government devalued the official currency for imported goods classified as essential to 43 since january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company as of december 31 2011 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 28 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2011 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s total net sales 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 32 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 44 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 6 million would decrease by 41 million resulting in a net liability position 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2011 with exchange rates that are 10 unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 25 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2011 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2011 2010 and 2009 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

as discussed in note 7 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 

  

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate 

  

the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 9 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the measurement date december 31 2011 the company used a discount rate of 480 and 475 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively these discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2012 the company used a broad population of approximately 260 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2011 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 49 million 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2011 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 825 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2012 this assumption will decrease to 775 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations 

  

the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 20 million 

other assumptions 

the company used the rp 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 9 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 11 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at december 31 2011 total legal liabilities were 300 million and total related receivables were 145 million 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

  

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

acquired iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist intangible assets other than goodwill and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 for further information the company’s impairment 

  

reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and a market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options and significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant the company uses a monte carlo model for estimating the fair value of psus and significant inputs include the riskfree rate volatility of returns and correlation of returns refer to note 8 for additional information 

certain regulatory matters 

in july 2010 the fda issued a final order regarding the recall of the company’s colleague infusion pumps currently in use in the united states the company expects to complete the recall by july 2012 as discussed in note 5 the company has recorded a number of charges in connection with its colleague infusion pumps including related to the fda’s order and other actions the company is undertaking outside the united states it is possible that substantial additional cash and noncash charges including significant asset impairments related to the colleague infusion pumps and related businesses may be required in future periods based on new information changes in estimates the implementation of the recall in the united states and other actions the company may be required to undertake in markets outside of the united states

contractual arrangements 

 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the company’s ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or formed integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces 

 

competition and healthcare cost containment 

 

baxter’s bioscience medication delivery and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pd products as 

  well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medication delivery faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in renal global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the successful and timely implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products as our competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to our success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner obtain or maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness involve significant technical and business risks if we cannot adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis 

 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by the fda and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside the united states any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

 

we continue to address a number of regulatory issues as discussed further under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for 

  damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements 

 

the sales and marketing of our products and our relationships with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies the fda the oig the us department of justice doj and the federal trade commission have each increased their enforcement efforts including joint efforts with respect to the antikickback statute false claims act offlabel promotion of products other healthcare related laws antitrust and other competition laws the doj also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies the fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including the company from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain an improper advantage outside of the united states our business involves significant interaction with foreign officials the fcpa also imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on the company foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by our employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations refer to note 11 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of the requests that the company received in 2010 from certain federal government agencies 

 

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products 

 

our success depends upon the quality of our products quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the company’s products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins though great care is taken to assure the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

 

a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products in addition we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources we continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for such claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

  for more information on regulatory matters currently being addressed by the company refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

implementation of the fda order to recall our colleague infusion pumps in the united states may adversely affect our business 

 

pursuant to the consent decree entered into by the company in june 2006 the fda issued a final order in july 2010 regarding the recall of the company’s colleague infusion pumps currently in use in the united states the company is executing the recall over the two years following the final order by offering its customers an option to replace their colleague infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration under the replacement option the company’s customers may receive the sigma international general medical apparatus llc sigma spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their colleague infusion pumps for more information on the colleague recall refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the company cannot be certain that sigma will have sufficient production capacity to meet the demand for sigma spectrum infusion pumps customers choosing a refund or for whom sufficient replacement pumps are unavailable are likely to move to a competitive infusion pump platform many of the company’s colleague customers also purchase a variety of the company’s other medication delivery products if a significant number of colleague customers move to a competitive pump platform our business may suffer and sales of other products in the company’s medication delivery product portfolio may be adversely affected in addition it is possible that substantial additional cash and noncash charges including significant asset impairments related to the colleague infusion pumps and related businesses may be required in future periods based on new information changes in estimates the implementation of the recall in the united states and other actions the company may be required to undertake in markets outside the united states 

 

the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states may adversely affect our business 

 

the patient protection and affordable care act act which was signed into law in march 2010 includes several provisions which impact the company’s businesses in the united states including increased medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices the company will also be required to pay a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government beginning in 2011 and a 23 tax on certain of its medical devices beginning in 2013 the impact of the increased medicaid rebates and the expanded 340b drug pricing program is largely expected to impact the company’s bioscience business while the additional taxes are expected to impact each of the company’s business segments we may also experience downward pricing pressure as the act reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals while it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally additional regulations need to be established to implement many of the act’s provisions as a result the full impact of the act is uncertain 

 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified our business could suffer 

 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally as discussed above the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this effort we also face challenges including austerity measures being taken by governments in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls government controls in foreign markets also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to 

  sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverse to us further reductions in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants including gpos idns and other customers will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos idns or other customers are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

 

we face substantial competition and many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 

 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial rd and marketing resources than us competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial rd and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected 

 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

 

the nature of producing plasmabased products may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity 

 

the production of plasmabased products is a lengthy and complex process efforts to increase the collection of plasma may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities which can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process as a result our ability to match our collection and production of plasmabased products to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand of our plasmabased products or potentially an oversupply of inventory failure to meet market demand for our plasmabased products may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share in the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasmabased products close collection and processing facilities record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing difficulties our business may be adversely affected 

 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will continue to be successful in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

 

many of our products are difficult to manufacture this is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals or licenses 

 

some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that are subject to hurricanes earthquakes or other natural disasters loss or damage to a manufacturing facility could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise 

 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

  if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

as part of our longterm growth strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products our business financial condition and results could be adversely affected 

 

successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current and future products a failure to identify and take advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or discontinue low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

our operations both inside and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in exchange controls loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases nationalization increasingly complex labor environments expropriation and other governmental actions availability of raw materials changes in taxation including legislative changes in united states and international taxation of income earned outside of the united states importation limitations export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest or natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

 

in 2010 we generated approximately 60 of our revenue outside the united states we anticipate that revenue from outside the united states will continue to be significant as a result our financial results may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates market volatility and currency fluctuations may also reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our ability to costeffectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure governments may impose currency restrictions restricting our ability to manage our foreign currency exposure we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the venezuelan government is contained under the heading “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

  we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to accurately maintain the company’s books and records and provide information to the company’s management team important to the operation of the business the company’s erp has required and will continue to require the investment of significant human and financial resources we may not be able to successfully implement the erp without experiencing delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

 

we are subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

 

we are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including with respect to patent and product liability matters and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future see note 11 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding these lawsuits given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we cannot assure that the outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company 

 

current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and the business of our customers including their ability to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products

also unfavorably impacting the gross margin percentage in 2010 were lower prices for certain plasma protein including antibody therapy products cost inefficiencies driven by lower volume throughput for plasmabased therapies and vaccines lower sales of high margin vaccines increased inventory reserves and healthcare 

  reform in the united states and abroad these items were partially offset by improved sales mix across other product lines as well as a benefit from foreign currency 

 

the increase in gross margin in 2009 was principally driven by improvements in sales mix across all three segments manufacturing cost and yield improvements as well as improved pricing for select products contributing to the gross margin improvement was the continued customer conversion to advate therapy increased demand and improved pricing for gammagard liquid therapy and certain other plasma protein and nutritional products and increased demand for iv solutions global injectables and anesthesia products partially offsetting the gross margin improvement was the unfavorable impact of lower fsmeimmun vaccine revenues 

 

marketing and administrative expenses

costs of the company’s pension plans are expected to increase from 170 million in 2010 to approximately 220 million in 2011 principally due to lower interest rates used to discount the plans’ projected benefit obligations a decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption and an increase in loss amortization partially offset by the impact of 150 million of discretionary cash contributions made to the pension plan in the united states in january 2011 refer to note 9 for further information on the funding of pension plans for the domestic plans the discount rate will decrease to 545 from 605 and the expected return on plan assets will decrease to 825 from 85 for 2011

bioscience pretax income decreased 2 in 2010 and increased 5 in 2009 sales growth for select highermargin products in 2010 was more than offset by pricing pressures for certain plasma protein including antibody therapy products manufacturing cost inefficiencies for plasmabased therapies and vaccines the impact of healthcare reform and increased inventory reserves also contributing to the decline in pretax income was an expansion of certain sales resources and increased spending on new marketing and promotional programs 

 

the primary drivers of the increase in pretax income in 2009 were continued gross margin expansion driven by strong sales of highermargin products fueled principally by the continued customer adoption of advate therapy and increased demand and improved pricing for gammagard liquid therapy and certain other plasma protein products as well as continued manufacturing improvements partially offsetting the growth in 2009 was increased rd spending the unfavorable impact of lower fsmeimmun vaccine sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency

in 2008 the company terminated its remaining net investment hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment hedges of the net settlement payments in 2008 540 million of cash outflows were included as payments of obligations in the financing section and 12 million of cash inflows were included in the operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows the net aftertax losses related to net investment hedge instruments recorded in other comprehensive income were 33 million in 2008 

  contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2010 the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and contingent liabilities including contingent milestone payments associated with joint development and commercialization arrangements payable or maturing in the following periods 

 

 

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications for a discussion of the company’s significant offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 6 to 

  the consolidated financial statements regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications note 7 regarding receivable securitizations and note 11 regarding legal contingencies 

 

financial instrument market risk 

 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 7 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies 

 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real and colombian peso the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

 

the company may use options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december 31 2010 is 18 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies the company historically hedged certain of its net investments in international affiliates using a combination of debt denominated in foreign currencies and crosscurrency swap agreements as further discussed in note 7 in 2008 the company terminated all of its remaining net investment hedges 

 

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of 215 relative to the us dollar the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential such as food and medicine was changed to 26 while the rate for payments for nonessential goods was changed to 43 in 2010 the majority of the company’s products imported into venezuela were classified as essential goods and qualified for the 26 rate effective january 1 2011 the venezuelan government devalued the official currency for imported goods classified as essential to 43 since january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company as of december 31 2010 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 23 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2010 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s total net sales 

 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 6 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by 41 million resulting in a net liability position a similar analysis performed with respect to option forward and crosscurrency swap contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net liability balance of 69 million would increase by 69 million 

  the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2010 with exchange rates that are 10 unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 43 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2010 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

 

as discussed in note 7 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 

 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

changes in accounting standards 

 

refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements there have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during 2010 the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned specifically revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured the shipping terms for the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are fob destination the recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant postdelivery obligations such as training installation or other services 

 

the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers in these cases total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence tpe if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company uses its best estimate of selling prices 

 

provisions for discounts rebates to customers chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales these estimates are reviewed periodically and if necessary revised with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 

 

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations 

 

the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

 

pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

  the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 9 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the measurement date december 31 2010 the company used a discount rate of 545 and 540 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively this discount rate will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2011 the company used a broad population of approximately 260 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2010 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 37 million 

 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2010 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 850 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2011 this assumption will decrease to 825 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 17 million 

 

other assumptions 

the company used the retirement plan 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

  the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 9 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 11 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at december 31 2010 total legal liabilities were 170 million and total insurance receivables were 87 million 

 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

 

while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

 

inventories 

the company values its inventories at the lower of cost determined using the firstin firstout method or market value market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs and market value for work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable value the company reviews inventories on hand at least quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess slowmoving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value the regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand anticipated release of new products into the market either by the company or its competitors historical experience and product expiration uncertain timing of product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to inventory valuation additional inventory provisions may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its estimates are appropriate 

 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the 

  realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

 

fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities 

for financial assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs the majority of the derivatives entered into by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and blackscholes models the key inputs which are observable depend on the type of derivative and include contractual terms counterparty credit risk interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates and volatility refer to the financial instrument market risk section above for disclosures regarding sensitivity analyses performed by the company and note 7 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments 

 

in addition the company’s pension plan assets and contingent payments related to acquisitions and investments are valued at fair value on a recurring basis the valuation of pension assets which are recorded net of the plan’s liabilities depends on the type of security the plan holds principally the securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets or pricing matrices or models that incorporate observable market data inputs refer to the pension and opeb plans section above and note 9 for further information on the company’s pension plans contingent payments are valued using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects management’s expectations about probability of payment refer to note 4 for further information on the company’s contingent payments relating to acquisitions and investments 

 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

 

acquired iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

 

beginning in 2009 the company adopted a new accounting standard for accounting for business combinations under this accounting standard acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset and is no longer expensed at the time of the acquisition development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

  iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

 

impairment of assets 

goodwill is subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist intangible assets other than goodwill and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and a market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

 

stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs principally relate to awards of stock options and the significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields 

 

the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns in finalizing its assumptions the company also reviews comparable companies’ assumptions as available in published surveys and in publicly available financial filings 

 

the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed each period based on historical experience and current projections for the future 

 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense the fair value of an option is particularly impacted by the expected volatility and expected life assumptions to understand the impact of changes in these assumptions on the fair value of an option the company performs sensitivity analyses holding all other variables constant if the expected volatility assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in 2010 was increased by 100 basis points ie one percent the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately 4 from 1008 to 1052 holding all other variables constant including the expected volatility assumption if the expected life assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in 2010 was increased by one year the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately 8 from 1008 to 1090 

  the company also grants performance share units psus as part of its stock compensation program psus are earned by comparing the company’s growth in shareholder value relative to a performance peer group over a threeyear period based on the company’s relative performance the recipient of a psu may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant the fair value of a psu is estimated by the company at the grant date using a monte carlo model a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award the three primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the riskfree rate volatility of returns and correlation of returns the determination of the riskfree rate is similar to that described above relating to the valuation of stock options the expected volatility and correlation assumptions are based on historical information 

 

the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes the company’s assumptions are appropriate based upon the requirements of accounting standards for stock compensation and the company’s historical and expected future experience 

 

hedging activities 

as further discussed in note 7 and in the financial instrument market risk section above the company uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risks as baxter operates on a global basis there is a risk to earnings associated with foreign exchange relating to the company’s recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies compliance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities and the company’s hedging policies requires the company to make judgments regarding the probability of anticipated hedged transactions in making these estimates and assessments of probability the company analyzes historical trends and expected future cash flows and plans the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans if the company were to make different assessments of probability or make the assessments during a different fiscal period the company’s results of operations for a given period would be different 

 

certain regulatory matters 

 

in july 2005 the company stopped shipment of colleague infusion pumps in the united states following a number of class i recalls recalls at the highest priority level for the fda relating to the performance of the pumps as well as the seizure litigation described in note 11 the company entered into a consent decree in june 2006 additional class i recalls related to remediation and repair and maintenance activities were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009 pursuant to the consent decree in july 2010 the fda issued a final order regarding the recall of the company’s colleague infusion pumps currently in use in the united states the company is executing the recall over the two years following the final order by offering its customers an option to replace their colleague infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration under the replacement option the company’s customers may receive sigma spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their colleague infusion pumps alternatively colleague pump owners may receive the lesser of the pump’s depreciated value which will be no less than 1500 per singlechannel pump and 3000 per triplechannel pump or the purchase price the company will permit lessees to terminate their leases without penalty and will refund any prepaid unused lease portion upon the return of the devices as discussed in note 5 following the fda’s issuance of its initial order dated april 30 2010 the company recorded a charge in the first quarter of 2010 related to the fda’s order and other actions the company is undertaking outside the united states in addition to a number of earlier charges in connection with its colleague infusion pumps as discussed in note 11 the company received a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois relating to the colleague infusion pump in september 2009 it is possible that substantial additional cash and noncash charges including significant asset impairments related to the colleague infusion pumps and related businesses may be required in future periods based on new information changes in estimates the implementation of the recall in the united states and other actions the company may be required to undertake in markets outside of the united states 

 

in june 2010 the company received a warning letter from the fda in connection with an inspection of its renal business’s mcgaw park illinois headquarters facility the warning letter pertains to the processes by

for financial information about foreign and domestic operations and geographic information see “note 12 segment information” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

contractual arrangements 

 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or combined to form integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases 

 

competition 

 

baxter’s bioscience medication delivery and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

  although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medication delivery faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the multisource generics and anesthetics markets in renal global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been increasing consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

 

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks baxter will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including taking judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products for more information see “note 11 legal proceedings” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the successful and timely implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products as our competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to our success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy 

  customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner obtain andor maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness involve significant technical and business risks if we cannot adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis 

 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

 

the manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by the fda and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside the united states any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities we may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or proposed new products for a number of reasons failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

 

we continue to address a number of regulatory issues as discussed further under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required or that additional legislation or regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations third parties may also file claims against us in connection with these issues in addition sales of the related products may continue to be affected and sales of other baxter products may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address these issues 

 

the sales and marketing of our products and our relationships with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies the fda the oig the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission have each increased their enforcement efforts with respect to the antikickback statute false claims act offlabel promotion of products other healthcare related laws antitrust and other competition laws the doj has announced an increased focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare 

  providers and governments can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly we have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by our employees that violate these laws violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

issues with product quality could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

 

quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products in addition some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins though great care is taken to assure the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

 

a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products which may result in the loss of sales in addition we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources we continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

 

for more information on certain regulatory matters currently being addressed by the company with the fda please refer to “certain regulatory matters” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

changes in the healthcare regulatory environment including the pending healthcare reform being contemplated by the united states congress may adversely affect our business 

 

changes currently being contemplated in healthcare regulatory environments worldwide may restrict our operations or our growth congress is currently debating reforming the current healthcare system in the united states and the laws and regulations that will determine how that reform may be implemented some of the laws currently under debate may adversely affect the revenue generated by our products andor the taxes we pay these taxes may include a tax related to the sales or market share of our medical devices and drugs because each of our business units sell medical devices and drugs it is expected that each would be impacted by these proposed taxes in addition to possible increases in taxes there is a provision currently under consideration which is intended to expand the use of the “340b drug discount program” the 340b program provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchases of drugs for outpatient use it has been proposed that eligibility for these discounts be expanded to other entities and to the purchase of drugs for inpatient use these additional taxes and compulsory discounts if enacted may adversely affect our business by decreasing revenues and profits diminishing our ability to generate sufficient capital available for rd and forcing us to discontinue products that cannot support the increased tax or discount burden 

  none of the legislation described above has been enacted we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty what if any legislation will be enacted and if so what impact such legislation will ultimately have on our business 

 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified our business could suffer 

 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally as discussed above the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this effort we also face challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls government controls in foreign markets also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverse to us any reduction in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants including gpos idns and other customers will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos idns or other customers are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

 

we face substantial competition and many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 

 

although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial rd and marketing resources than us competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial rd and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected 

 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

  if we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis our business may be adversely affected 

 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will continue to be successful in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries we cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques or that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to establish an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to record asset impairment charges 

  if we are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products our business financial condition and results could be adversely affected 

 

successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current and future products a failure to identify and take advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or discontinue low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

our operations both inside and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in exchange controls loss of business in government tenders that are held annually in many cases nationalization increasingly complex labor environments expropriation and other governmental actions availability of raw materials changes in taxation including legislative changes in united states and international taxation of income earned outside of the united states importation limitations export control restrictions changes in or violations of us or local laws including the fcpa dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political destabilization or instability disputes between countries diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest or natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

 

in 2009 we generated approximately 60 of our revenue outside the united states we anticipate that revenue from outside the united states will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue as a result our financial results may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates market volatility and currency fluctuations may also reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our ability to costeffectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading “financial instrument market risk” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

 

challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit rating current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and the business of our customers including their ability to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt or common stock the company had 28 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2009 the company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions 

  the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions however the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility in the future to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives 

 

while the current economic downturn has not meaningfully impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables the company continues to do business with certain foreign governments which have recently experienced credit rating downgrades and may become unable to pay for the company’s products or services 

 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings at december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

there were no changes to the company’s credit ratings in 2009 

 

if baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be downgraded the company’s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted however any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt unless with respect to certain debt instruments preceded by a change in control of the company 

 

net investment hedges 

in 2008 the company terminated its remaining net investment hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment hedges the company historically hedged the net assets of certain of its foreign operations using a combination of foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps in 2004 the company reevaluated its net investment hedge strategy and elected to reduce the use of these instruments as a risk management tool as part of the change in strategy the company executed offsetting or mirror crosscurrency swaps relating to over half of the existing portfolio that effectively fixed the net amount that the company would ultimately pay to settle the crosscurrency swap agreements subject to this strategy the net aftertax losses related to net investment hedge instruments recorded in other comprehensive income were 33 million and 48 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

when the crosscurrency swaps are settled the cash flows are reported within the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows when the mirror swaps are settled the cash flows are reported in the operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows of the 528 million of net settlement payments in 2008 540 million of cash outflows were included in the financing section and 12 million of cash inflows were included in the operating section of the 334 million of settlement payments in 2007 303 million of cash outflows were included in the financing section and 31 million of cash outflows were included in the operating section

offbalance sheet arrangements 

baxter periodically enters into offbalance sheet arrangements where economical and consistent with the company’s business strategy certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments also upon resolution of uncertainties the company may incur 

  charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications the following is a summary of significant offbalance sheet arrangements and contingencies 

 

receivable securitizations 

where economical the company has entered into agreements with various financial institutions in which the entire interest in and ownership of the receivable is sold principally consisting of trade receivables originated in japan the company had also entered into agreements in which undivided interests in certain pools of receivables were sold principally consisting of hardware lease receivables originated in the united states and trade receivables originated in europe refer to note 7 for a description of these arrangements the japanese securitization arrangement includes limited recourse provisions which are not material to the consolidated financial statements 

 

joint development and commercialization arrangements 

in the normal course of business baxter enters into joint development and commercialization arrangements with third parties sometimes with companies in which the company has invested the arrangements vary but generally provide that baxter will receive certain rights to manufacture market or distribute a specified technology or product under development in exchange for upfront payments and contingent payments relating to the achievement of specified preclinical clinical regulatory approval or sales milestones at december 31 2009 the unfunded milestone payments under these arrangements totaled 812 million this total excludes any contingent royalties based on the company’s projections any contingent payments made in the future will be more than offset over time by the estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired for those payments the majority of the contingent payments relate to arrangements in the bioscience segment refer to note 6 for further information 

 

indemnifications 

during the normal course of business baxter makes indemnities commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be required to make payments related to specific transactions indemnifications include i intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use sale or license of products and services ii indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises iii indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and iv indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts in addition under baxter’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and consistent with delaware general corporation law the company has agreed to indemnify its directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the occurrence of prescribed events the majority of these indemnities commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the company could be obligated to make to help address some these risks the company maintains various insurance coverages based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements the company does not believe that any significant payments related to its indemnifications will result and therefore the company has not recorded any associated liabilities 

 

legal contingencies 

refer to note 11 for a discussion of the company’s legal contingencies upon resolution of any of these uncertainties the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities while the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

  funding of pension and other postemployment benefit plans 

the company’s funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding requirements the company is not legally obligated to fund its principal plans in the united states and puerto rico in 2010 the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of at least 335 million in 2010 which includes a 300 million discretionary cash contribution made to its pension plan in the united states in january 2010 the company expects to have net cash outflows relating to its other postemployment benefit opeb plan of approximately 25 million in 2010 

 

the table below details the funded status percentage of the company’s pension plans as of december 31 2009 including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of the company’s funding policy outlined above the table excludes the 300 million discretionary cash contribution made to the pension plan in the united states in january 2010 refer to note 9 for further information 

 

 

 

the pension protection act of 2006 ppa was signed into law on august 17 2006 it is likely that the ppa will accelerate minimum funding requirements in the future 

 

insurance coverage 

the company discontinued its practice of buying product liability insurance coverage effective may 1 2007 the unavailability of insurance coverage with meaningful limits at a reasonable cost reflects current trends in product liability insurance for healthcare manufacturing companies generally the company continues to evaluate available coverage levels and costs as market conditions change the company’s net income and cash flows may be adversely affected in the future as a result of losses sustained 

 

financial instrument market risk 

 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and shareholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates the company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs refer to note 7 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies 

 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real and colombian peso the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets in addition the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility relating to foreign exchange financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the company’s ability to costeffectively hedge these exposures 

 

the company uses options forwards and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted 

  transactions at december 31 2009 is 12 months the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies the company historically hedged certain of its net investments in international affiliates using a combination of debt denominated in foreign currencies and crosscurrency swap agreements as further discussed in note 7 in 2008 the company terminated all of its remaining net investment hedges 

 

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and requires such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of 215 relative to the us dollar the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential such as food and medicine was changed to 26 while the rate for payments for nonessential goods was changed to 43 the company expects that the majority of its products imported into venezuela will be classified as essential goods and qualify for the 26 rate the 43 rate was used for the translation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary at december 31 2009 because this is the rate at which dividends are expected to be remitted if and when such dividends are approved by the venezuelan government as of january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result the functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela will be the us dollar the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary is not expected to have a material impact on the financial results of the company as of december 31 2009 the company’s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of 20 million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar in 2009 net sales in venezuela represented less than 1 of baxter’s total net sales 

 

as part of its riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible nearterm movements in foreign exchange rates 

 

a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option forward and crosscurrency swap contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 while not predictive in nature indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by 10 against all currencies on a netoftax basis the net liability balance of 69 million with respect to those contracts which principally related to a hedge of us dollardenominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary would increase by 69 million a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2008 indicated that on a netoftax basis the net asset balance of 40 million would decrease by 65 million resulting in a net liability position 

 

the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option forward and crosscurrency swap contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 by replacing the actual exchange rates at december 31 2009 with exchange rates that are 10 unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency all other factors are held constant these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 

 

interest rate and other risks 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floatingrate debt that the company believes is appropriate to manage this mix in a costefficient manner the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional amount the company also periodically uses forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 

 

as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 52 basispoint increase in interest 

  rates approximately 10 of the company’s weightedaverage interest rate during 2009 affecting the company’s financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives would have an immaterial effect on the company’s 2009 2008 and 2007 earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 

 

as discussed in note 7 the fair values of the company’s longterm litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information a 10 movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 

 

with respect to the company’s investments in affiliates the company believes any reasonably possible nearterm losses in earnings cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

changes in accounting standards 

 

business combinations 

on january 1 2009 the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of significant respects the key changes include the expansion of transactions that qualify as business combinations the capitalization of iprd as an indefinitelived asset the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value the expensing of acquisition costs the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the acquired company the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date the recognition of postacquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax expense or benefit and the expansion of disclosure requirements this standard was applicable for acquisitions made by the company on or after january 1 2009 including the april 2009 consolidation of sigma and the august 2009 acquisition of certain assets of edwards crrt refer to note 4 for further information regarding sigma and edwards crrt 

 

noncontrolling interests 

on january 1 2009 the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests historically referred to as minority interests the standard requires that noncontrolling interests be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity but separate from baxter shareholders’ equity and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to baxter and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statements of income any losses in excess of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest continue to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions upon a loss of control the interest sold as well as any interest retained is measured at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings in partial acquisitions when control is obtained 100 of the assets and liabilities including goodwill are recognized at fair value as if the entire target company had been acquired the new standard was applied prospectively as of january 1 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which have been applied retrospectively for prior periods presented prior to the adoption of the new standard the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income was included in other expense net in the consolidated statements of income and the noncontrolling interests’ equity was included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the accounting related provisions of the new accounting standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two updates to the accounting standards codification related to revenue recognition the first update eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have been delivered the update also no longer allows 

  use of the residual method when allocating consideration to deliverables instead arrangement consideration is to be allocated to deliverables using the relative selling price method applying a selling price hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price should be used if it exists otherwise third party evidence tpe of selling price should be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company’s best estimate of selling price should be used the second update eliminates tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance when the tangible products contain software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality both updates require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 with prospective application for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospective application permitted early adoption is permitted the same transition method and period of adoption must be used for both updates the company adopted these updates in 2009 prospectively applying them to arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january 1 2009 the early adoption of these updates did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and did not result in a change in its previously reported quarterly consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 1 certain of the company’s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company’s financial statements and require significant difficult or complex judgments by the company often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results that differ from the company’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements there have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during 2009 the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances 

the company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned specifically revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured the shipping terms for the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are fob destination the recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant postdelivery obligations such as training installation or other services 

 

the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers in these cases total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy selling prices are determined using vsoe if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using tpe if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company uses its best estimate of selling prices 

 

provisions for discounts rebates to customers chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded and are reflected as a reduction of sales these estimates are reviewed periodically and if necessary revised with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 

 

the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the reserve the company considers historical credit losses the pastdue status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information and any other relevant factors or considerations because of the nature of the company’s customer base and the company’s credit and collection policies and procedures writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically not been significant generally less than 2 of gross receivables 

  the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable which is at the time the related revenue is recognized the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information estimates of future costs under the company’s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves but believes presently established reserves are adequate 

 

pension and opeb plans 

the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee’s compensation expense the valuation of the funded status and net benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate the significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both shortterm and longterm historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost actual results in the future could differ from expected results the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its assumptions are appropriate 

 

the company’s key assumptions are listed in note 9 the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees because these plans are the most significant to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

discount rate assumption 

for the us and puerto rico plans at the measurement date december 31 2009 the company used a discount rate of 605 and 595 to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan respectively this discount rate will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2010 the company used a broad population of approximately 260 aarated corporate bonds as of december 31 2009 to determine the discount rate assumption all bonds were denominated in us dollars with a minimum amount outstanding of 50 million this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 moody’s aa rated noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 

 

for plans in canada japan the united kingdom and the eurozone the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans for the company’s other international plans the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and regionspecific government and corporate bond interest rates 

 

to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point ie onehalf of one 

  percent increase decrease in the discount rate global pretax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 32 million 

 

return on plan assets assumption 

in measuring net periodic cost for 2009 the company used a longterm expected rate of return of 85 for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees this assumption will also be used to measure net pension cost for 2010 this assumption is not applicable to the company’s opeb plan because it is not funded 

 

the company establishes the longterm asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns both companyspecific and relating to the broad market based on the company’s asset allocation as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company’s actual and targeted asset allocation in calculating net pension cost the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 

 

to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost the company performs a sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant for each 50 basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption global pretax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately 15 million 

 

other assumptions 

the company used the retirement plan 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico for all other pension plans the company utilized country and regionspecific mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit obligations the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 

 

the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience market trends and anticipated future company actions refer to note 9 for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 

 

legal contingencies 

the company is involved in product liability patent commercial regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 11 for further information the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate the minimum amount in the range is accrued if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no liability is recorded the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at december 31 2009 total legal liabilities were 112 million and total insurance receivables were 96 million 

 

the company’s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries after completing the assessment and accounting for the company’s legal contingencies the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected in performing the assessment the company reviews available information including historical companyspecific and market collection experience for similar claims current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies and other relevant information 

  while the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters litigation is inherently uncertain excessive verdicts do occur and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 

 

inventories 

the company values its inventories at the lower of cost determined using the firstin firstout method or market value market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs and market value for work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable value the company reviews inventories on hand at least quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess slowmoving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value the regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand anticipated release of new products into the market either by the company or its competitors historical experience and product expiration uncertain timing of product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to inventory valuation additional inventory provisions may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes its estimates are appropriate 

 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions 

the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in the company’s tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 

 

in the normal course of business the company is audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company believes the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap based on the technical support for the positions the company’s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters the company’s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if upon final resolution with taxing authorities the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

 

fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities 

on january 1 2008 the company adopted the new accounting standard for financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and on january 1 2009 the company adopted the new accounting standard for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

 

for assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs the majority of the derivatives entered into by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and blackscholes models the key inputs which are observable depend on the type of derivative and 

  include contractual terms counterparty credit risk interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates and volatility refer to the financial instrument market risk section above for disclosures regarding sensitivity analyses performed by the company and note 7 for further information regarding the company’s financial instruments 

 

in addition the company’s pension plan assets and contingent payments associated with business combinations are valued at fair value on a recurring basis the valuation of pension assets which are recorded net of the plan’s liabilities depends on the type of security the plan holds principally the securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets or pricing matrices or models that incorporate observable market data inputs refer to the pension and opeb plans section above and note 9 for further information on the company’s pension plans contingent payments are valued using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects management’s expectations about probability of payment refer to note 4 for further information on the company’s contingent payments relating to acquisitions 

 

valuation of intangible assets including iprd 

the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset including consideration of technical legal regulatory economic and other factors each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 

 

acquired iprd is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 

 

beginning in 2009 as discussed further above the company adopted a new accounting standard for accounting for business combinations under the new accounting standard acquired iprd included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset and is no longer expensed at the time of the acquisition development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product the indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life if the rd project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense 

 

iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately for such transactions payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

 

due to the inherent uncertainty associated with rd projects there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses nor that the rd project will result in a successful commercial product 

 

impairment of assets 

goodwill is subject to impairment reviews annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist intangible assets other than goodwill and other longlived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable refer to note 1 for further information the company’s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans and a market participant’s views of the company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company’s results of operations actual results may differ from the company’s estimates 

  stockbased compensation plans 

stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment the company’s stock compensation costs principally relate to awards of stock options and the significant assumptions include longterm projections regarding stock price volatility employee exercise postvesting termination and prevesting forfeiture behaviors interest rates and dividend yields 

 

the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options the company’s expected volatility assumption is based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of baxter’s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns in finalizing its assumptions the company also reviews comparable companies’ assumptions as available in published surveys and in publicly available financial filings 

 

the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed each period based on historical experience and current projections for the future 

 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense the fair value of an option is particularly impacted by the expected volatility and expected life assumptions to understand the impact of changes in these assumptions on the fair value of an option the company performs sensitivity analyses holding all other variables constant if the expected volatility assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in 2009 was increased by 100 basis points ie one percent the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately 3 from 1168 to 1207 holding all other variables constant including the expected volatility assumption if the expected life assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in 2009 was increased by one year the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately 8 from 1168 to 1261 

 

the company began granting performance share units psus in 2007 psus are earned by comparing the company’s growth in shareholder value relative to a performance peer group over a threeyear period based on the company’s relative performance the recipient of a psu may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant the fair value of a psu is estimated by the company at the grant date using a monte carlo model a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award the three primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the riskfree rate volatility of returns and correlation of returns the determination of the riskfree rate is similar to that described above relating to the valuation of stock options the expected volatility and correlation assumptions are based on historical information 

 

the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results but believes the company’s assumptions are appropriate based upon the requirements of accounting standards for stock compensation and the company’s historical and expected future experience 

 

hedging activities 

as further discussed in note 7 and in the financial instrument market risk section above the company uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risks as baxter operates on a global basis there is a risk to earnings associated with foreign exchange relating to the company’s recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies compliance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities and the company’s hedging policies require the company to make judgments regarding the 

  probability of anticipated hedged transactions in making these estimates and assessments of probability the company analyzes historical trends and expected future cash flows and plans the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company’s business plans if the company were to make different assessments of probability or make the assessments during a different fiscal period the company’s results of operations for a given period would be different 

 

new accounting standards 

 

transfers of financial assets 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard relating to the accounting for transfers of financial assets the new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity and clarifies existing gaap as it relates to determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets the standard limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or portion of a financial asset should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements presented andor when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset the standard also requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 with early adoption prohibited the new standard will be applied prospectively except for the disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented the new standard which is effective for the company as of january 1 2010 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

variable interest entities 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new standard that changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies the new standard requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the standard requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises with a variable interest in a vie it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 with early adoption prohibited the new standard which is effective for the company as of january 1 2010 is not expected to have material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

certain regulatory matters 

 

in july 2005 the company stopped shipment of colleague infusion pumps in the united states following a number of class i recalls recalls at the highest priority level for the fda relating to the performance of the pumps as well as the seizure litigation described in note 11 the company entered into a consent decree in june 2006 additional class i recalls related to remediation and repair and maintenance activities were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009 the consent decree provides for reviews of the company’s facilities processes and controls by the company’s outside expert followed by the fda in december 2007 following the outside expert’s review the fda conducted inspections and remains in a dialogue with the company as discussed in note 11 the company received a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney of the northern district of illinois relating to the colleague infusion pump in september 2009 as discussed in note 5 the company has recorded a number of charges in connection with its colleague infusion pumps it is possible that substantial additional charges including significant asset impairments related to colleague may be required in future periods based on new information changes in estimates and modifications to the current remediation plan 

 

in the first quarter of 2008 the company identified an increasing level of allergictype and hypotensive adverse reactions occurring in patients using its heparin sodium injection products in the united states the company initiated a field corrective action with respect to the products however due to users’ needs for the 

  products the company and the fda concluded that public health considerations warranted permitting selected dosages of the products to remain in distribution for use where medically necessary until alternate sources became available in the quarter at which time the company’s products were removed from distribution 

 

in january 2010 the company received a warning letter from the fda regarding observations made by the agency following inspections of the company’s manufacturing facility in lessines belgium the warning letter identifies a number of issues associated with certain fill and finish processes and controls relating to gammagard liquid therapy the company is working with the fda to address these issues 

 

while the company continues to work to resolve the issues described above there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of any other product may not be adversely affected or that additional legislation or regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations please see “item 1a risk factors” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of regulatory matters

international markets 

 

baxter generates approximately 60 of its revenues outside the united states while healthcare cost containment continues to be a focus around the world demand for healthcare products and services continues 

to be strong worldwide the company’s strategies emphasize global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical care worldwide baxter’s operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in exchange controls loss of business in government tenders nationalization increasingly complex labor environments expropriation and other governmental actions changes in taxation importation limitations export control restrictions violations of us or local laws dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic destabilization instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers 

 

financial information about foreign and domestic operations and geographic information is incorporated by reference from the section entitled “notes to consolidated financial statements — note 12 segment information” of the annual report 

 

contractual arrangements 

 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices in the case of hospitals and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer 

 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or combined to form integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states gpos may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter at times may experience shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

 

the company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases 

 

competition 

 

baxter’s medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the bioscience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships the renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medication delivery faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the multisource generics and anesthetics markets in renal global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers in the united states many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and latin america for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter relies on trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

 

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks baxter will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate 

 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products 

 

research and development 

 

baxter’s investment in research and development is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain competitive in all three of its business segments accordingly baxter continues to increase its investment in 

research and development programs to develop innovative products systems and manufacturing methods expenditures for baxter’s research and development activities were 868 million in 2008 760 million in 2007 and 614 million in 2006 these expenditures include costs associated with research and development activities performed at the company’s research and development centers located around the world which include facilities in austria belgium japan and the united states as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for research and development work performed at nonbaxter locations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

 

 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the successful and timely implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products as baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and costeffectiveness involve significant technical and business risks if we cannot adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both within and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities both within and outside the united states any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities we may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or proposed new products for a number of reasons failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

 

we continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as discussed further under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in “management’s discussion and analysis” of the annual report in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required or that additional legislation or regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations third parties may also file claims against us in connection with these pump issues in addition sales of these products may continue to be affected and sales of other baxter products may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address these pump issues 

 

in addition the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth the healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 

 

 

failure to provide quality products and services to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

 

quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management while baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relates to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products in addition some of the raw materials employed in baxter’s production processes are derived from human and animal origins though great care is taken to assure the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants 

 

a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products which may result in losses of sales in addition we may be named as a defendant in product 

liability lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

 

in 2008 we removed our heparin sodium injection products from distribution in the united states after identifying an increasing level of allergictype and hypotensive adverse reactions occurring in certain patients for more information on this recall and the lawsuits we face in connection with this recall please refer to “certain regulatory matters” in “management’s discussion and analysis” of the annual report and “notes to consolidated financial statements — note 11 legal proceedings” of the annual report 

 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified our business could suffer 

 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been targeted in this effort we also face challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls government controls in foreign markets also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverse to us any reduction in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient components andor raw materials on a timely basis our business may be adversely affected 

 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will continue to be successful in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales 

 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants including gpos idns and other customers will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos idns or other customers are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and 

in other countries we cannot assure that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

 

the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques or that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

 

 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to establish an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to record asset impairment charges 

 

 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products our business financial condition and results could be adversely affected 

 

successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current and future products a failure to identify and take advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or discontinue low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

we face substantial competition and many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial research and development and marketing resources than baxter competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial research and development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly 

to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected 

 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

 

 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

our operations both within and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in exchange controls loss of business in government tenders that are held annually in many cases nationalization increasingly complex labor environments expropriation and other governmental actions changes in taxation including legislative changes in united states and international taxation of income earned outside of the united states importation limitations export control restrictions violations of us or local laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic destabilization instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest or natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations including the fcpa could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

 

in 2008 we generated approximately 60 of our revenue outside the united states our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates especially in light of recent market volatility and drastic movements in currency exchange rates these conditions may also reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our ability to costeffectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure a discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading “financial instrument market risk” contained in “management’s discussion and analysis” of the annual report we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

 

 

current challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

the global financial markets have recently experienced unprecedented levels of volatility the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions while these conditions and the current economic downturn have not meaningfully impaired our ability to access credit markets or meaningfully adversely affected our operations to date continuing volatility in the global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect the company’s ability to access the capital markets current or worsening economic conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers including their ability to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products

financial information about baxter’s segments and principal product lines is incorporated by reference from the section entitled “notes to consolidated financial statements — note 12 segment information” of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2007 

 

sales and distribution 

 

the company has its own sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies in the united states 

  cardinal health inc warehouses and ships a significant portion of the company’s products through its distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

 

international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent local distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries international subsidiaries employ their own field sales forces in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china colombia the czech republic denmark ecuador finland france germany greece guatemala india italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new zealand norway panama the philippines poland portugal russia singapore spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and venezuela 

 

contractual arrangements 

 

substantial portions of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states many of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on price increases in the case of hospitals and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer over the years there has been consolidation in our customer base and as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex 

 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the united states and in other countries have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or combined to form integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states some of these gpos have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter has at times experienced shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

 

in some situations the company has longterm supply contracts with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases 

 

some of the raw materials employed in baxter’s production processes are derived from human and animal origins though great care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents 

 

as is common in new technologies including biotechnology the precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less mature than in other industries this can have a potential impact on the ability to produce product at the quality standards baxter adheres to and within baxter’s cost expectations 

  competition 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market share pressures 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and some other markets for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

 

baxter faces competition from global and regional companies both large and small in each of the markets in which it participates bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medication delivery faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the multisource generics and anesthetics markets in renal global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels 

 

baxter’s medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical companies the bioscience business benefits from a number of competitive advantages such as continued innovation of products and services consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships baxter’s renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturer of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter also relies on trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

 

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the 

  greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks baxter will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers 

 

baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that baxter patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company generally is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectualproperty related actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products 

 

research and development 

 

baxter’s investment in research and development is essential to its future growth accordingly baxter is increasing its investment in research and development programs to develop innovative products systems and manufacturing methods expenditures for baxter’s research and development activities were 760 million in 2007 614 million in 2006 and 533 million in 2005 these expenditures include costs associated with research and development activities performed at the company’s research and development centers located around the world including facilities in austria belgium france japan and the united states as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for research and development work performed at nonbaxter locations 

 

principal areas of strategic focus for research and development include recombinant therapeutics adult stemcell therapy plasmabased therapeutics initiatives in regenerative medicine small molecule drugs enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery kidney dialysis drug formulation technologies and sterilization technologies the company’s research efforts emphasize selfmanufactured product development and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines baxter supplements its own research and development efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into development agreements with third parties for example baxter is involved in partnerships with both nektar therapeutics and lipoxen technologies to leverage each company’s expertise in developing longeracting factor xiii and factor ix therapies to reduce the frequency of injections required to treat bloodclotting disorders 

 

baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the company’s research and development efforts are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its business segments the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including the company’s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate its products from those of its competitors 

 

quality management 

 

baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to its customers quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the company’s business units and facilities which relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the company’s products to assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements the company regularly reviews its quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers of raw materials components and finished goods in addition the company conducts quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services 

 

from time to time the company may determine that products manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company specifications published standards such as those issued by the international standards 

  organization or regulatory requirements when a quality issue is identified baxter investigates such issue and takes appropriate corrective action such as withdrawal of the product from the market correction of the product at the customer location notice to the customer of revised labeling and other actions for more information on corrective actions taken by baxter please refer to our discussion under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in “management’s discussion and analysis” of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2007

environmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection 

 

international markets 

 

baxter generates more than 55 of its revenues outside the united states while healthcare cost containment continues to be a focus around the world demand for healthcare products and services continues to be strong worldwide particularly in developing markets the company’s strategies emphasize global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical care worldwide international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states such as changes in currency exchange rates price and currency exchange controls import restrictions dependence on a few governmental entities as customers loss of business in governmental tenders that are held annually in many cases nationalization expropriation and other governmental action violations of us or local laws as well as volatile economic social and political conditions in certain countries

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the successful and timely implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success and involve significant technical and business risks if we cannot adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis 

 

if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources our success developing products from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to establish an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and its ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to record asset impairment charges 

 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or products our business financial condition and results could be adversely affected 

 

successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current and future products a failure to identify and take advantage of opportunities which allow us to increase our profit margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or 

  terminate low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous governmental agencies both within and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities both within and outside the united states any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities we may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or proposed new products for a number of reasons failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

 

we continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as discussed further under the caption entitled “certain regulatory matters” in “management’s discussion and analysis” of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2007 there can be no assurance that we will resolve these pump issues without incurring additional charges or facing any of the sanctions available to the fda under the consent decree entered into with the fda concerning our infusion pumps third parties may file claims against us in connection with these pump issues in addition sales of these products may continue to be affected and sales of related products may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address these pump issues 

 

in addition the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth the healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 

 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified our business could suffer 

 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been targeted in this effort we also face challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time including in ways that are adverse to us any reduction in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

  if we are unable to obtain sufficient components andor raw materials on a timely basis our business may be adversely affected 

 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will continue to be successful in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost effective manner and our ability to make product sales 

 

failure to provide quality products and services to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services while baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relates to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals in addition we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants including gpos and idns will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos or idns are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

 

if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the united states and in other countries the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

  we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

 

we face substantial competition and many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial research and development and marketing resources than baxter competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial research and development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected 

 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer 

 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

our operations both within and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates nationalization expropriation and other governmental actions importation limitations violations of us or local laws dependence on a few governmental entities as customers loss of business in governmental tenders that are held annually in many cases pricing restrictions economic destabilization instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest or natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease

financial information about baxter’s segments and principal product lines is incorporated by reference from the section entitled “notes to consolidated financial statements — note 11 segment information” of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2006 which is filed as exhibit 13 to this report on form 10k 

 

sales and distribution 

 

the company has its own sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies in the united states cardinal health inc cardinal health warehouses and ships a significant portion of the company’s products through its distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate 

  prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising 

 

international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent local distributors in more than 100 countries international subsidiaries employ their own field sales forces in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china colombia the czech republic denmark ecuador finland france germany greece guatemala india italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new zealand norway panama peru the philippines poland portugal russia singapore spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and venezuela in other countries sales are made through independent distributors or sales agents 

 

contractual arrangements 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states many of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on price increases in the case of hospitals clinical laboratories and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery some hospitals and other customers of medical products have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or combined to form integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members there has been consolidation in our customer base as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex the enhanced purchasing power of these customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

 

baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states some of these gpos have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter baxter’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos or idns are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter has at times experienced occasional shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

 

in some situations the company has longterm supply contracts with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases 

 

some of the raw materials employed in baxter’s production processes are derived from human and animal origins though every care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents baxter believes the production processes that employ these materials adequately eliminate or inactivate infectious or toxic elements that may be present in these raw materials 

 

as is common in new technologies including biotechnology the precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less mature than in other industries this can have a potential impact on the ability to produce product at the quality standards baxter adheres to and within baxter’s cost expectations 

   

competition 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations mcos in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products mcos seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and some other markets for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

 

baxter faces competition from global and regional companies both large and small in each of the markets in which it participates bioscience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical biotechnology and other companies medication delivery faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the multisource generics and inhaled anesthetics markets in renal global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels 

 

baxter’s medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and acute care facilities customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical companies the bioscience business benefits from a number of competitive advantages such as continued innovation of products and services consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships baxter’s renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturer of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter also relies on trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

   

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks baxter will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers 

 

baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that baxter patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

 

baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company generally is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectualproperty related actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products 

 

research and development 

 

baxter’s investment in research and development is essential to its future growth accordingly baxter is increasingly engaged in research and development programs to develop innovative products systems and manufacturing methods expenditures for baxter’s research and development activities relating to continuing operations were 614 million in 2006 533 million in 2005 and 517 million in 2004 these activities are performed at research and development centers located around the world including facilities in austria belgium france japan and the united states 

 

principal areas of strategic focus for research and development include recombinant therapeutics adult stemcell therapy plasmabased therapeutics biosurgery products small molecule drugs enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery kidney dialysis drug formulation technologies and sterilization technologies the company’s research efforts emphasize selfmanufactured product development and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines baxter supplements its own research and development efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into development agreements with third parties for example baxter is involved in partnerships with both nektar therapeutics and lipoxen technologies to leverage each company’s expertise in developing new therapies to reduce the frequency of injections required to treat bloodclotting disorders 

 

baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the company’s research and development efforts are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its business segments the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including the company’s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate its products from those of its competitors 

 

quality management 

 

baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to its customers quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the company’s business units and facilities which relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the company’s products to assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements the company regularly reviews its quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers of raw materials components and finished goods in addition the company conducts quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services

the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success if we cannot adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 

 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities in which to invest or if we are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or products our business financial condition and results could be adversely affected 

 

successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current and future products a failure to identify and take advantage of opportunities which allow us to increase our profit margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or terminate low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with certain of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 

 

as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous governmental agencies both within and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are ourselves subject to these laws and regulations and is also indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

   

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities we may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or proposed new products for a number of reasons failure to comply with the requirements of the fda could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of the government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales 

 

we continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as discussed further under the caption entitled “colleague matter” in “management’s discussion and analysis” of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2006 there can be no assurance that we will resolve these pump issues without incurring additional charges or facing any of the sanctions available to the fda under the consent decree entered into with the united states concerning our infusion pumps third parties may file claims against us in connection these pump issues in addition our sales of other products may be adversely affected if we experience a loss of customer confidence as a result of these pump issues 

 

in addition the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth the healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 

 

if reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified our business would suffer 

 

sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these health care management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been targeted in this effort we also face challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time including in ways that are adverse to us any reduction in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

failure to provide quality products and services to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management we place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services while baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in any of the actions described in the first paragraph above in addition we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

   

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 

 

if we are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary rights or infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged 

 

patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the us and in other countries the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

 

we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

 

we have many competitors several of which have significantly greater financial and other resources 

 

although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial research and development and marketing resources than baxter competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial research and development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected 

 

we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 

   

we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 

 

our operations both within and outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies these risks include possible nationalization expropriation importation limitations violations of us or local laws pricing restrictions and other restrictive governmental actions or economic destabilization instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease also fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial results

  baxter international inc was incorporated under delaware law in 1931 as used in this report except as otherwise indicated in information incorporated by reference “baxter international” means baxter international inc and “baxter” or the “company” means baxter international and its subsidiaries 

business segments 

  the medication delivery bioscience and renal segments comprise baxter’s continuing operations unless otherwise indicated each of the factors discussed in part i do not materially differ in their impact across each of the three segments 

  medication delivery the medication delivery business is a manufacturer of intravenous iv solutions and administration sets premixed drugs and drug reconstitution systems prefilled vials and syringes for injectable drugs electronic infusion pumps and other products used to deliver fluids and drugs to patients the business also provides iv nutrition solutions containers and compounding systems and services general anesthetic agents and critical care drugs contract manufacturing services and drug packaging and formulation technologies

  financial information about baxter’s segments and principal product lines is incorporated by reference from the section entitled “notes to consolidated financial statements — note 10 segment information” on pages 8183 of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2005 which is filed as exhibit 13 to this report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

  baxter international is the holding company for various subsidiaries and divisions many of which have their own sales forces and direct their own sales efforts in addition sales are made to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies in the united states cardinal health inc cardinal health warehouses and ships a significant portion of the company’s products through its distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods 

1 include frequent contact by sales representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publications and advertising 

  international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent local distributors in more than 100 countries international subsidiaries employ their own field sales forces in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china colombia the czech republic denmark ecuador finland france germany greece guatemala india italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new zealand norway panama peru the philippines poland portugal russia singapore spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and venezuela in other countries sales are made through independent distributors or sales agents 

contractual arrangements 

  a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states many of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on price increases in the case of hospitals clinical laboratories and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery some hospitals and other customers of medical products have joined group purchasing organizations gpos or combined to form integrated delivery networks idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members the medical products industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex the enhanced purchasing power of these customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

  baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states some of these gpos have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products accordingly in these cases baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter as a result baxter often enters into a separate contract directly with a customer even if the customer is a gpo member baxter’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with its gpos or idns are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier 

raw materials 

  raw materials essential to baxter’s business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers and baxter has at times experienced occasional shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

  in some situations the company has longterm supply contracts with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases 

  some of the raw materials employed in baxter’s production processes are derived from human and animal origins though every care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw materials the nature of their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents baxter believes the production processes that employ these materials adequately eliminate or inactivate infectious or toxic elements that may be present in these raw materials 

2   as is common in new technologies including biotechnology the precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less mature than in other industries this can have a potential impact on the ability to produce product at the quality standards baxter adheres to and within baxter’s cost expectations 

competition 

  although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation there has been consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures 

  global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing governments around the world utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations mcos in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products mcos seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and some other markets for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

  baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments in the bioscience business baxter faces intense competition in the recombinant marketplace primarily from bayer ag and wyeth as manufacturers of recombinant factor viii the medication delivery business expects increased pricing pressure from generic competition for injectable drugs and from gpos in the united states the company believes that additional competitors will continue to enter the market selling a generic form of rocephin an antibiotic and propofol an anesthetic agent resulting in reductions in baxter sales in the renal business global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels 

  baxter’s medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and acute care facilities customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical companies the bioscience business benefits from a number of competitive advantages such as continued innovation of products and services consistency of its supply of products and strong customer relationships baxter’s renal business benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturer of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products 

intellectual property 

  patents and other proprietary rights are essential to baxter’s business baxter also relies on trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products 

3 manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 

  baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks baxter will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers 

  baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that baxter patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products 

  baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation at any given time the company generally is involved as both a plaintiff and defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectualproperty related actions such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products 

research and development 

  baxter’s investment in research and development is essential to its future growth accordingly baxter is actively engaged in research and development programs to develop innovative products systems and manufacturing methods expenditures for baxter’s research and development activities relating to continuing operations were 533 million in 2005 517 million in 2004 and 553 million in 2003 these activities are performed at research and development centers located around the world and include facilities in austria belgium france japan and the united states 

  principal areas of strategic focus for research and development include recombinant therapeutics plasmabased therapeutics biosurgery products small molecule drugs enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery kidney dialysis drug formulation technologies and sterilization technologies the company’s research efforts emphasize selfmanufactured product development and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines for example research relating to the performance and purity of medical plastic materials has resulted in advances that are applicable to a large number of the company’s products baxter supplements its own research and development efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into development agreements with third parties for example in 2005 we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights from kuros biosurgery ag a swiss biotech company to develop and commercialize a portfolio of hard and soft tissuerepair products 

  baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive products the company’s research and development efforts are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its business segments the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including the company’s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate its products from those of its competitors 

quality management

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer 

   the successful and timely implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

7   the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success if we cannot adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’ requirements our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers license or acquire leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 

   as a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous governmental agencies both within and outside the united states the impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are ourselves subject to these laws and regulations and is also indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 

  the manufacture distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities we may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or proposed new products for a number of reasons failure to comply with the requirements of the fda could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of the government to grant approvals restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals 

  we are currently addressing issues with our infusion pumps that are discussed further under the caption entitled “colleague matter” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 4243 of baxter’s annual report to shareholders for fiscal year 2005 although we are working to resolve these pump issues with the fda and in related litigation we nevertheless are subject to administrative and legal actions these actions include product recalls additional product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions including costly litigation there can be no assurance that we will resolve these pump issues without incurring additional charges or facing sanctions in addition our sales of other products may be adversely affected if we experience a loss of customer confidence as a result of these pump issues 

  in addition the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth the healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 

   sales of our products depends in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors these healthcare management organizations and thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services additionally the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been 

8 targeted in this effort we also face challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls accordingly our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time including in ways that are adverse to us any reduction in medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results 

   our future operating results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our quality management program and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to quality management we place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services while baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may result in any of the actions described above on page 5 in addition we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which could result in costly litigation reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

   there has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures as these consolidations occur competition to provide products like ours will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for our products and services to the extent we are forced to reduce our prices our business will become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 

   patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the us and in other countries the patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations 

  we also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions while we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public therefore we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs 

   although no single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial research and development and marketing resources than baxter competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours greater financial research and development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 

   we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 

   our foreign operations are subject to risks which are inherent in conducting business overseas and under foreign laws regulations and customs these risks include possible nationalization expropriation importation limitations violations of us or local laws pricing restrictions and other restrictive governmental actions or economic destabilization instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease also fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial results

international markets 

  

baxter generates approximately 50 percent of its revenues outside the united states while healthcare cost containment continues to be a focus around the world demand for healthcare products and services continues to be strong worldwide particularly in developing markets the company’s strategies emphasize global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical care worldwide 

  

methods of distribution 

  

baxter conducts its selling efforts through its subsidiaries and divisions many of which have their own sales forces and direct their own sales efforts in addition sales are made to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies in the united states cardinal health inc warehouses and ships a significant portion of the company’s products through its distribution centers these centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publications and advertising customers may return defective merchandise for credit or replacement in recent years such returns have been immaterial 

  

international sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent local distributors in more than 100 countries international subsidiaries employ their own field sales forces in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china colombia the czech republic denmark ecuador finland france germany greece guatemala hungary india italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new zealand norway panama peru the philippines poland portugal russia singapore spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and venezuela in other countries sales are made through independent distributors or sales agents 

  

raw materials 

  

raw materials essential to the company’s business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although most of these materials are generally available certain raw materials used in producing some of the company’s products are available only from a limited number of suppliers and baxter has at times experienced occasional shortages of supply in an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy 

  

in some situations the company has longterm supply contracts with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases see “contractual arrangements” 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

baxter relies on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to protect the company’s products and technology baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names some products distributed by the company are sold under the company’s trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to baxter the company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements in the aggregate the company’s intellectual property rights are of material importance to baxter’s business however baxter believes that its overall business position is not materially dependent upon any single patent or trademark 

  

baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company the company also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks over the past few years baxter has increased its enforcement activities by aggressively taking action in various countries to protect its patents and trademarks baxter will continue taking all commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers however there can be no assurance that any action will result in favorable decisions moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with the company’s products in addition thirdparties could independently develop knowhow similar to baxter’s unpatented proprietary information 

  

competition 

  

the changing healthcare environment in recent years has led to increasingly intense competition among biotechnology pharmaceutical and medical device companies although no single company competes with 

  

baxter in all of its businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments generally from global and domestic healthcare companies of all sizes there has been consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its competitors which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures some competitors principally large pharmaceutical companies have greater financial research and development and marketing resources than baxter and large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly competing in the same markets as baxter competition is focused on price costeffectiveness service product performance and technological innovation pressure in these areas is expected to continue 

  

many factors contribute to pricing pressure on baxter and others in the healthcare marketplace governments around the world utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products sales of baxter’s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state in addition to government regulation managed care organizations mcos in the united states which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products mcos seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients baxter faces similar issues outside of the united states in europe and some other markets for example the government provides health care at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products 

  

competition has intensified in each of baxter’s segments in the bioscience business the competitive environment for plasmaderived products has changed dramatically due to the entry of foreign competitors into the us market and increased output by manufacturers resulting in increased supply and pricing pressure competition in the recombinant marketplace has also increased primarily due to the reentry of bayer ag and wyeth as manufacturers of recombinant factor viii and the expansion of their manufacturing capacity the medication delivery business expects increased pricing pressure from generic competition for injectable drugs and from group purchasing organizations gpos in the united states see “contractual arrangements” below for further discussion of baxter’s relationship with premier purchasing partners lp and other gpos in addition the medication delivery business may face increased competition after the spinoff of the hospital products business of abbott laboratories as the new company named hospira focuses its resources on the hospital market in the renal business global and regional competitors are continuing to expand their manufacturing capacity for pd products and their pd sales and marketing channels 

  

the company intends to manage the challenges resulting from this intense competition by focusing on the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

baxter’s medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product 

  

offering as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and acute care facilities customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical companies the bioscience business benefits from a number of competitive advantages such as continued innovation of products and services its strong customer relationships and reliable and consistent supply of its products baxter’s renal business capitalizes on its position as the world’s leading manufacturer of pd products as well as its strong relationships with customers and patients including the many patients who selfadminister the homebased therapy supplied by baxter in addition the company believes that each of its three business segments benefits from the technological advantages of its products as described above see item 1—business—business segments” 

  

baxter’s competitors large and small will continue to introduce competitive products the company’s research and development efforts are essential to remaining competitive in all three business segments the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy safety patients’ ease of use and costeffectiveness are important to baxter’s success the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors including the company’s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate its products from those of competitors 

  

seasonality 

  

sales and earnings have historically been higher in the fourth quarter of the year reflecting principally the buying patterns of customers 

  

quality management 

  

baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to its customers quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving the company’s products and services baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the company’s business units and facilities which relate to the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the company’s products to assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements the company regularly reviews its quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers of raw materials components and finished goods in addition the company conducts quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services 

  

in order to address matters of product quality that arise from time to time baxter has developed and begun the process of implementing a global quality system improvement strategy to review and redesign its quality systems this new program is designed to enhance the effectiveness of corrective and preventive actions taken in response to quality issues that may arise with respect to the company’s products and facilities as a part of this program the company has initiated a number of organizational changes including the hiring of a new corporate vice president for quality as well as other key management positions within the quality regulatory affairs and medical surveillance functions baxter is also expanding its six sigma program to drive product and process improvements as discussed under “government regulation” below as is the case for any medical products company baxter is subject to regulatory scrutiny by the fda and other regulatory agencies baxter has communicated with the fda and various regulatory authorities outside of the us about its global quality system improvement strategy and provides regular updates to the fda about the status of the implementation efforts 

  

from time to time the company may determine that products manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company specifications published standards such as those issued by the international standards organization iso or regulatory requirements when a quality issue is identified depending upon the circumstances baxter may take corrective action such as withdrawal of the product from the market correction of the product at the customer location notice to the customer of revised labeling andor other actions 

  

government regulation 

  

the operations of baxter and many of the products manufactured or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental agencies both within and outside the united states in the united states the federal agencies that regulate the company’s facilities operations employees products their manufacture sale import and export and services include the food and drug administration the drug enforcement agency the environmental protection agency the occupational health  safety administration the department of agriculture the department of labor the department of defense customs and border protection the department of commerce the department of treasury and others because baxter supplies products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by medicare its activities are also subject to regulation by the center for medicaremedicaid services and enforcement by the office of the inspector general within the department of health and human services state agencies also regulate the facilities operations employees products and services of the company within their respective states government agencies outside the united states also regulate public health product registration manufacturing environmental conditions labor exports imports and other aspects of the company’s global operations 

  

the fda in the united states as well as other governmental agencies inside and outside of the united states administer requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling promotion and advertising distribution and postmarket surveillance of baxter’s products the company must obtain specific approval from the fda and nonus regulatory authorities before it can market and sell most of its products even after the company obtains regulatory approval to market a product the product and the company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities the requirements and reviews of these agencies increase the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products bring them to market and maintain regulatory approval 

  

the company is subject to possible administrative and legal actions by the fda and other regulatory agencies such actions may include product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution and other civil and criminal sanctions from time to time the company has instituted voluntary compliance actions such as removing products from the market that were found not to meet applicable requirements and efforts to improve the effectiveness of quality systems 

  

environmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection various nonmaterial capital expenditures for environmental protection were made by baxter during 2003 and similar expenditures are planned for 2004 see item 3—“legal proceedings” 

  

research and development 

  

baxter is actively engaged in research and development programs to develop innovative products systems and manufacturing methods these activities are performed at research and development centers located around the world and include facilities in australia austria belgium canada china colombia france germany italy japan malta sweden the united states and venezuela expenditures for baxtersponsored research and development activities relating to continuing operations were 553 million in 2003 501 million in 2002 and 426 million in 2001 

  

principal areas of strategic focus for research and development include recombinant therapeutics plasmabased therapeutics vaccines small molecule drugs medication delivery systems kidney dialysis drug formulation technologies and sterilization technologies the company’s research efforts emphasize selfmanufactured product development and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines for example research relating to the performance and purity of medical plastic materials has resulted in advances that are applicable to a large number of the company’s products 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 baxter employed approximately 51300 people 

  

contractual arrangements 

  

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the united states many of these contracts have terms of more than one year and limits on price increases in the case of hospitals clinical laboratories and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery hospitals and other customers of medical products manufacturers have combined to form group purchasing organizations or gpos and integrated delivery networks or idns to enhance purchasing power gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members the medical products industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex the enhanced purchasing power of these customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

  

baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major gpos in the united states including premier purchasing partners lp these agreements allow members of the gpo to purchase from the suppliers of their choice and therefore baxter often enters into a separate contract directly with a customer even if the customer is a gpo member some of these gpos including premier have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products this is the case for instance with respect to the company’s agreement with premier for intravenous solutions nutrition products and infusion and pain management pumps and sets accordingly baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a gpo under contract with baxter 

  

sales by various baxter businesses to members of premier pursuant to various contracts represented approximately 83 89 and 101 of the company’s consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the company has a number of contracts with premier that are independently negotiated and expire on various dates baxter’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with premier or other gpos or idns are terminated in part or in their entirety or members decide to purchase from another supplier

businesstobusiness procurement for the healthcare industry utilizing
internetbased technology ghx integrates hospitals and suppliers in an
attempt to improve efficiencies and add value throughout the supply chain in
december 2002 ghx and medibuy inc combined their operations into a single
comprehensive internetbased exchange operating under the global healthcare

its suppliers baxter does not always recover cost increases through customer
pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases

licensed under patents owned by others baxters policy is to protect its
products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis

aggressively taking action in various countries to protect its patents and
trademarks baxter will continue taking all commercially reasonable steps to
enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential
infringers however there can be no assurance that any action will result in
favorable decisions while the protection of its patents and trademarks is
important to baxters business strategy baxter believes that its overall
business position is not materially dependent upon any single patent or
trademark

competition

   the changing healthcare environment in recent years has led to increasingly
intense competition among united states european and japanese healthcare
companies although no single company competes with baxter in all of its
businesses baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments
generally from global and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of
all sizes competition is focused on price costeffectiveness service

   baxters medication delivery bioscience and renal businesses enjoy leading
positions based on a number of competitive advantages the medication delivery
business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering as well
as strong relationships with customers including customer purchasing groups
and pharmaceutical companies the bioscience business benefits from a number of
competitive advantages such as continued innovation of products and services
its strong customer relationships and reliable and consistent supply of its
products baxters renal business capitalizes on its position as the worlds
leading manufacturer of pd products as well as its strong relationships with

of its products for example certain vaccines and recombinant therapeutic
proteins including the influenza vaccine and baxters next generation
recombinant factor viii for the treatment of hemophilia are produced without

bar coding technology and advanced automation that will link intravenous
containers and pumps to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to the
safe delivery of medication in hospitals baxters nanoedge and microsphere
technology platforms permit the formulation and administration of protein
therapeutics as well as insoluble small molecule drugs

development efforts will permit it to remain competitive in all three business
segments baxter believes that its cost position will continue to benefit from

employees

   as of december 31 2002 baxter employed approximately 54600 people

contractual arrangements

   a substantial portion of the companys products are sold through contracts
with customers both within and outside the united states many of these
contracts have terms of more than one year and limits on price increases in
the case of hospitals clinical laboratories and other facilities these
contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories
of products to be purchased by the customer in keeping with the increased
emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery the current trend among
hospitals and other customers of medical products manufacturers is to
consolidate into purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical
products industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to
offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result
transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more
longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these
customers increases the pressure on product pricing

   sales by various baxter businesses to members of a hospital buying group
premier purchasing partners lp pursuant to various contracts with premier
represented approximately 89 101 and 100 of the companys consolidated
net sales from continuing operations in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the
company has a number of contracts with premier that expire on various dates in
2003 and 2004 sales to members of premier could be impacted if any of the
companys contracts with premier are not renewed in part or in their entirety
however baxters contracts with premier are independently negotiated members
of the premier group are free to purchase from the suppliers of their choice
and a loss of any contract would not necessarily mean the loss of all sales
under that contract to all members of the group

differ and possibly differ materially from those expressed in any such
forwardlooking statements these factors include but are not limited to
interest rates technological advances in the medical field economic
conditions demand and market acceptance risks for new and existing products

company may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves any such
charge could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded

   currency fluctuations are also a significant variable for global companies
especially fluctuations in local currencies where hedging opportunities are
unreasonably expensive or unavailable if the united states dollar strengthens
significantly against most foreign currencies the companys ability to realize
projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings outside the united states
could be negatively impacted

   the company believes that its expectations with respect to forwardlooking

item 3  legal proceedings

   baxter international and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants
in a number of lawsuits claims and proceedings including product liability
claims involving products now or formerly manufactured or sold by the company
or by companies that were acquired by the company these cases and claims raise
difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many
uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and
circumstances of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction in which each
suit is brought and differences in applicable law baxter has established
reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
certain of the matters discussed below for these matters there is a
possibility that resolution of the matters could result in an additional loss
in excess of presently established reserves also there is a possibility that
resolution of certain of the companys legal contingencies for which there is
no reserve could result in a loss management is not able to estimate the
amount of such loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss
however management believes that while such a future charge could have a
material adverse impact on the companys net income and net cash flows in the
period in which it is recorded or paid no such charge would have a material
adverse effect on baxters consolidated financial position

mammary implant litigation

   baxter international together with certain of its subsidiaries is
currently a defendant in various courts in a number of lawsuits brought by
individuals all seeking damages for injuries of various types allegedly caused
by

silicone mammary implants previously manufactured by the heyerschulte division
of american hospital supply corporation ahsc ahsc which was acquired by
baxter in 1985 divested its heyerschulte division in 1984 it is not known
how many of these claims and lawsuits involve products manufactured and sold by
heyerschulte as opposed to other manufacturers

   in december 1998 a panel of independent medical experts appointed by a
federal judge announced its findings that reported medical studies contained no
clear evidence of a connection between silicone mammary implants and
traditional or atypical systemic diseases in june 1999 a similar conclusion
was announced by a committee of independent medical experts from the institute
of medicine an arm of the national academy of sciences

   as of december 31 2002 baxter international together with certain of its
subsidiaries was named as a defendant or codefendant in 129 lawsuits and
three claims relating to mammary implants brought by approximately 285
plaintiffs of which 238 are implant plaintiffs and the remainder are
consortium or second generation plaintiffs of those plaintiffs ten currently
are included in the lindsey class action revised settlement described below
which accounts for approximately nine of the pending lawsuits against the
company additionally 153 plaintiffs have opted out of the revised settlement
representing approximately 88 pending lawsuits and the status of the
remaining plaintiffs with pending lawsuits is unknown some of the optout
plaintiffs filed their cases naming multiple defendants and without product
identification thus not all of the optout plaintiffs will have viable claims
against the company as of december 31 2002 88 of the optout plaintiffs had
confirmed heyerschulte mammary implant product identification furthermore
during 2002 baxter obtained dismissals or agreements for dismissals with
respect to 243 plaintiffs

   in addition to the individual suits against the company a class action on
behalf of all women with silicone mammary implants was filed on march 23 1994
and is pending in the united states district court usdc for the northern
district of alabama involving most manufacturers of such implants including
baxter as successor to ahsc lindsey et al v dow corning et al
usdc n dist ala cv 94p11558s the class action was certified for
settlement purposes only by the court on september 1 1994 and the settlement
terms were subsequently revised and approved on december 22 1995 the revised
settlement the monetary provisions of the revised settlement provide
compensation for all present and future plaintiffs and claimants through a
series of specific funds and a diseasecompensation program involving certain
specified medical conditions all appeals directly challenging the revised
settlement have been dismissed baxter bristolmyers squibb company minnesota
mining and manufacturing company union carbide corporation and mcghan medical
corporation are parties to the revised settlement

   in addition to the lindsey class action the company also has been named in
three other purported class actions in various state and provincial courts
only one of which is certified harrington v dow corning corp et al
supreme court british columbia c954330 the class action in british columbia
has been certified solely with respect to the issue of whether silicone gel
breast implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose

   on march 31 2000 the united states department of justice filed an action
in the federal district court in birmingham alabama against baxter and other
manufacturers of breast implants as well as the escrow agent for the revised
settlement fund seeking reimbursement under various federal statutes for
medical care provided to various women with mammary implants on september 26
2001 the district court granted the motion of all defendants including baxter
to dismiss the action the federal government has appealed the dismissal

   baxter believes that a substantial portion of its liability and defense
costs for mammary implant litigation will be covered by insurance subject to
selfinsurance retentions exclusions conditions coverage gaps policy limits
and insurer solvency the company has entered into coverageinplace
agreements with almost all of its insurers each of which issued or subscribed
to policies of insurance between 1974 and 1985 these agreements resolve the
signatory insurers coverage defenses and specify rules and procedures for
allocation and payment of defense and indemnity costs pursuant to which
signatory insurers will reimburse baxter for mammary implant

losses five of the companys claimsmade insurers which issued policies
subsequent to 1985 have agreed to pay under their policies with respect to
mammary implant claims the combined total of the amount thus far paid by
insurers committed for payment and projected by baxter to be paid by insurers
under these agreements is in excess of 900 million based on the companys
current estimate of mammary implant expenditures

new products and technologies for medication delivery through internal
development acquisitions and alliances baxter also leverages its strengths in
anesthesia drug delivery and infusion systems to provide customers with

  renal

   business description  baxter is a leading provider worldwide of products

instruments and dialyzers in addition the company owns and operates dialysis
clinics in partnership with local physicians outside the united states in the

and with nephrologists to operate interventional outpatient centers

   growth strategy  baxter is growing its presence in renal care by addressing
the needs of kidneydisease patients over their lifetime of carefrom initial
diagnosis through dialysis and organ replacement baxters integrated care
strategy looks at that spectrum of care and considers where it makes sense for
baxter to participate for example in 2001 baxter acquired the assets and
exclusive rights to a proprietary recombinant drug for the treatment of anemia
the company also conducted a landmark clinical trial with evidence suggesting
broader applicability for pd therapy which could yield a shift in practice
patterns that could expand use of pd over time other growth will come through
continued product innovation ehealth initiatives additional acquisitions and
alliances and further expansion in developing markets

   product development  innovation remains key to baxters continued
leadership and growth in renal care with several new product launches planned
in 2002 these include baxters first synthetic hd dialyzer called syntra and
new hd instruments for selfcare centers the home and the acutecare setting
also in 2002 the company plans to introduce new and improved approaches to pd
that provide unique patient benefits baxter expects to receive approval from
the us food and drug administration for extraneal pd solution baxter also
will be launching homechoice pediatric an updated automated pd machine
designed for patients who require lower volumes of fluid particularly
children the system offers new safety features and makes the dialysis process
even more convenient for pediatric patients and their parents

united states markets

   the health care marketplace continues to be highly competitive there has
been consolidation in the companys customer base and by its competitors
which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures these industry trends
are expected to continue the company intends to continue to manage these
issues by developing new products and services leveraging its cost structure
making acquisitions and entering alliances

international markets

   baxter generates close to 50 percent of its revenues outside the united
states while health care cost containment continues to be a focus around the
world demand for health care products and services continues to be strong
worldwide particularly in developing markets the companys strategies
emphasize global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical care
worldwide

companies including cerus corporation with which it is jointly developing a
pathogen inactivation system for platelets plasma and red blood cells for
transfusion and acambis a british vaccine developer with which baxter is
producing smallpox vaccine for the us government

methods of distribution

   baxter conducts its selling efforts through its subsidiaries and divisions
many subsidiaries and divisions have their own sales forces and direct their
own sales efforts in addition sales are made to and through independent
distributors and drug wholesalers acting as sales agents in the united states
allegiance healthcare corporation warehouses and ships a significant portion of
the companys products through its distribution centers these distribution
centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt
customer service sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by
sales representatives automated communications via various electronic
purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins
directmail campaigns trade publications and advertising customers may return
defective merchandise for credit or replacement in recent years such returns
have been immaterial

   international sales are made and products are distributed in over 100
countries either on a direct basis or through independent local distributors
international subsidiaries employ their own field sales forces in argentina
australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china colombia the czech
republic denmark ecuador finland france germany greece guatemala
hungary india ireland italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new
zealand norway panama peru the philippines portugal russia singapore
spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and
venezuela in other countries sales are made through independent distributors
or sales agents

raw materials

   raw materials essential to the companys business are purchased worldwide in
the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although the vast
majority of these materials are generally available the company has
experienced occasional shortages in supply of source plasma and of bulk
recombinant factor viii used by baxter in its bioscience business in addition
certain raw materials used in producing some of the companys products are
available only from a small number of suppliers baxter works closely with its
suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and
reliability the company also continues to develop new sources of supply and
does not believe that periodic shortages in supply of raw materials will have a
material adverse effect on the companys business

   in some of these situations the company has longterm supply contracts with
its suppliers although it does not consider its obligations under such
contracts to be material baxter does not always recover cost increases through
customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price
increases see contractual arrangements

patents and trademarks

   products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks
and trade names some products purchased and resold by the company are sold
under the companys trade names while others are sold under trade names owned
by its suppliers

                                      4

page

   baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and is
licensed under patents owned by others baxters policy is to protect its
products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis
this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection
against obtaining the greatest value for the company the company also
recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks
over the past few years baxter has increased its enforcement activities by
aggressively taking action in various countries to protect its patents and
trademarks baxter will continue taking all commercially reasonable steps to
enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential
infringers however there can be no assurance that any action will result in
favorable decisions while the protection of its patents and trademarks is
important to baxters business strategy baxter believes that its overall
business position is not materially dependent upon any single patent or
trademark

competition

   historically competition in the health care industry has been characterized
by the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention
diagnosis and treatment of disease the company believes that it has benefited
from the technological advantages of certain of its products while competitors
will continue to introduce new products that compete with those sold by baxter
the company believes that its research and development efforts will permit it
to remain competitive in all presently material product areas although no
single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter is faced
with substantial competition in all of its markets

   the changing health care environment in recent years has led to increasingly
intense competition among united states and certain european health care
suppliers competition is focused on price service and product performance
pressure in these areas is expected to continue

   the company continues to increase its efforts to minimize costs and meet
price competition the company believes that its cost position will continue to
benefit from improvements in manufacturing technology and increased economies
of scale the company intends to continue to develop new products and services
invest in human resources and capital to upgrade and expand facilities
leverage its cost structure and make selected acquisitions

credit and working capital practices

   as of march 1 2002 baxters debt ratings on senior debt were a3 by
moodys a by standard  poors and a by fitch the companys credit practices
and related working capital needs are comparable to those of other market
participants collection periods tend to be longer for sales outside the united
states

quality management

   baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products and
services to its customers a major portion of the companys quality systems
relate to the design and development manufacturing packaging sterilization
handling distribution and labeling of the products by the company these
quality systems including control procedures that are developed and
implemented by technically trained professionals result in rigid
specifications for product design raw materials components packaging
materials labels sterilization procedures and overall manufacturing process
control the quality systems integrate the efforts of suppliers of raw
materials components and finished goods to ensure we meet customer and
regulatory requirements these systems are designed to ensure that all
appropriate standards and requirements are met before goods are released in
addition to other quality processes baxter initiated a six sigma quality
process several years ago to train all appropriate individuals in statistical
process control and related subjects to ensure continuous improvement

innovative products systems and manufacturing methods these activities are
performed at research and development centers located around the world and

japan malta sweden the united states and venezuela expenditures for
baxtersponsored research and development activities were 427 million in 2001

   principal areas of strategic focus for research and development include
recombinant therapeutics plasmabased therapeutics vaccines small molecule
drugs pathogen inactivation drug formulation technologies medication
delivery systems and kidney dialysis the companys research efforts emphasize
selfmanufactured product development and portions of that research relate to
multiple product lines for example many product categories benefit from the
companys research effort as applied to the human bodys immune and circulatory
systems in addition research relating to the performance and purity of
plastic materials has resulted in advances that are applicable to a large
number of the companys products

government regulation

   most products manufactured or sold by the company are subject to regulation
by numerous governmental agencies both within and outside the united states
in the united states the federal agencies that regulate the companys
facilities operations personnel and products their manufacture sale import
and export include the food and drug administration fda the environmental
protection agency the occupational health  safety administration the customs
service the department of commerce the treasury department and others state
agencies also regulate the facilities operations products and personnel of
the company within their respective states government agencies outside the
united states also regulate public health product manufacturing environmental
conditions employment export customs and other aspects of the companys
global operations

   with regard to the companys facilities and products various governmental
agencies including the fda in the united states regulate manufacturing
labeling promotion and advertising in addition the agencies have the
authority to halt the distribution of medical products detain or seize
adulterated or misbranded medical products or order the company to take other
steps to correct issues surrounding the products the agencies may also require
notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical products
that present risks of substantial harm to the public health from time to time
the company has removed products from the market that were found not to meet
acceptable standards

   environmental policies of the company mandate compliance with all applicable
regulatory requirements concerning environmental quality and contemplate among
other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection
various nonmaterial capital expenditures for environmental protection were
made by baxter during 2001 and similar expenditures are planned for 2002 see
item 3legal proceedings

employees

   as of december 31 2001 baxter employed approximately 48000 people

contractual arrangements

   a substantial portion of the companys products are sold through contracts
with customers both within and outside the united states some of these
contracts have terms of more than one year and limits on price increases in
the case of hospitals clinical laboratories and other facilities these
contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories
of products to be purchased by the customer in keeping with the increased
emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among
hospitals and other customers of medical products manufacturers is to
consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the
medical products industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in
order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result
transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more
longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these
larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing although
management is unable to estimate the potential impact at this time

forwardlooking statements these statements are based on the companys current
expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties some of these risks
and uncertainties are factors that affect all international businesses while
some are specific to the company and the health care arenas in which it
operates

   many factors could affect the companys actual results causing results to
differ and possibly differ materially from those expressed in any such
forwardlooking statements these factors include but are not limited to
interest rates technological advances in the medical field economic
conditions demand and market acceptance risks for new and existing products

could be negatively impacted

mammary implant litigation

   baxter international together with certain of its subsidiaries is
currently a defendant in various courts in a number of lawsuits brought by
individuals all seeking damages for injuries of various types allegedly caused
by silicone mammary implants previously manufactured by the heyerschulte
division heyerschulte of american hospital supply corporation ahsc ahsc
which was acquired by baxter in 1985 divested its heyerschulte division in
1984

   in december 1998 a panel of independent medical experts appointed by a
federal judge announced its findings that reported medical studies contained no
clear evidence of a connection between silicone mammary implants and
traditional or atypical systemic diseases in june 1999 a similar conclusion
was announced by a committee of independent medical experts from the institute
of medicine a part of the national academy of sciences

   as of december 31 2001 baxter international together with certain of its
subsidiaries was named as a defendant or codefendant in 303 lawsuits and two
claims relating to mammary implants brought by approximately 618 plaintiffs
of which 503 are implant plaintiffs and the remainder are consortium or second
generation plaintiffs of those plaintiffs 15 currently are included in the
lindsey class action revised settlement described below which accounts for 14
of the pending lawsuits against the company additionally 392 plaintiffs have
opted out of the revised settlement representing 243 pending lawsuits and
the status of the remaining plaintiffs with pending lawsuits is unknown some
of the optout plaintiffs filed their cases naming multiple defendants and
without product identification thus not all of the optout plaintiffs will
have viable claims against the company as of december 31 2001 232 of the
optout plaintiffs had confirmed heyerschulte mammary implant product
identification furthermore during 2001 baxter obtained dismissals or
agreements for dismissals with respect to 802 plaintiffs

   in addition to the individual suits against the company a class action on
behalf of all women with silicone mammary implants was filed on march 23 1994
and is pending in the united states district court usdc for

the northern district of alabama involving most manufacturers of such implants
including baxter as successor to ahsc lindsey et al v dow corning et
al usdc n dist ala cv 94p11558s the class action was certified
for settlement purposes only by the court on september 1 1994 and the
settlement terms were subsequently revised and approved on december 22 1995
revised settlement the monetary provisions of the revised settlement provide
compensation for all present and future plaintiffs and claimants through a
series of specific funds and a diseasecompensation program involving certain
specified medical conditions all appeals directly challenging the revised
settlement have been dismissed

mining and manufacturing company each paid 125 million into the
courtestablished fund as an initial fund to pay claims under the revised
settlement union carbide corporation and mcghan medical corporation also are
parties to the revised settlement

   in addition to the lindsey class action the company also has been named in
three other purported class actions in various state and provincial courts
only one of which is certified harrington v dow corning corp et al
supreme court british columbia c954330 the class action in british columbia
has been certified solely with respect to the issue of whether silicone gel
breast implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose

   on march 31 2000 the united states department of justice filed an action
in the federal district court in birmingham alabama against baxter and other
manufacturers of breast implants as well as the escrow agent for the revised
settlement fund seeking reimbursement under various federal statutes for
medical care provided to various women with mammary implants on september 26
2001 the district court granted the motion of all defendants including baxter
to dismiss the action the federal government has appealed the dismissal

   baxter believes that a substantial portion of its liability and defense
costs for mammary implant litigation will be covered by insurance subject to
selfinsurance retentions exclusions conditions coverage gaps policy limits
and insurer solvency the company has entered into coverageinplace
agreements with almost all of its insurers each of which issued or subscribed
to policies of insurance between 1974 and 1985 these agreements resolve the
signatory insurers coverage defenses and specify rules and procedures for
allocation and payment of defense and indemnity costs pursuant to which
signatory insurers will reimburse baxter for mammary implant losses five of
the companys claimsmade insurers which issued policies subsequent to 1985
have agreed to pay under their policies with respect to mammary implant claims
the combined total of the amount thus far paid by insurers committed for
payment and projected by baxter to be paid by insurers under these agreements
is in excess of 800 million based on the companys current estimate of
mammary implant expenditures

   baxter conducts its selling efforts through its subsidiaries and divisions
many subsidiaries and divisions have their own sales forces and direct their
own sales efforts in addition sales are made to and through independent
distributors dealers and sales agents in the united states allegiance

products through its distribution centers these distribution centers are
generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer

raw materials

   raw materials essential to the companys business are purchased worldwide
in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers although the vast
majority of these materials are generally available the company has
experienced occasional shortages in supply of source plasma and of bulk
recombinant factor viii used by baxter in its bioscience business in
addition certain raw materials used in producing some of the companys
products are available only from a small number of suppliers baxter works
closely with its suppliers

to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability
the company also continues to develop new sources of supply and does not
believe that periodic shortages in supply of raw materials will have a material
adverse effect on the companys business

   in some of these situations the company has longterm supply contracts with
its suppliers although it does not consider its obligations under such
contracts to be material baxter does not always recover cost increases through
customer pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such price
increases see contractual arrangements

patents and trademarks

   products manufactured by baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks
and trade names some products purchased and resold by the company are sold
under the companys trade names while others are sold under trade names owned
by its suppliers

   baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and is
licensed under patents owned by others baxters policy is to protect its
products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis
this protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection
against obtaining the greatest value for the company the company also
recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks
over the past few years baxter has increased its enforcement activities by
aggressively taking action in various countries to protect its patents and
trademarks including action taken in chile germany japan sweden the
netherlands and the united states an example of baxters increased enforcement
activity includes several suits brought in japan against two competitors
selling fibrin sealant product which baxter contends infringes one of its
japanese patents while baxter will take all reasonable and necessary action to
enforce its trademarks and patents against potential infringers there can be
no assurance that any such action will result in favorable decisions however
baxter believes that its overall business position is not materially dependent
upon any single patent or trademark

competition

   historically competition in the health care industry has been characterized
by the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention
diagnosis and treatment of disease the company believes that it has benefited
from the technological advantages of certain of its products while competitors
will continue to introduce new products that compete with those sold by baxter
the company believes that its research and development efforts will permit it
to remain competitive in all presently material product areas although no
single company competes with baxter in all of its businesses baxter is faced
with substantial competition in all of its markets

   the changing health care environment in recent years has led to increasingly
intense competition among united states and certain european health care
suppliers competition is focused on price service and product performance
pressure in these areas is expected to continue

   the company continues to increase its efforts to minimize costs and meet
price competition the company believes that its cost position will continue to
benefit from improvements in manufacturing technology and increased economies
of scale the company intends to continue to develop new products and services
invest in capital and human resources to upgrade and expand facilities
leverage its cost structure and make selected acquisitions

credit and working capital practices

   as of march 1 2001 baxters debt ratings on senior debt were a3 by
moodys a by standard  poors and a by duff  phelps the companys credit
practices and related working capital needs are comparable to those of other
market participants collection periods tend to be longer for sales outside the
united states

services to its customers a major portion of the companys quality systems
relate to the design and development manufacturing packaging

and improve products systems and manufacturing methods these activities are
performed at research and development centers located around the world and
include facilities in australia austria belgium france italy japan
malta singapore sweden and the united states expenditures for baxter

xenotransplantation pathogen inactivation and medicationdelivery systems
the companys research efforts emphasize selfmanufactured product
development and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines
for example many product categories benefit from the companys research
effort as applied to the human bodys circulatory systems in addition
research relating to the performance and purity of plastic materials has
resulted in advances that are applicable to a large number of the companys
products

environmental protection were made by baxter during 2000 and similar
expenditures are planned for 2001 see item 3legal proceedings

of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the
customer in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in
health care delivery the current trend among hospitals and other customers of
medical products manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups
to enhance purchasing power the medical products industry has also experienced
some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to
large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more
complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the
enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase the
pressure on product pricing although management is unable to estimate the
potential impact at this time

but not limited to statements in the company overview international
markets and recent acquisitions sections of this report including material
incorporated therein by reference are forwardlooking statements these
statements are based on the companys current expectations and involve numerous
risks and uncertainties some of these risks and uncertainties are factors that
affect all international businesses while some are specific to the company and
the health care arenas in which it operates

   the factors below in some cases have affected and could affect the companys

 mammary implant litigation

   baxter international together with certain of its subsidiaries is
currently a defendant in various courts in a number of lawsuits brought by
individuals all seeking damages for injuries of various types allegedly
caused by silicone mammary implants previously manufactured by the heyer
schulte division heyerschulte of american hospital supply corporation
ahsc ahsc which was acquired by baxter in 1985 divested its heyerschulte
division in 1984 it is not known how many of these claims and lawsuits
involve products manufactured and sold by heyerschulte as opposed to other
manufacturers

   in december 1998 a panel of independent medical experts appointed by a
federal judge announced its findings that reported medical studies contained
no clear evidence of a connection between silicone mammary implants and
traditional or atypical systemic diseases in june 1999 a similar conclusion
was announced by a committee of independent medical experts from the institute
of medicine a part of the national academy of sciences

   as of december 31 2000 baxter international together with certain of its
subsidiaries had been named as a defendant or codefendant in 651 lawsuits

against the company as of december 31 2000 395 of the optout plaintiffs had
confirmed heyerschulte mammary implant product identification furthermore
during 2000 baxter obtained dismissals or agreements for dismissals with
respect to 2753 plaintiffs

   in addition to the individual suits against the company a class action on
behalf of all women with silicone mammary implants was filed on march 23 1994
and is pending in the united states district court usdc for the northern
district of alabama involving most manufacturers of such implants including
baxter as successor to ahsc lindsey et al v dow corning et al
usdc n dist ala cv 94p11558s the class action was certified for
settlement purposes only by the court on september 1 1994 and the settlement
terms were subsequently revised and approved on december 22 1995 revised
settlement the monetary provisions of the revised settlement provide
compensation for all present and future plaintiffs and claimants through a
series of specific funds and a diseasecompensation program involving certain
specified medical conditions all appeals directly challenging the revised
settlement have been dismissed

   on january 16 1996 baxter bristolmyers squibb company and minnesota
mining and manufacturing company each paid 125 million into the court
established fund as an initial fund to pay claims under the revised settlement
union carbide corporation and mcghan medical corporation also are parties to
the revised settlement

   in addition to the lindsey class action the company also has been named in
five other purported class actions in various state and provincial courts only
one of which is certified harrington v dow corning corp et al supreme
court british columbia c954330 the class action in british columbia has been
certified solely with respect to the issue of whether silicone gel breast
implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose

   the mammary implant litigation includes issues related to which of baxters
insurers are responsible for covering each matter and the extent of the
companys claims for contribution against third parties baxter believes that a
substantial portion of its liability and defense costs for mammary implant
litigation will be covered by insurance subject to selfinsurance retentions
exclusions conditions coverage gaps policy limits and insurer solvency the
company has entered into coverageinplace agreements with almost all of its
insurers each of which issued or subscribed to policies of insurance between
1974 and 1985 these agreements resolve the signatory insurers coverage
defenses and specify rules and procedures for allocation and payment of defense
and indemnity costs pursuant to which signatory insurers will reimburse baxter
for mammary implant losses five of the companys claimsmade insurers which
issued policies subsequent to 1985 have agreed to pay under their policies
with respect to mammary implant claims the combined total of the amount thus
far paid by insurers committed for payment and projected by baxter to be paid
by insurers under these agreements is in excess of 800 million based on the
companys current estimate of mammary implant expenditures
