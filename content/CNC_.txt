industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid medicare and commercial products we currently have operations domestically and internationally 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided by the federal government each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 

under the affordable care act aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level subject to the states elections the federal government paid 90 of the costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries in 2021 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in subsequent years the federal share is scheduled to remain at 90 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act the aged blind or disabled abd program covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a 

growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created the state childrens health insurance program chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

longterm services and supports ltss is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltss services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state medicaid ltss benefits the largest groups receiving ltss by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance and other populations states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltss beneficiaries according to advancing states formerly national association of states united for aging and disabilities as of august 2021 25 states utilize some form of managed ltss 

the majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for medicaid most commonly through title ive of the social security act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes the federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state medicaid in addition the aca requires states to make former foster care children eligible for medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in medicaid at that time 

as of the first quarter of 2020 cms estimated the total medicaid market to be approximately 684 billion in 2021 and estimates the market will grow to over 10 trillion by 2028 medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 55 in 2021 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 58 between 2021 and 2028 due to the timing of the cms report and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic the aforementioned projections do not take into account the impact of covid19 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 113 million dualeligible enrollees in 2020 these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltss medicaremedicaid plans mmp medicare advantage dual special needs plan dsnp and standard medicare advantage lines of business 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments which is typically more expensive as a result many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe managed care has improved the quality of care for medicaid beneficiaries and lowered costs the majority of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid populations 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups the medicare program provides healthcare coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older as well as to individuals with certain disabilities 

we provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits as our medicare advantage members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star ratings calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans were required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 

cms estimated the total medicare market was approximately 923 billion in 2021 and estimates the market will grow to approximately 16 trillion by 2028 medicare spending is estimated to have increased 75 in fiscal 2021 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 77 between 2021 and 2028 

medicare prescription drug plan 

we have contracted with cms to serve as a plan sponsor offering standalone medicare part d pdp plans to medicareeligible beneficiaries we offer pdps in 50 states and the district of columbia our pdps offer national innetwork prescription drug coverage including a preferred pharmacy network subject to limitations in certain circumstances 

our pdp contracts with cms are renewable for successive oneyear terms unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the current contract year or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

the medicare part d prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs the government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage adjusted for risk factor payments additional subsidies are provided for duallyeligible beneficiaries and specified lowincome beneficiaries 

commercial 

established in 2010 and operational in 2014 the aca created health insurance marketplaces which are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes generally between 100400 of the federal poverty level with some exceptions to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

w e also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups we offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers coverage typically is subject to copays and can be subject to deductibles and coinsurance as our commercial members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year

providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery cost management and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 

• under our feeforservice contracts with providers we pay a negotiated fee for covered services this model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider 

• under our capitated contracts providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements a provider groups financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group depending on state law and the regulatory environment it may be necessary for us to pay such claims 

• under valuebased arrangements providers can be paid under either a capitated or feeforservice model the arrangement however contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon their performance in cost and quality measures 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract services are primarily provided on a feeforservice basis 

we often start our provider relationships in a payforperformance arrangement before we transition to a risksharing arrangement which is based on the total cost of care as we advance along this continuum it strengthens our partnerships with our providers enabling the delivery of highquality care 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and population health management programs our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn has helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

• provider engagement performance tools and processes lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes healthcare costs and member satisfaction high quality provider support and service levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performancebased measures to select and pay health plans we have a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panels we meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend 

strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcomes our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their valuebased contract 

• our integrated care model is membercentric and managed by one care manager assigned to a member who looks at the total care for the member in a holistic manner this single care manager will coordinate all care for that member including behavioral health medical health and homebased primary care in accordance with an individualized integrated care plan this care manager also coordinates meetings with the members integrated care team to assess and alter the care plan as needed this results in better clinical outcomes and improved member satisfaction 

• the provider portal provides claims and eligibility research prior authorizations member panels care gaps patient analytics and provider analytics meant to drive provider engagement and improved patient outcomes data and reporting are delivered via a secure userfriendly webbased provider portal this is provided through our suite of technology platforms

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as care management software dental benefits management homebased primary care services life and population health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management 

our population health programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ multiple strategies including care coordination and complex case management which are tailored to meet the individual needs of our members as well as address the unique health needs within the communities where we serve we promote local physician participation in quality improvement through physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this structure ensures clinical oversight and is critical to the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these programs include 

• use of nationally recognized interqual or milliman criteria to help ensure our members receive the right level of care in the most appropriate setting 

• preauthorized highrisk medication and services that are commonly over or inappropriately prescribed 

• member education and the provision of appropriate and easily accessed urgent care services to help members avoid unnecessary and costly emergency department visits and improve their healthcare experience 

• emphasis on care management and care coordination where clinicians such as nurses and social workers who are employed to assist highrisk and other selected members with the coordination of healthcare services that meet their specific needs 

• disease management for chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes through a comprehensive multidisciplinary and collaborative approach 

• prenatal case management for those with highrisk pregnancies to help them deliver fullterm healthy infants and 

• pharmacy treatment compliance programs driven by evidencebased clinical policies and focused on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose delivered in an efficient format and utilized for the correct duration 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by health plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members in 2021 we achieved accreditation in 31 of 33 eligible states for at least one product medicare medicaid or commercial including health insurance marketplace 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality 

• for the 2021 star rating calculated in 2020 for the quality bonus payment in 2022 two contracts received 45 out of 50 stars three contracts received 40 stars 17 contracts received 35 stars and 13 contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2021 star rating we carry a 35 star parent organization rating approximately 30 of our medicare members are in a 40 star or above plan for the 2022 bonus year 

• for the 2022 star rating calculated in 2021 for the quality bonus payment in 2023 one contract received 50 out of 50 stars three contracts received 45 stars 11 contracts received 40 stars 23 contracts received 35 stars and eight contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2022 star rating we carry a 40 star parent organization rating over 50 of our medicare members are in a 40 star or above plan for the 2023 bonus year the yearoveryear increase in our star quality ratings is primarily due to certain disaster relief provisions which we do not expect to be applicable in future years as a result we expect to experience a meaningful decrease to our star ratings for the 2023 star rating year which impacts the 2024 bonus year we expect this to be followed by a subsequent increase to our star ratings for the 2024 star rating year which impacts the 2025 bonus year 

the parent organization star rating is used for new medicare contracts while existing contracts follow their individual star ratings to determine bonus payments we remain committed to our quality initiatives and continue to invest in the programs which we expect to translate into value over the next few years

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes including business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level this includes but is not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

• national and regional commercial managed care organizations that focus on providing healthcare services to medicaid medicare and correctional members in addition to members in marketplace and private commercial plans these organizations consist of national and regional organizations as well as notforprofits and organizations that operate in a small geographic location and are owned by providers primarily hospitals some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management behavioral health management population health management correctional healthcare management and nurse triage call support centers 

• primary care case management programs that are established by the states through contracts with primary care providers under these programs physicians provide primary care services to medicaid recipients as well as limited population health management oversight 

• accountable care organizations that consist of groups of doctors hospitals and other healthcare providers who come together to provide coordinated high quality care to their patients 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state county federal and commercial contracts in addition the impact of the aca and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates population health management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve   

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product we believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at the local state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction states have implemented national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting states have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations hmos and insurance companies we are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators 

regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration remains uncertain 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments 

departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan prescription drug plan pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions for example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

• premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us 

• stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time 

• disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures and 

• programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

additionally the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid and medicare programs our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

the aca transformed the us healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written in years when imposed the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business in december 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the acas individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid ie that it was not severable from the aca that decision was appealed to the fifth circuit which ruled in december 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability the us supreme court heard oral arguments in november 2020 and issued its decision in june 2021 ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the individual mandate provision thus leaving the aca in effect for a further discussion of the aca see risk factors  significant changes or judicial challenges to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment to ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state 

we provide medicare advantage pdps dsnps and mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 

• eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes 

• covered services 

• eligible providers 

• subcontractors 

• recordkeeping and record retention 

• periodic financial and informational reporting 

• quality assurance 

• accreditation 

• health education and wellness and prevention programs 

• timeliness of claims payment 

• financial standards 

• safeguarding of member information 

• fraud waste and abuse detection and reporting 

• grievance procedures and 

• organization and administrative systems 

a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years the contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 27 states under federallyfacilitated marketplace contracts with cms and statebased exchanges both contract types are renewable on an annual basis 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act the general data protection regulation gdpr in the european union eu and state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement 

authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified in october 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we must maintain compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at medicare medicaid health insurance marketplace and commercial products the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act additional fraud waste and abuse prohibitions include a wide range of operating activities such as kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans pdps and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud waste and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment

risks relating to our business 

our business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health pandemics such as covid19  

public health pandemics or widespread outbreaks of contagious diseases such as covid19 could materially adversely impact our business our business has been affected by the spread of covid19 and the extent to which covid19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence factors that may determine the severity of the impact include the duration and scale of the outbreak new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 including new strains which may be more contagious more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines the costs of prevention and treatment of covid19 and the potential that we will not receive government reimbursement of additional expenses incurred by our members who contract or require testing for covid19 or who experience other health impacts as a result of the pandemic employee retention mobility productivity and utilization of leave and other benefits financial and other impacts on the healthcare provider community disruptions or delays in the supply chain for testing and treatment supplies protective equipment and other products and services and the actions to contain covid19 or address its impact including laws regulations and emergency orders such as stay at home orders physical distancing requirements forced business closures and vaccine requirements or mandates and directives related to the timing and scope of vaccine distribution among other factors in addition increased utilization patterns including deferred demand have had and may continue to have an impact on our business as members pattern of seeking healthcare fluctuates for example risk adjustment could be adversely impacted by covid19 related impacts such as disrupted member utilization patterns access to members for inhome assessments and regulatory changes such as the retroactive disallowance of hydroxychloroquine adversely impacting our second quarter 2021 results additionally the spread of covid19 has previously caused disruption and volatility in the global capital markets and future disruptions could adversely impact our access to capital similarly a decline in interest rates has reduced and could further reduce our investment income finally the impact of the above items on our government partners could result in program changes or delays or reduced capitation payments to us we cannot at this time predict the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic but it could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of unique risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions penalties or other actions if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are modified or terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance for example in october 2021 the cms published updated medicare star quality ratings for the 2022 rating year over 50 of our medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2023 bonus year compared to approximately 30 for the 2022 bonus year and 46 for the 2021 bonus year the increase in star quality ratings for the 2022 rating year is primarily due to certain disaster relief provisions which we do not expect to be applicable in future years as a result we expect to experience a meaningful decrease to our star ratings for the 2023 star rating year which impacts the 2024 bonus year our quality bonus and rebates may be negatively impacted and the attractiveness of our medicare advantage plans may be reduced if we are unable to maintain or improve these ratings 

there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

although we do not anticipate that a singlepayer health insurance system or other major healthcare reform provisions will be enacted by the current congress or state regulators certain members of congress and certain state regulators have proposed legislative initiatives that would establish some form of a single public or quasipublic agency that organizes healthcare financing but under which healthcare delivery would remain private additionally the potential impact of the current administration on healthcare reform efforts is unknown we are unable to predict the nature and success of these or other initiatives or political changes which could have an adverse effect on our business 

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our governmentsponsored health programs revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expenses exceed our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services outofnetwork utilization and pricing hospital and pharmaceutical costs unexpected events such as disasters the effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent diseases such as covid19 new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits also member behavior could continue to be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the aca including legal challenges to the aca or potential changes in premium subsidies 

our medical expenses include claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region or launch a new product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

riskadjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to estimate and could result in retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

most of our government customers employ riskadjustment models to determine the premium amount they pay for each member this model pays more for members with predictably higher costs according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled premium payments are generally established at fixed intervals according to the contract terms and then adjusted on a retroactive basis we reassess the estimates of the risk adjustment settlements each reporting period and any resulting 

adjustments are made to premium revenue in addition revisions by our government customers to the riskadjustment models have reduced and may continue to reduce our premium revenue 

as a result of the variability of certain factors that determine estimates for riskadjusted premiums including plan risk scores the actual amount of retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates consequently our estimate of our plans’ risk scores for any period and any resulting change in our accrual of premium revenues related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the data provided to our government customers to determine the risk score are subject to audit by them even after the annual settlements occur these audits may result in the refund of premiums to the government customer previously received by us which could be significant and would reduce our premium revenue in the year that repayment is required for example risk adjustment could be adversely impacted by covid19 related impacts such as disrupted member utilization patterns access to members for inhome assessments and regulatory changes such as the retroactive disallowance of hydroxychloroquine adversely impacting our second quarter 2021 results 

government customers have performed and continue to perform audits of selected plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each member in 2018 cms proposed the removal of the fee for service adjuster from the risk adjustment data validation audit methodology if adopted this proposal or any similar cms rule making initiative could increase our audit error scores we anticipate that cms will continue to conduct audits of our medicare contracts and contract years on an ongoing basis an audit may result in the refund of premiums to cms it is likely that a payment adjustment could occur as a result of these audits and any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

any failure to adequately price products offered or any reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether in addition the risk adjustment provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the health insurance marketplace product are subject to a high degree of estimation and variability and are affected by our members acuity relative to the membership acuity of other insurers further changes in the competitive marketplace over time changes to member eligibility in the program design or changes in the financial incentives of individuals to participate in such products may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured or require us to increase premium rates any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection outofnetwork costs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we derive a portion of our cash flow and gross margin from our prescription drug plan pdp operations for which we submit annual bids for participation the results of our bids could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a significant portion of our pdp membership is obtained from the autoassignment of beneficiaries in cmsdesignated regions where our pdp premium bids are below benchmarks of other plans’ bids in general our premium bids are based on assumptions regarding pdp membership utilization drug costs drug rebates and other factors for each region our 2022 pdp bids resulted in 34 of the 34 cms regions in which we were below the benchmarks compared with our 2021 pdp bids in which we were below the benchmarks in 33 regions and within the de minimis range in the remaining region 

if our future part d premium bids are not below the cms benchmarks we risk losing pdp members who were previously assigned to us and we may not have additional pdp members autoassigned to us which could materially reduce our revenue and profits 

our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs 

our contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine 

compliance with performance standards and to set premium rates we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and continue to be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance in some instances our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit there also may be periods of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements in either case it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data 

we may experience challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could adversely affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us and subject us to financial penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with government entities expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment compliance with contract terms and law and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality star ratings harm to our reputation or required changes to the way we do business for example march 2021 the state of ohio filed a civil action against us the complaint alleged breaches of contract with the ohio department of medicaid relating to the provision of pharmacy benefits management pbm services and violations of ohio law relating to such contracts including among other things by i seeking payment for services already reimbursed ii not accurately disclosing to the ohio department of medicaid the true cost of the pbm services and iii inflating dispensing fees for prescription drugs we have reached nofault agreements with the attorneys general of nine states including ohio to resolve claims made by the states related to services provided by envolve our pharmacy benefits manager subsidiary as a result of the settlement the ohio attorney generals litigation against us was dismissed additionally we are in discussions to bring final resolution to these concerns in other affected states consistent with those discussions we recorded a reserve estimate of 1250 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to the issue inclusive of the above settlements and rebates that we determined in the course of the matter are payable across our products notwithstanding such settlement and other ongoing discussions additional claims reviews or investigations relating to our pbm business may still be brought by other states the federal government or shareholder litigants and there is no guarantee we will have the ability to settle such claims with other states within the reserve estimate we have recorded and on other acceptable terms or at all in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent thirdparty vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plans enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements either new programs to determine eligibility or new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or when it chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

execution of our value creation strategy may create disruptions in our business 

our value creation strategy has included and may continue to include the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets while we may continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand into new geographies and complementary business lines as well as to augment existing operations our acquisition strategies may shift as we implement our value creation plan although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems including due to conditions on regulatory approval of such acquisitions and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates including those related to the impacts of covid19 as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability the timing of operating our new east coast headquarters in charlotte and the expected benefits of its completion may also be negatively impacted as a result of these factors 

although our value creation plan is designed to enable us to build upon our strong foundation and unlock value and drive margin expansion through various initiatives including without limitation targeted sga initiatives share repurchases divestitures refinancing activities using datadriven and innovative approaches to enhance efficiency lower costs and drive better health outcomes for our members and providers streamlining procurement and improving our bid process and further scaling through standardization of our operating model and consolidation of our platform these initiatives are subject to a variety of risks including without limitation anticipated benefits not being realized or not at the levels or on the timing anticipated that implementation will be materially delayed or more difficult than expected the diversion of management’s time and attention and initiatives being more expensive to complete than anticipated including as a result of unexpected factors or events 

if we are unable to effectively implement or integrate our value creation strategy including as a result of the continued impact of covid19 our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we have sought and continue to seek to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and diversify our business in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by third parties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations in addition to state corporate law limitations these subsidiaries are subject to more stringent state insurance and hmo laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny or delay our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a significant portion of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for a significant portion of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors in addition the administration of the aca has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of and access to services be able to provide effective telehealth services maintain financial solvency including due to the impact of covid19 or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in 

addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example our wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company hnl is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnls payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our managements attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists which may include cyberattacks by terrorists or other governmental or nongovernmental actors in addition we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of prevention and 

detection controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we may be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management in july 2021 mr neidorff informally communicated to the board that he may decide for personal reasons to step down before the end of his contract after which the board and mr neidorff established a succession planning initiative to ensure a full continuity plan this succession planning process was discussed in the company’s preliminary prospectus supplement filed july 29 2021 subsequently in december 2021 mr neidorff communicated his intent to retire as chief executive officer in 2022 mr neidorff will serve as executive chairman throughout the remainder of 2022 upon his retirement as chief executive officer while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team including our chief executive officer in 2022 these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management team or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

risks relating to regulatory and legal matters 

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging approximately 60 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with federal and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state governments to terminate or modify contracts with them in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity and other regulatory legislative or judicial actions that may have an impact on the operations of government subsidized healthcare programs including ongoing litigation involving the aca for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 sequestration subject to a 2 cap which was extended by the bipartisan budget act of 2019 through 2029 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act of 2020 temporarily suspended the medicare sequestration for the period of may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 while also extending the mandatory sequestration policy by an additional one year through 2030 the bipartisanbicameral omnibus covid relief deal passed in december 2020 further extended the suspension of the medicare sequestration until march 31 2021 and the protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act passed in december 2021 extended the sequester through march 31 2022 and will adjust the sequester to 1 between april 1 2022 and june 30 2022 

in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in 

reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of one or more contracts for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if another federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could change the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs and increase our administrative and healthcare costs under these programs for example we expect medicaid eligibility redeterminations which have been suspended during covid to begin in 2022 which we expect to reduce our membership maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

significant changes or judicial challenges to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the enactment of the aca in march 2010 transformed the us healthcare delivery system through a series of complex initiatives however the aca has faced and continues to face administrative judicial and legislative challenges to repeal or change certain of its significant provisions changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the aca as well as judicial interpretations in response to constitutional and other legal challenges as well as the uncertainty generated by such actual or potential challenges could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

among the most significant of the acas provisions was the establishment of the health insurance marketplace for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage that included a minimum level of benefits and restrictions on coverage limitations and premium rates as well as the expansion of medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the department of health and human services the hhs additionally indicated that it would consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion several states in which we operate have obtained section 1115 waivers to implement the acas medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law with additional states pursuing section 1115 waivers regarding eligibility criteria benefits and costsharing and provider payments across their medicaid programs litigation challenging section 1115 waiver activity for both new and previously approved waivers is expected to continue both through administrative actions and the courts 

there have been significant efforts from the previous administration to repeal or amend certain provisions of the aca through changes in regulations such initiatives included repeal of the individual mandate effective in 2019 as well as easing the regulatory restrictions placed on shortterm health plans and association health plans ahps which plans often provide fewer benefits than the traditional aca insurance benefits 

additionally the us department of labor issued a final rule on june 19 2018 which expanded flexibility regarding the regulation and formation of ahps provided by small employer groups and associations on june 13 2019 the hhs the us department of labor and the us treasury issued a final rule allowing employers of all sizes that do not offer a group coverage plan to fund a new kind of health reimbursement arrangement hra known as an individual coverage hra ichra beginning january 1 2020 employees became able to use employerfunded ichras to buy individualmarket insurance including insurance purchased on the public exchanges formed under the aca 

it remains uncertain whether the current administration will propose changes to restrict these insurance plan options that are not required to meet aca requirements and what the impact of such potential changes may be there have also been efforts by the previous administration to address the acas nondeductible tax imposed on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the hif congress passed a spending bill in december 2019 which repealed the health insurance tax indefinitely effective in 2021 

the constitutionality of the aca itself continues to face judicial challenge the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation or litigation and the outcome of other lawsuits cannot be predicted and may be delayed as a result of court closures and reduced court dockets as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

in contrast to previous executive and legislative efforts to restrict or limit certain provisions of the aca the american rescue act enacted on march 11 2021 contained provisions aimed at leveraging medicaid and the health insurance marketplace to expand health insurance coverage and affordability to consumers the american rescue act authorized an additional 19 trillion in federal spending to address the covid19 public health emergency and contained several provisions designed to increase coverage of certain healthcare services expand eligibility and benefits incentivize state medicaid expansion and adjust federal financing for state medicaid programs the ultimate impact of which remain uncertain the american rescue act enhanced eligibility for the advance premium tax credit for certain enrollees in the health insurance marketplace currently expires on december 31 2022 and if it is not extended our health insurance marketplace membership may be reduced 

these changes and other potential changes involving the functioning of the health insurance marketplace as a result of additional new legislation regulation executive action or litigation including those related to extending enrollment periods increasing eligibility in the program design changing the eligibility and amount of the advanced premium tax credit and expanding navigator services could impact our business and results of operations adversely or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state or federal level in the united states or internationally may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state local and international governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

we are often required to maintain a minimum hbr or share profits in excess of certain levels which may be retroactive in certain circumstances our plans have returned premiums back to the states enrollees or other beneficiaries in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement the amount of premium returned may include transparent pharmacy pricing and rebate initiatives other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards regulators require numerous steps for continued implementation of the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of potentially more onerous federal regulations if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected for example under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan 

in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others on november 13 2020 cms finalized revisions to the medicaid managed care regulations many of which became effective in december 2020 while not a wholesale revision of the 2016 regulations the november 2020 final rule adopted changes in areas including network adequacy beneficiary protections quality oversight and the establishment of capitation rates and payment policies although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa any failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefits management and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product and magellan health these businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that among other requirements govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers for example in march 2021 the state of ohio filed a civil action against us the complaint alleged breaches of contract with the ohio department of medicaid relating to the provision of pbm services and violations of ohio law relating to such contracts including among other things by i seeking payment for services already reimbursed ii not accurately disclosing to the ohio department of medicaid the true cost of the pbm services and iii inflating dispensing fees for prescription drugs we have reached nofault agreements with the attorneys general of nine states including ohio to resolve claims made by the states related to services provided by envolve our pharmacy benefits manager subsidiary as a result of the settlement the ohio attorney general’s litigation against us was dismissed additionally we are in discussions to bring final resolution to these concerns in other affected states consistent with those discussions we recorded a reserve estimate of 1250 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to this issue inclusive of the above settlements and rebates that we determined in the course of the matter are payable across our products notwithstanding such settlement and other ongoing discussions additional claims reviews or investigations relating to our pbm business may still be brought by other states the federal government or shareholder litigants and there is no guarantee we will have the ability to settle such claims with other states within the reserve estimate we have recorded and on other acceptable terms or at all 

we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures and regulators regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the structuring of rebates and pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have been and may from time to time become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management and could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims related to network adequacy claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions protests and appeals related to medicaid procurement awards employmentrelated disputes including wage and hour claims submissions to state agencies related to payments or state false claims acts and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application for example in march 2021 the state of ohio filed a civil action against us the complaint alleged breaches of contract with the ohio department of medicaid relating to the provision of pbm services and violations of ohio law relating to such contracts including among other things by i seeking payment for services already reimbursed ii not accurately disclosing to the ohio department of medicaid the true cost of the pbm services and iii inflating dispensing fees for prescription drugs we have reached nofault agreements with the attorneys general of nine states including ohio to resolve claims made by the states related to services provided by envolve our pharmacy benefits manager subsidiary as a result of the settlement the ohio attorney general’s litigation against us was dismissed additionally we are in discussions to bring final resolution to these concerns in other affected states consistent with those discussions we recorded a reserve estimate of 1250 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to this issue inclusive of the above settlements and rebates that we determined in the course of the matter are payable across our products additional claims reviews or investigations relating to our pbm business may be brought by other states the federal government or shareholder litigants and there is no guarantee we will have the ability to settle such claims with other states within the reserve estimate we have recorded and on other acceptable terms or at all in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal state and international laws regulations rules and contractual requirements regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 the grammleachbliley act and the european unions general data protection regulation which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date for example in 2021 we learned that accellion a thirdparty data transfer provider with whom we contract had a system vulnerability that resulted in unauthorized access to certain sensitive data of our customers including protected health information as well as unauthorized access to the data of several of accellion’s other clients this incident led to putative class action lawsuits that were filed against us and our subsidiaries health net llc health net of california inc health net life insurance company health net community solutions inc and california health  wellness and accellion on behalf of the affected customers we do not believe that this incident is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and 

cash flows however there can be no assurance that this incident and other privacy or security breaches will not require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our business or reputation subject us to state federal or international agency review and result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies and established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud waste and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase the amount or application of penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with other companies involved in public healthcare programs have been and from time to time are the subject of federal and state fraud waste and abuse investigations the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services many states have fraud waste and abuse laws including false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback statute in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam relators private parties acting on the governments behalf federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to conditions in the financial markets and economy 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced furthermore covid19 has impacted and may continue to impact the global economy resulting in significant market volatility and fluctuating interest rates as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption including due to the effects of covid19 the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance 

our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing revolving credit facility 

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if one or any combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 we had consolidated indebtedness of 188 billion we may further increase our indebtedness in the future 

this may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility and term loan facility collectively the company credit facility and the indentures governing our notes require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make certain investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our company credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum debttoebitda ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under our company credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and the phasing out of libor may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or our results of operations or financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 borrowings under our company credit facility bear interest based upon various reference rates including libor which is in the process of being phased out the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor banks currently reporting information used to set us dollar libor are currently expected to stop doing so during 2023 and in 2021 the us federal reserve board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than december 31 2021 

while various bodies including government agencies are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor including the secured overnight financing rate sofr there is uncertainty regarding which alternative reference rate will replace libor we may need to amend certain agreements that use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of the discontinuation or modification of libor alternative reference rates or other reforms could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

mergers and acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected cost and revenue synergies or growth in earnings the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected or if any financing related to the acquisitions is on unfavorable terms the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the 

acquisitions including the magellan acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our existing business with acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions 

the success of acquisitions we make will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the existing business of centene with such acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combinations if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of acquired businesses including magellan health with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the integration may result in material challenges including without limitation 

• the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of managements attention to the integration 

• managing a larger company 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations 

• unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems 

• unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations including the aca and any regulations enacted thereunder 

• unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition andor integration 

• achieving actual cost savings at the anticipated levels and 

• decreases in premiums paid under government sponsored healthcare programs by any state in which we operate 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows our ability to successfully manage the expanded business following any given acquisition including the magellan acquisition will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent standalone companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations as a result of acquisitions or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business is still consistent with our business strategy or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that asset or business when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our business strategy further divestitures may be delayed due to failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or may become more difficult to execute due to conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction we might have financial exposure in a divested business such as through minority equity ownership financial or performance guarantees indemnities or other obligations such that conditions outside of our control might negate the expected benefits of the disposition we could also incur higher costs or charges than planned or incur unexpected charges and could experience greater dissynergies than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

general risk factors 

future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock 

we may from time to time issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions we often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board of directors may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock

executive overview 

general 

we are a leading multinational healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives we take a local approach  with local brands and local teams  to provide fully integrated highquality and costeffective services to governmentsponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and selling general and administrative sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the health benefits ratio hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee hif revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed 

prior to 2021 before the affordable care act aca health insurer fee repeal was effected our insurance subsidiaries were subject to the hif we recognized revenue for reimbursement of the hif including the grossup to reflect the nondeductibility of the hif collectively this revenue was recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif were not passthrough payments and were recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations due to the size of the health insurer fee one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to the repeal of the hif in 2021 

magellan acquisition 

on january 4 2022 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of magellan health inc magellan total consideration for the acquisition was approximately 26 billion consisting of 25 billion in cash 9500 per share and an estimated 67 million related to the fair value replacement equity awards associated with precombination service the magellan acquisition enables us to provide wholehealth integrated healthcare solutions to deliver better health outcomes at lower costs for complex highcost populations 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in june 2019 we acquired 40 of circle health one of the uk’s largest independent operators of hospitals the initial 40 investment was accounted for as an equity method investment in july 2021 we acquired the remaining 60 interest of circle health for 705 million beginning in july 2021 we consolidate 100 of circle health 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we acquired pantherx and apixio pantherx is one of the largest and fastestgrowing specialty pharmacies in the united states specializing in orphan drugs and treating rare diseases pantherx and its management team operate independently as part of our envolve pharmacy solutions business unit apixio is a healthcare analytics company offering artificial intelligence technology solutions apixio remains an operationally independent entity as part of our health care enterprises group bringing value to its clients and the industry while also realizing the benefits of enhanced scale 

one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section are related to the acquisitions of circle health and pantherx 

in december 2021 we sold a majority stake in us medical management llc usmm and recognized a pretax gain of 150 million we believe this best positions usmm to expand its reach and impact while helping us to deliver on our value 

creation plan we used proceeds from the divestiture of usmm and cash on hand to repurchase 24 million shares of centene common stock for 200 million 

value creation plan 

as introduced in june 2021 the value creation plan is designed to drive margin expansion by leveraging our scale and generating sustainable profitable growth in order to execute the value creation plan we created the value creation office which includes members of executive leadership the three major pillars of the value creation plan are sga expense savings gross margin expansion and strategic capital management the first pillar sga expense savings includes initiatives targeting improving productivity driving efficiencies and reducing costs throughout the organization including real estate optimization the second pillar gross margin expansion will be achieved through initiatives including bid discipline clinical initiatives quality improvement and pharmacy cost management the third pillar strategic capital management focuses on valuecreating capital deployment activities such as share repurchases portfolio optimization and debt and investment management 

covid19 trends and uncertainties 

the covid19 outbreak has created unique and unprecedented challenges in 2020 we saw significant decreases in traditional utilization as stayathome orders were put in place partially offset by covid19 treatment costs as stayathome orders were lifted and vaccinations became available in 2021 utilization has returned in varying degrees as a result one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to covid19 in 2021 we launched several initiatives which encourage our health plan members as well as all americans to receive the covid19 vaccine 

the impact of covid19 on our business in both the shortterm and longterm is uncertain and difficult to predict the outlook for 2022 depends on future developments including but not limited to the length and severity of the outbreak including new variants which may be more contagious more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines the effectiveness of containment actions the timing and effectiveness of vaccinations and achievement of herd immunity and the timing and rate at which members return to accessing healthcare the pandemic and these future developments have impacted and will continue to affect our membership and medical utilization from march 31 2020 through december 31 2021 our medicaid membership has increased by 25 million members excluding the new north carolina membership in addition the pandemic has and continues to have the potential to impact the administration of state and federal healthcare programs premium rates and risk sharing mechanisms we continue to have active dialogues with our state partners to ensure our rates are actuarially sound 

medical utilization continues to lack consistency and will be influenced by the intensity of additional waves of the pandemic we continue to watch external trends closely as covid19 costs could increase based upon macro trends new variants and additional waves of the pandemic could create new dynamics and uncertainties around our expectations 

we are confident we have the team systems expertise and financial strength to continue to effectively navigate this challenging pandemic landscape 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

the united states government politicians and healthcare experts continue to discuss and debate various elements of the united states healthcare model we remain focused on the promise of delivering access to high quality affordable healthcare to all of our members and believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of the changing healthcare landscape we have more than three decades of experience spanning seven presidents from both sides of the aisle in delivering highquality healthcare services on behalf of states and the federal government to underinsured and uninsured families commercial organizations and military families this expertise has allowed us to deliver cost effective services to our government sponsors and our members while healthcare experts maintain focus on personalized healthcare technology we continue to make strategic decisions to accelerate development of new software platforms and analytical capabilities we continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members customers and shareholders

total revenues increased 13 in the year ended december 31 2021 over the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to medicaid membership growth resulting from the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations membership growth in the medicare business our acquisitions of pantherx and circle health in 2021 and the commencement of our contracts in north carolina partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded approximately a net 25 composite increase across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2021 was 878 an increase of 160 basis points over the comparable period in 2020 the hbr for 2021 was negatively impacted by higher traditional medical utilization in the marketplace business higher testing and treatment costs associated with covid19 and the repeal of the health insurer fee the hbr in 2020 was favorably impacted by the aca risk corridor receivable settlement from the federal government based on the supreme court ruling in 2020 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 16 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily attributable to the acquisitions of pantherx and circle health which was partially offset by the expiration of the pharmacy contract with our previously divested illinois health plan 

the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2021 was 864 compared to 882 in 2020 the decrease in the cost of service ratio was driven by the acquisition of the circle health business which operates at a lower cost of service ratio

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

as of december 31 2021 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 140 billion compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 67 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 we received 15 billion of net dividends from our regulated subsidiaries for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners naic we estimate our risk based capital rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

under the california knoxkeene health care service plan act of 1975 as amended knoxkeene certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity tne requirements under these knoxkeene tne requirements actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures excluding capitated amounts

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding intangible assets medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights and customer relationships provider contracts trade names developed technologies and goodwill key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include but are not limited to member attrition rates contract renewal probabilities revenue growth rates expectations of profitability and discount and royalty rates we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2021 we had 198 billion of goodwill and 78 billion of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership financial performance state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors 

we do not believe any of our reporting units are currently at risk for impairment however as part of our value creation plan we are completing a portfolio review and may identify changes in strategic focus which could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangibles based on market indicators at that time 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate the claims amounts ultimately settled will most likely be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims that have been received or adjudicated as of the end of a reporting period relative to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs for that same period when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows  these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2021 data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 105 million for the year ended december 31 2021 excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a shorttail which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2021 will be known by the end of 2022 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately 492 million 86 million and 49 million of the incurred related to prior years was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of population health management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that population health management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis these initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the population health management initiative are not known by us additionally certain population health management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the population health management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of population health management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

• appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions other inpatient hospital admissions and observation admissions in accordance with interqual or other evidence based criteria or clinical policy 

• management of our preauthorization list monitoring for over utilized services and stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectables 

• emergency department program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals and members to steer nonemergent care to a more appropriate and cost effective setting through patient education onsite alternative urgent care settings etc 

• increased emphasis on care management and clinical rounding where nurse or social worker care managers assist selected high risk members with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patients specific healthcare needs 

• incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive multidisciplinary collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma 

• prenatal and infant health programs utilized such as our start smart for your baby program 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans premiums received from our members and cms for our medicare product and premiums from members of our commercial health plans in addition to member premium payments our marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from cms we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state or cms analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances including commercial plans our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or cms which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or cms for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the healthcare providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

for qualifying low income pdp members cms pays for some or all of the members monthly premium we receive certain part d prospective subsidy payments from cms for our pdp members as a fixed monthly per member amount based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year as reflected in our bids approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy a settlement payment is made between cms and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services for performancebased measures in our contracts revenue is recognized as data sufficient to measure performance is available we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract for the dods tricare program on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the tricare contract includes various performancebased measures for each of the measures an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date and revenue is recognized accordingly 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif the aca imposed the hif in 2014 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 the hif was suspended in 2017 and 2019 beginning in 2021 the hif was permanently repealed if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the grossup to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif are not passthrough payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

some states require state directed payments that have minimal risk but are administered as a premium adjustment these payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100 hbr we have little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by the state 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2021 we had shortterm investments of 15 billion and longterm investments of 151 billion including restricted deposits of 11 billion the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities equity securities and private equity investments and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2021 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 365 million declines in interest rates over time including those that have occurred as markets experienced volatility related to the covid19 pandemic will reduce our investment income 

we have a foreign currency swap for a notional amount of 705 million with a creditworthy financial institution to manage foreign exchange risk related to a great british pound denominated note receivable from a consolidated international subsidiary as a result the fair value of the swap varies with foreign exchange rate fluctuations assuming a 1 increase in the great british pound to us dollar foreign exchange rate at december 31 2021 the fair value of our swap would decrease by approximately 7 million an increase in the us dollar to great british pound foreign exchange rate decreases the fair value of the swap and conversely a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate increases the value the offsetting changes in fair value of the foreign currency swap and the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany note receivable were both recognized in investment and other income in the consolidated statements of operations the company does not hold or issue any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors – our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity

industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid medicare and commercial products we currently have operations domestically and internationally 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided by the federal government each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment 

rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 

under the affordable care act aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level subject to the states elections the federal government paid the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 95 of the costs in 2017 94 of the costs in 2018 93 of the costs in 2019 and 90 of the costs in 2020 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in subsequent years the federal share is scheduled to remain at 90 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act the aged blind or disabled abd program covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created the state childrens health insurance program chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

longterm services and supports ltss is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltss services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state medicaid ltss benefits the largest groups receiving ltss by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance and other populations states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltss beneficiaries according to advancing states formerly national association of states united for aging and disabilities as of november 2020 25 states utilize some form of managed ltss up from eight in 2004 

the majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for medicaid most commonly through title ive of the social security act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes the federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state medicaid in addition the aca requires states to make former foster care children eligible for medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in medicaid at that time 

cms estimated the total medicaid market to be approximately 649 billion in 2020 and estimates the market will grow to over 10 trillion by 2028 medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 45 in 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 57 between 2020 and 2028 due to the timing of the cms report and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic the aforementioned projections do not take into account the impact of covid19 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 110 million dualeligible enrollees in 2019 these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltss medicaremedicaid plans mmp medicare advantage dual special needs plan dsnp and standard medicare advantage lines of business 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments which is typically more expensive as a result many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe managed care has improved the quality of care for medicaid beneficiaries and lowered costs the majority of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid populations 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups the medicare program provides health care coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older as well as to individuals with certain disabilities 

we provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits as our medicare advantage members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star ratings calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 

cms estimated the total medicare market was approximately 859 billion in 2020 and estimates the market will grow to approximately 16 trillion by 2028 medicare spending is estimated to have increased 72 in fiscal 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 77 between 2020 and 2028 

medicare prescription drug plan 

through our acquisition of wellcare in january 2020 we now offer standalone pdp to medicare beneficiaries we have contracted with cms to serve as a plan sponsor offering standalone medicare part d pdp plans to medicareeligible beneficiaries we offer pdps in 50 states and the district of columbia our pdps offer national innetwork prescription drug coverage including a preferred pharmacy network subject to limitations in certain circumstances 

our pdp contracts with cms are renewable for successive oneyear terms unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the current contract year or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

the medicare part d prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs the government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage adjusted for risk factor payments additional subsidies are provided for duallyeligible beneficiaries and specified lowincome beneficiaries 

commercial 

established in 2010 and operational in 2014 the aca created health insurance marketplaces which are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating 

their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes generally between 100400 of the federal poverty level with some exceptions to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

w e also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups we offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers coverage typically is subject to copays and can be subject to deductibles and coinsurance as our commercial members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year

providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery cost management and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 

• under our feeforservice contracts with providers we pay a negotiated fee for covered services this model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider 

• under our capitated contracts providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements a provider groups financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group depending on state law and the regulatory environment it may be necessary for us to pay such claims 

• under valuebased arrangements providers can be paid under either a capitated or feeforservice model the arrangement however contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon their performance in cost and quality measures 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract services are provided on a feeforservice basis 

we often start our provider relationships in a payforperformance arrangement before we transition to a risksharing arrangement which is based on the total cost of care as we advance along this continuum it strengthens our partnerships with our providers enabling the delivery of high quality care 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and population health management programs our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative 

burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn has helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

• provider engagement performance tools and processes lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes healthcare costs and member satisfaction high quality and service levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performancebased measures to select and pay health plans we have a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panels we meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcomes our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their valuebased contract 

• integrated care model is membercentric and managed by one care manager assigned to a member who looks at the total care for the member in a holistic manner this single care manager will coordinate all care for that member including behavioral health medical health and homebased primary care in accordance with an individualized integrated care plan this care manager also coordinates meetings with the members integrated care team to assess and alter the care plan as needed this results in better outcomes and improvement in member satisfaction 

• provider portal provides claims and eligibility research prior authorizations member panels care gaps patient analytics and provider analytics meant to drive provider engagement and improved patient outcomes data and reporting are delivered via a secure userfriendly webbased provider portal this is provided through our suite of proprietary technology developed by interpreta apixio and casenet 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and population health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the population health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as care management software dental benefits management homebased primary care services life and population health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management 

our population health programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these programs include 

• use of nationally recognized interqual or milliman criteria to help ensure our members receive the right level of care in the most appropriate setting 

• preauthorized highrisk medication and services that are commonly over or inappropriately prescribed 

• member education and the provision of appropriate and easily accessed urgent care services to help members avoid unnecessary and costly emergency department visits and improve their healthcare experience 

• emphasis on care management and care coordination where clinicians such as nurses and social workers who are employed to assist highrisk and other selected members with the coordination of healthcare services that meet their specific needs 

• disease management for chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes through a comprehensive multidisciplinary and collaborative approach 

• prenatal case management for those with highrisk pregnancies to help them deliver fullterm healthy infants and 

• pharmacy treatment compliance programs driven by evidencebased clinical policies and focused on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose delivered in an efficient format and utilized for the correct duration 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by health plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we have achieved accreditation in 30 of 33 eligible states for at least one product medicare medicaid or commercial including health insurance marketplace

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes including business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level this includes but is not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

• national and regional commercial managed care organizations that focus on providing healthcare services to medicaid medicare and correctional members in addition to members in marketplace and private commercial plans these organizations consist of national and regional organizations as well as notforprofits and organizations that operate in a small geographic location and are owned by providers primarily hospitals some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management behavioral health management population health management correctional healthcare management and nurse triage call support centers 

• primary care case management programs that are established by the states through contracts with primary care providers under these programs physicians provide primary care services to medicaid recipients as well as limited population health management oversight 

• accountable care organizations that consist of groups of doctors hospitals and other healthcare providers who come together to provide coordinated high quality care to their patients 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state county federal and commercial contracts in addition the impact of the aca and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates population health management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve    

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product we believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at the local state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction states have implemented national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting states have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations hmos and insurance companies we are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators 

regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration remains uncertain 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments 

departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan prescription drug plan pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions for example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

• premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us 

• stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time 

• disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures and 

• programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

additionally the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid and medicare programs our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

the aca transformed the us healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business in december 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the acas individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid ie that it was not severable from the aca that decision was appealed to the fifth circuit which ruled in december 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability the supreme court heard oral arguments in november 2020 and a ruling is anticipated in 2021 the aca remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded for a further discussion of the aca see risk factors  the implementation of the aca as well as potential repeal of changes to or judicial challenges to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows  

we must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment to ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state 

we provide medicare advantage pdps dsnps and mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 

• eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes 

• covered services 

• eligible providers 

• subcontractors 

• recordkeeping and record retention 

• periodic financial and informational reporting 

• quality assurance 

• accreditation 

• health education and wellness and prevention programs 

• timeliness of claims payment 

• financial standards 

• safeguarding of member information

• organization and administrative systems 

a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years the contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 22 states under federallyfacilitated marketplace contracts with cms and statebased exchanges both contract types are renewable on an annual basis 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act the general data protection regulation gdpr in the european union eu and state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement 

authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified in october 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we must maintain compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at medicare medicaid health insurance marketplace and commercial products the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act additional fraud waste and abuse prohibitions include a wide range of operating activities such as kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans pdps and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud waste and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment

risks relating to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health pandemics such as the spread of covid19  

public health pandemics or widespread outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 emerged which has now spread globally including throughout the united states the extent to which covid19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence factors that may determine the severity of the impact include the duration and scale of the outbreak new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 including new strains which may be more contagious more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines the costs of prevention and treatment of covid19 and the potential that we will not receive state and federal government reimbursement of additional expenses incurred by our members who contract or require testing for covid19 or who experience other health impacts as a result of the pandemic employee mobility productivity and utilization of leave and other benefits financial and other impacts on the healthcare provider community disruptions or delays in the supply chain for testing and treatment supplies protective equipment and other products and services and the actions to contain covid19 or address its impact including federal state and local laws regulations and emergency orders including directives to remain at home physically distance or forced business closures as well as the timing and scope of vaccine distribution among others additionally the spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which could adversely impact our access to capital and a decline in interest rates which could reduce our investment income finally the impact of the above items on our state and federal partners could result in program changes or delays or reduced capitation payments to us we cannot at this time predict the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic but it could adversely affect our business including our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of unique risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions penalties or other actions if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are modified or terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance for example in october 2020 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published updated medicare star quality ratings for the 2021 rating year approximately 30 of our medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2022 bonus year compared to 46 for the 2021 bonus year and 86 for the 2020 bonus year our quality bonus and rebates may be negatively impacted in 2021 and 2022 and the attractiveness of our medicare advantage plans may be reduced 

there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

although we do not anticipate that a singlepayer national health insurance system will be enacted by the current congress members of congress have proposed several legislative initiatives over various sessions of congress that would establish some 

form of a single public or quasipublic agency that organizes healthcare financing but under which healthcare delivery would remain private additionally the potential impact of the change of administration on healthcare reform efforts is unknown we are unable to predict the nature and success of these or other initiatives or political changes which could have an adverse effect on our business 

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expenses exceed our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent diseases such as covid19 new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits also member behavior could continue to be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the aca including ongoing legal challenges to the aca including the case originally captioned texas v united states which is currently pending before the supreme court 

our medical expenses include claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region or launch a new product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

riskadjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to estimate and could result in retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

most of our government customers employ riskadjustment models to determine the premium amount they pay for each member this model pays more for members with predictably higher costs according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled premium payments are generally established at fixed intervals according to the contract terms and then adjusted on a retroactive basis we reassess the estimates of the risk adjustment settlements each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue in addition revisions by our government customers to the riskadjustment models have reduced and may continue to reduce our premium revenue 

as a result of the variability of certain factors that determine estimates for riskadjusted premiums including plan risk scores the actual amount of retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates consequently our estimate of our plans’ risk scores for any period and any resulting change in our accrual of premium revenues related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the data provided to our government customers to determine the risk score are subject to audit by them even after the annual settlements occur these audits may result in the refund of premiums to the government customer previously received by us which could be significant and would reduce our premium revenue in the year that repayment is required 

government customers have performed and continue to perform audits of selected plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each member in 2018 cms proposed the removal of the fee for service adjuster from the risk adjustment data validation audit methodology if adopted this proposal or any similar cms rule making initiative could increase our audit error scores we anticipate that cms will continue to conduct audits of our medicare contracts and contract years on an ongoing basis an audit may result in the refund of premiums to cms it is likely that a payment adjustment could occur as a result of these audits and any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

any failure to adequately price products offered or any reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

due to among other things the elimination of the individual mandate penalty in the tax cuts and jobs act tcja we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether in addition the risk adjustment provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product are subject to a high degree of estimation and variability and are affected by our members acuity relative to the membership acuity of other insurers further changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured or require us to increase premium rates any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we derive a portion of our cash flow and gross margin from our pdp operations for which we submit annual bids for participation the results of our bids could materially affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a significant portion of our pdp membership is obtained from the autoassignment of beneficiaries in cmsdesignated regions where our pdp premium bids are below benchmarks of other plans’ bids in general our premium bids are based on assumptions regarding pdp membership utilization drug costs drug rebates and other factors for each region our 2021 pdp bids resulted in 33 of the 34 cms regions in which we were below the benchmarks and within the de minimis range in the remaining region compared with our 2020 pdp bids in which we were below the benchmarks in 32 regions and within the de minimis range in the remaining two regions for those regions in which we are within the de minimis range we will not be eligible to have new members autoassigned to us but we will not lose our existing autoassigned membership 

if our future part d premium bids are not below the cms benchmarks we risk losing pdp members who were previously assigned to us and we may not have additional pdp members autoassigned to us which could materially reduce our revenue and profits 

our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs 

our contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and to set premium rates we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and continue to be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance in some instances our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit there also may be periods of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements in either case it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data 

we may experience challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could adversely affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us and subject us to financial penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with government entities expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality star ratings or required changes to the way we do business in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent thirdparty vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plans enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements either new programs to determine eligibility or new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or when it chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand into new geographies and complementary business lines as well as to augment existing operations and we may be in discussions with respect to one or multiple targets at any given time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates including those related to stayathome directives and other impacts of covid19 as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability the timing of operating our new east coast headquarters in charlotte and the expected benefits of its completion may also be negatively impacted as a result of these factors in addition we are planning to further expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy including as a result of the continued impact of covid19 our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and diversify our business in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by third parties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations in addition to state corporate law limitations these subsidiaries are subject to more stringent state insurance and hmo laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny or delay our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a significant portion of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for a significant portion of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors in addition the administration of the aca has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing 

flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of and access to services be able to provide effective telehealth services maintain financial solvency including due to the impact of covid19 or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example our wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company hnl is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnls payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our managements attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists which may include cyberattacks by terrorists or other governmental or nongovernmental actors in addition we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of prevention and detection controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

risks relating to regulatory and legal matters 

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging approximately 60 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with federal and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state governments to terminate or modify contracts with them in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity and other regulatory legislative or judicial actions that may have an impact on the operations of government subsidized healthcare programs including ongoing litigation involving the aca for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 sequestration subject to a 2 cap which was extended by the bipartisan budget act of 2019 through 2029 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act of 2020 temporarily suspended the medicare sequestration for the period of may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 while also extending the mandatory sequestration policy by an additional one year through 2030 the bipartisanbicameral omnibus covid relief deal passed in december 2020 further extended the suspension of the medicare sequestration until march 31 2021 

in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of one or more contracts for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if another federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs for example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the implementation of the aca as well as potential repeal of changes to or judicial challenges to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows  

the enactment of the aca in march 2010 transformed the us healthcare delivery system through a series of complex initiatives however the implementation of the aca continues to face administrative judicial and legislative challenges to repeal or change certain of its significant provisions changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the aca as well as judicial interpretations in response to constitutional and other legal challenges as well as the uncertainty generated by such actual or potential challenges could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows even if the aca is not amended or repealed under the current administration a future administration or members of congress could continue to propose changes impacting implementation of the aca which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations 

among the most significant of the acas provisions was the establishment of the health insurance marketplace for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage that included a minimum level of benefits and restrictions on coverage limitations and premium rates as well as the expansion of medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the hhs additionally indicated that it would consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion arkansas was the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning on january 1 2014 several states have obtained section 1115 waivers to implement the acas medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law with additional states pursuing section 1115 waivers regarding eligibility criteria benefits and costsharing and provider payments across their medicaid programs litigation challenging section 1115 waiver activity for both new and previously approved waivers is expected to continue both through administrative actions and the courts 

there have been significant administrative efforts to repeal or limit implementation of certain provisions of the aca through changes in regulations such initiatives include repeal of the individual mandate effective in 2019 as well as easing the regulatory restrictions placed on shortterm health plans and association health plans ahps which plans often provide fewer benefits than the traditional aca insurance benefits 

additionally the us department of labor issued a final rule on june 19 2018 which expanded flexibility regarding the regulation and formation of ahps provided by small employer groups and associations on june 13 2019 the hhs the us department of labor and the us treasury issued a final rule allowing employers of all sizes that do not offer a group coverage plan to fund a new kind of health reimbursement arrangement hra known as an individual coverage hra ichra beginning january 1 2020 employees became able to use employerfunded ichras to buy individualmarket insurance including insurance purchased on the public exchanges formed under the aca 

in addition to administrative efforts to expand the flexibility of other insurance plan options that are not required to meet aca requirements there have also been efforts to address the acas nondeductible tax imposed on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the aca imposed hif was 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter the hif payable in 2017 was suspended by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2016 however a 143 billion payment occurred in 2018 collection of the hif for 2019 was also suspended but resumed in 2020 with a 155 billion payment congress passed a spending bill in december 2019 which would repeal the health insurance tax indefinitely effective in 2021 if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the hif including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address the current assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the constitutionality of the aca itself continues to face judicial challenge in december 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the acas individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid ie that it was not severable from the aca that decision was appealed to the fifth circuit which ruled in december 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after congress set the individual mandate penalty to 0 and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability in march 2020 the us supreme court agreed to hear the case to review whether the individual mandate is constitutional and if the individual mandate is unconstitutional the severability issue in june 2020 noel j francisco the then solicitor general of the united states together with multiple us department of justice colleagues submitted a brief to the us supreme court supporting the argument that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the remaining provisions of the aca are not severable the us supreme court heard oral arguments in november 2020 and a ruling is anticipated in 2021 the aca remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation or the outcome of the lawsuit cannot be predicted and may be delayed as a result of court closures and reduced court dockets as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

these changes and other potential changes involving the functioning of the health insurance marketplace as a result of new legislation regulation executive action or litigation could impact our business and results of operations 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state or federal level in the united states or internationally may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premiums back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement factors that may impact the amount of premium returned to the state include transparent pharmacy pricing and rebate initiatives other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards regulators require numerous steps for continued implementation of the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of potentially more onerous federal regulations if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected for example under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan 

in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others cms subsequently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on november 8 2018 advancing cms efforts to streamline the medicaid and chip managed care regulatory framework and to pursue a broader strategy to relieve regulatory burdens support state flexibility and local leadership and promote transparency flexibility and innovation in the delivery of care on november 13 2020 cms finalized revisions to the medicaid managed care regulations many of which became effective in december 2020 while not a wholesale revision of the 2016 regulations the november 2020 final rule adopts changes in areas including network adequacy beneficiary protections quality oversight and the establishment of capitation rates and payment policies although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa any failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product these businesses are subject to federal and state laws that among other requirements govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures and regulators regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the structuring of rebates and pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in 

the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions protests and appeals related to medicaid procurement awards employmentrelated disputes including wage and hour claims submissions to state agencies related to payments or state false claims acts and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal state and international laws regulations rules and contractual requirements regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 the grammleachbliley act and the european unions general data protection regulation which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date for example in january 2021 we learned that accellion a thirdparty data transfer provider with whom we contract had a system vulnerability that resulted in unauthorized access to certain sensitive data of our customers including protected health information over a period of several days in january 2021 as well as unauthorized access to the data of several of accellion’s other clients this incident is still under investigation but we currently do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows however there can be no assurance that the january 2021 incident and other privacy or security breaches will not require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our business or reputation subject us to state federal or international agency review and result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies and established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud waste and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase the amount or application of penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of federal and state fraud waste and abuse investigations the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services many states have fraud waste and abuse laws including false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback statute in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam relators private parties acting on the governments behalf federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to conditions in the financial markets and economy 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced furthermore covid19 has impacted and may continue to impact the global economy resulting in significant market volatility and fluctuating interest rates as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has increased due to the effects of covid19 the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if one or any combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2020 we had consolidated indebtedness of 16779 million we intend to incur additional indebtedness to finance a portion of the consideration for the magellan acquisition and we may further increase our indebtedness in the future 

this may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility and term loan facility collectively the company credit facility and the indentures governing our notes require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations 

including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make certain investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our company credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum debttoebitda ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or our results of operations or financial condition 

as of december 31 2020 borrowings under our company credit facility bear interest based upon various reference rates including libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of libor announced plans to consult on ceasing the publication of certain us dollar libor rates on december 31 2021 and to extend the transition for other us dollar libor rates to june 2023 the us federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new us dollar libor issuances by the end of 2021 in light of these recent announcements the future of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to the phasing out of libor could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate sofr the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain as a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

mergers and acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earning per share which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions including the magellan acquisition if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected cost and revenue synergies or growth in earnings the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected or if any financing related to the acquisitions is on unfavorable terms the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions including the magellan acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our existing business with acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions 

the success of acquisitions we make including the magellan acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the existing business of centene with such acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combinations if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of acquired businesses including magellan health with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the integration may result in material challenges including without limitation 

• the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of managements attention to the integration 

• managing a larger company 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations 

• unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems 

• unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations including the aca and any regulations enacted thereunder 

• unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition andor integration 

• achieving actual cost savings at the anticipated levels and 

• decreases in premiums paid under government sponsored healthcare programs by any state in which we operate 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows our ability to successfully manage the expanded business following any given acquisition including the magellan acquisition will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent standalone companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations as a result of acquisitions or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

the financing arrangements that we entered into in connection with the wellcare acquisition may under certain circumstances contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

we incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with the wellcare acquisition certain of the agreements governing the indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the wellcare acquisition contains covenants that among other things may under certain circumstances place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to 

• payments in respect of or redemptions or acquisitions of debt or equity issued by us or our subsidiaries including the payment of dividends on our common stock 

• incurring additional indebtedness 

• incurring guarantee obligations 

• paying dividends 

• creating liens on assets 

• entering into sale and leaseback transactions 

• making investments loans or advances 

• entering into hedging transactions 

• engaging in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of their respective assets and 

• engaging in certain transactions with affiliates 

in addition we are required to maintain a minimum amount of excess availability as set forth in these agreements 

our ability to maintain minimum excess availability in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control the ability to comply with this covenant in future periods will also depend on our ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize the anticipated benefits of the wellcare acquisition including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing 

additional risks associated with the magellan acquisition 

the merger with magellan health is subject to conditions some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis if at all failure to complete the merger with magellan health could have adverse effects on our business 

the completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions including among others the receipt of us federal antitrust clearance and certain other required state regulatory approvals which make the completion of the magellan acquisition and timing thereof uncertain also either we or magellan health may terminate the merger agreement merger agreement if the magellan acquisition is not consummated by october 4 2021 subject to an automatic extension to january 4 2022 in certain circumstances except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform in any material respect any obligation under the merger agreement has been the proximate cause of the failure of the merger to be consummated on or before that date 

if the magellan acquisition is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits that we could have realized had the magellan acquisition been completed we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• the market price of our common stock could decline 

• inability to secure financing 

• if the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors board seeks another business combination our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into any transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that we and magellan health have agreed to in the merger agreement 

• time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the magellan acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities 

• we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers or employees and 

• we will be required to pay our costs relating to the magellan acquisition such as legal accounting financial advisory and printing fees whether or not the magellan acquisition is completed 

in addition if the magellan acquisition is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the magellan acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if any such risk materializes it could adversely impact our ongoing business 

similarly delays in the completion of the magellan acquisition could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the magellan acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the magellan acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe we cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the magellan acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the magellan acquisition will be consummated 

centene and magellan health may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the magellan acquisition from being completed 

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements even if the lawsuits are without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources an adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on centene’s and magellan health’s respective liquidity and financial condition additionally if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the magellan acquisition then that injunction may delay or prevent the magellan acquisition from being completed or from being completed within the expected timeframe which may adversely affect centene’s business financial position and results of operation currently centene is not aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the magellan acquisition 

completion of the magellan acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which magellan health or its subsidiaries are a party which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations 

the completion of the magellan acquisition may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which magellan health or its subsidiaries are a party if we and magellan health are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages even if we and magellan health are able to negotiate waivers the counterparties may require a fee 

for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to magellan health or the combined company any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations 

general risk factors 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we may be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management team or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock 

we may from time to time issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions we often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board of directors may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock

executive overview 

general 

we are a leading multinational healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives we take a local approach  with local brands and local teams  to provide fully integrated highquality and costeffective services to governmentsponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and selling general and administrative sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the health benefits ratio hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual health insurer fee hif absent a hif moratorium or repeal we recognize revenue for reimbursement of the hif including the grossup to reflect the nondeductibility of the hif collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif are not passthrough payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations a moratorium suspended the hif for the 2019 calendar year due to the size of the health insurer fee one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to the reinstatement of the hif in 2020 the hif has been repealed beginning in 2021 

wellcare acquisition 

on january 23 2020 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of wellcare health plans inc wellcare the wellcare acquisition the transaction was valued at 196 billion including the assumption of 195 billion of outstanding debt the wellcare acquisition brought a highquality medicare platform and further extended our robust medicaid offerings the combination enables us to provide access to more comprehensive and differentiated solutions across more markets with a continued focus on affordable highquality culturallysensitive healthcare services 

due to the size of the acquisition one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to the acquisition of wellcare 

magellan acquisition 

in january 2021 we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire magellan health for 9500 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately 22 billion the transaction will broaden and deepen our whole health capabilities and establish a leading behavioral health platform the transaction is subject to clearance under the hartscott rodino act receipt of required state regulatory approvals the approval of the definitive merger agreement by magellan healths stockholders and other customary closing conditions the transaction is not contingent upon financing we intend to fund the acquisition primarily through debt financing the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021

we continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions during 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we acquired pantherx and apixio pantherx is one of the largest and fastestgrowing specialty pharmacies in the united states

covid19 trends and uncertainties 

the covid19 outbreak has created unique and unprecedented challenges to support our members providers employees and the communities we serve we have taken several actions and made numerous investments related to the covid19 crisis we have extended coverage of covid19 screening testing and treatment services for medicaid medicare and marketplace members and are waiving all associated member cost share amounts we are delivering new critical support to safety net providers including federally qualified healthcare centers fqhcs behavioral health providers and longterm service and support organizations we continue to address social determinants of health for vulnerable populations during the covid19 crisis with a commitment to research and investment in nonmedical barriers to achieving quality health outcomes we developed initiatives designed to support the disability community affected by the pandemic we created a provider support program to assist our network providers who are seeking benefits from the small business administration sba through the cares act we established a medical reserve leave policy to support clinical employees who want to join a medical reserve force and serve their communities during the covid19 pandemic we are providing additional employee benefits including waiving costsharing for covid19 related treatment emergency paid sick leave and onetime payments to employees in a small number of critical office functions 

we have taken significant steps to support our employees to protect their health and safety while also ensuring that our business can continue to operate and that services continue without disruption we have implemented our business continuity plans and have taken actions to support our workforce we have transitioned the vast majority of our employees to work from home allowing centene to continue to operate at close to full capacity while continuing to maintain our internal control framework as a result we have experienced and expect continued incremental costs due to investments and actions we have already taken and continued efforts to protect our members employees and communities we serve 

the impact on our business in both the shortterm and longterm is uncertain the outlook for 2021 depends on future developments including but not limited to the length and severity of the outbreak including new strains which may be more contagious more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines the effectiveness of containment actions and the timing around the development of treatments and distribution of vaccinations the pandemic and these future developments have impacted and will continue to affect our membership and medical utilization from march 31 2020 through december 31 2020 our medicaid membership has increased by 17 million members the pandemic also has the potential to impact the administration of state and federal healthcare programs premium rates and risk sharing mechanisms we continue to have active dialogues with our state partners 

medical utilization continues to normalize as elective procedures and other nonemergent care resume consistent with our expectations we have experienced and continue to expect incremental covid19 costs as the outbreak continues to spread in addition the pandemic has widespread economic impact driving interest rate decreases and lowering our investment income 

the impact of all these items slightly benefited our 2020 results we are confident we have the team systems expertise and financial strength to continue to effectively navigate this challenging pandemic landscape 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

the united states government politicians and healthcare experts continue to discuss and debate various elements of the united states healthcare model we remain focused on the promise of delivering access to high quality affordable healthcare to all of our members and believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of the changing healthcare landscape we have more than three decades of experience spanning seven presidents from both sides of the aisle in delivering highquality healthcare services on behalf of states and the federal government to underinsured and uninsured families commercial organizations and military families this expertise has allowed us to deliver cost effective services to our government sponsors and our members while healthcare experts maintain focus on personalized healthcare technology we continue to make strategic decisions to accelerate development of new software platforms and analytical capabilities we continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members customers and shareholders

total revenues 

the following table sets forth supplemental revenue information for the year ended december 31  in millions 



total revenues increased 49 in the year ended december 31 2020 over the corresponding period in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of wellcare growth in the medicaid and health insurance marketplace businesses and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020 additionally the net effect of the pandemic increased our revenues due to the suspension of medicaid eligibility redeterminations the increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our illinois health plan during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1 composite increase across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2020 was 862 a decrease of 110 basis points over the comparable period in 2019 the hbr decrease was primarily attributable to lower medical utilization trends due to the covid19 pandemic the aca risk corridor receivable settlement and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee the decrease was partially offset by performance in the health insurance marketplace business the implementation of retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk sharing mechanisms and higher testing and treatment costs associated with covid19 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 838 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 primarily attributable to increased volume in our specialty pharmacy business increased nonspecialty pharmacy sales to our recently divested illinois health plan and growth from acquired businesses 

the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2020 was 882 compared to 843 in 2019 the increase in the cost of service ratio was driven by the results of lower revenue from the shared savings programs in our physician home health business and higher nonspecialty pharmacy sales to our recently divested illinois health plan which carries a higher cost of service ratio 

selling general  administrative expenses 

sga increased by 33 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 the sga increase was primarily due to the addition of the wellcare business expansions new programs and growth in many of our states in 2020 and 580 million of acquisition related expense in the year ended december 31 2020 

table of contents 

the sga expense ratio was 95 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 93 for the year ended december 31 2019 the 2020 sga expense ratio increased due to higher acquisition and integration related expenses primarily due to the wellcare acquisition the 275 million charitable contribution to our foundation and enhanced growth and profitability initiatives for our medicare and health insurance marketplace businesses both as a result of the onetime aca risk corridor settlement these items were partially offset by leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of the wellcare acquisition 

the adjusted sga expense ratio was 89 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 92 for the year ended december 31 2019 the adjusted sga expense ratio benefited from leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of the wellcare acquisition partially offset by the 275 million charitable contribution to our foundation and enhanced growth and profitability initiatives for our medicare and health insurance marketplace businesses 

health insurer fee expense 

health insurer fee expense was 15 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2019 calendar year we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31 2019 

impairment 

during the first quarter of 2020 we recorded 72 million or 010 per diluted share of noncash impairment of our thirdparty care management software business in 2019 we recorded 271 million or 057 per diluted share of noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment substantially all of the 2019 impairment is associated with our usmm physician home health business and was identified as part of our quarterly review procedures which included an analysis of new information related to our shared savings programs slower than expected penetration of the physician home health business model into our medicaid population and the related impact to revised forecasts 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31  in millions 



investment and other income investment and other income increased by 37 million for year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase in investment income in 2020 was due to a 104 million gain related to the divestiture of certain products of our illinois health plan as part of the previously announced divestiture agreements associated with the wellcare acquisition as well as overall higher investment balances partially offset by lower interest rates 

debt extinguishment costs in october 2020 we redeemed all of the 10 billion 475 senior notes due 2022 the 2022 notes and the 12 billion 525 senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes we recognized a pretax loss on extinguishment of 17 million on the redemption of the 2022 notes and the 2025 notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 including the call premiums and writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs in february 2020 we redeemed all of our outstanding 10 billion 6125 senior notes due february 15 2024 the 2024 notes and recognized a pretax loss on extinguishment of 44 million the loss includes the call premium the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and the loss on the termination of the 10 billion interest rate swap associated with the 2024 notes in october 2019 we redeemed the outstanding principal balance on the 14 billion 5625 senior notes due february 15 2021 the 2021 notes we recognized a pretax loss on extinguishment of 30 million on the redemption of the 2021 notes including the call premium the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loss on the termination of the 600 million interest rate swap agreement associated with the notes 

interest expense interest expense increased by 316 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 the increase is driven by an increase in borrowings related to the issuance of an additional 70 billion in senior notes in december 2019 to finance the cash consideration of the wellcare acquisition as well as the 19 billion of wellcare notes assumed upon acquisition the increase was also driven by incremental interest expense related to our decision to preserve an additional 10 billion of liquidity due to the economic environment created by covid19 

table of contents 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded income tax expense of 979 million on pretax earnings of 28 billion or an effective tax rate of 353 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects the tax impact associated with the illinois divestiture and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020 partially offset by a favorable tax settlement for the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded income tax expense of 473 million on pretax earnings of 18 billion or an effective tax rate of 265 which reflects the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium partially offset by the nondeductibility of a portion of our noncash goodwill and intangible impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2019 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31  in millions 



managed care 

total revenues increased 50 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of wellcare growth in the medicaid and health insurance marketplace businesses and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020 additionally the net effect of the pandemic increased our revenues due to the suspension of medicaid eligibility redeterminations the increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our illinois health plan earnings from operations increased 12 billion between years driven by the acquisition of wellcare lower medical utilization due to the covid19 pandemic and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020 partially offset by higher acquisition related expenses retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk sharing mechanisms and higher testing and treatment costs associated with covid19 particularly in the health insurance marketplace business 

specialty services 

total revenues increased 17 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment acquisitions and increased volume in our specialty pharmacy business earnings from operations increased 76 million between years earnings from operations in 2020 was negatively affected by the previously discussed impairment related to our thirdparty care management software business and the results of the shared savings programs in our physician home health business earnings from operations in 2019 were negatively affected by the previously discussed noncash goodwill and intangible impairment related to our usmm physician home health business

cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2020 operating activities provided cash of 55 billion or 31 times net earnings compared to 15 billion in 2019 cash flow provided by operations in 2020 was due to net earnings an increase in medical claims liabilities from growth and expansions and an increase in other longterm liabilities related to minimum mlr payables and a delay in employer payroll tax payments related to the covid19 extensions to payment deadlines 

cash flows provided by operations in 2019 was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities primarily resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the commencement or expansion of the arkansas iowa new mexico and pennsylvania health plans operating cash flows were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables due to the timing of payments from our state customers as discussed below 

cash flows from operations in each year can be impacted by the timing of payments we receive from our states as we have seen historically states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period

during the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we received dividends of 13 billion and 713 million respectively from our regulated subsidiaries 

2021 expectations 

during 2021 we expect to receive net dividends of approximately 17 billion from our regulated subsidiaries and expect to spend approximately 860 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions in february 2021 our board of directors approved an increase in our existing share repurchase program for our common stock with the increase we are authorized to repurchase up to 10 billion of shares of our common stock inclusive of the previously approved stock repurchase program no duration has been placed on the repurchase program

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

as of december 31 2020 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 142 billion compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 59 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 we received 508 million of net dividends from our regulated subsidiaries for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners naic we estimate our risk based capital rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

under the california knoxkeene health care service plan act of 1975 as amended knoxkeene certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity tne requirements under these knoxkeene tne requirements actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures excluding capitated amounts in addition certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the department of managed health care to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking 

under the new york state department of health codes rules and regulations title 10 part 98 our new york subsidiary must comply with contingent reserve requirements under these requirements net worth based upon admitted assets must equal or exceed a minimum amount based on annual net premium income 

the naic has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2020 each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies such restrictions unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus statutory income and unassigned surplus as of december 31 2020 the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was 59 billion in the aggregate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding intangible assets medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights and customer relationships provider contracts trade names developed technologies and goodwill key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include but are not limited to member attrition rates contract renewal probabilities revenue growth rates expectations of profitability and discount and royalty rates we 

table of contents 

allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2020 we had 187 billion of goodwill and 84 billion of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership financial performance state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors 

our specialty clinical healthcare business acquired in 2018 with goodwill of 325 million has experienced shortterm decreased profitability due to shortterm rate inadequacies and the effect of the covid19 pandemic coupled with immigration restrictions enacted by policy administrators however the goodwill is expected to be recovered and there have been no fundamental changes in the business model since the acquisition date to the extent rates do not improve in the longterm or the new administration does not reverse the immigration restrictions the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate the claims amounts ultimately settled will most likely be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of 

table of contents 

illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims that have been received or adjudicated as of the end of a reporting period relative to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs for that same period when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows  these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2020 data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 80 million for the year ended december 31 2020 excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

table of contents 

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a shorttail which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2020 will be known by the end of 2021 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately 86 million 49 million and 25 million of the incurred related to prior years was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of population health management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that population health management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis these initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the population health management initiative are not known by us additionally certain population health management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the population health management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of population health management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

• appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions other inpatient hospital admissions and observation admissions in accordance with interqual or other criteria 

• management of our preauthorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles 

• emergency department program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer nonemergency care away from the costly emergency department setting through patient education onsite alternative urgent care settings etc 

table of contents 

• increased emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patients specific healthcare needs 

• incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive multidisciplinary collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma 

• prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our start smart for your baby outreach service 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans premiums received from our members and cms for our medicare product and premiums from members of our commercial health plans in addition to member premium payments our marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from cms we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of its membership generally the risk score is determined by the state or cms analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances including commercial plans our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or cms which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or cms for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the healthcare providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

for qualifying low income pdp members cms pays for some or all of the members monthly premium we receive certain part d prospective subsidy payments from cms for our pdp members as a fixed monthly per member amount based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year as reflected in our bids approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy a settlement payment is made between cms and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services for performancebased measures in our contracts revenue is recognized as data sufficient to measure performance is available we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract for the dods tricare program on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the tricare contract includes various performancebased measures for each of the measures an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date and revenue is recognized accordingly

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif the aca imposed the hif in 2014 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 the hif was suspended in 2017 and 2019 beginning in 2021 the hif was permanently repealed if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the grossup to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif are not passthrough payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

some states require state directed payments that have minimal risk but are administered as a premium adjustment these payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100 hbr we have little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by the state

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a leading multinational healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives we take a local approach  with local brands and local teams  to provide fully integrated highquality and costeffective services to governmentsponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our population health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol cnc 

we operate in two segments managed care and specialty services our managed care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized and commercial programs our specialty services segment includes companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to our managed care segment and other external customers for the year ended december 31 2019  our managed care and specialty services segments accounted for 95 and 5  respectively of our total external revenues our membership totaled 152 million as of december 31 2019  for the year ended december 31 2019  our total revenues and net earnings attributable to centene were 746 billion and 13 billion  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 15 billion  

wellcare acquisition 

on january 23 2020  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of wellcare health plans inc wellcare and such acquisition the wellcare acquisition  the transaction is valued at approximately 196 billion  including the assumption of 195 billion of outstanding debt the cash portion of the acquisition was funded through the issuance of longterm debt in december 2019 the wellcare acquisition brings a highquality medicare platform and further extends our robust medicaid offerings the wellcare acquisition also enables us to provide access to more comprehensive and differentiated solutions across more markets with a continued focus on affordable highquality culturallysensitive healthcare services with the wellcare acquisition  we further broadened our product offerings by adding a medicare prescription drug plan to our existing business lines the business discussion reflects only centene operations in 2019 prior to the completion of the wellcare acquisition  unless specifically noted 

industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid commercial and medicare products we currently have operations domestically and internationally 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 

under the affordable care act aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government paid the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 95 of the costs in 2017 94 of the costs in 2018 93 of the costs in 2019 and 90 of the costs in 2020 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in subsequent years the federal share is scheduled to remain at 90 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act aged blind or disabled or collectively abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their health status 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created the state childrens health insurance program chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

longterm services and supports ltss is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltss services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state medicaid ltss benefits the largest groups receiving ltss by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance and other populations states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltss beneficiaries according to the national association of states united for aging and disabilities 24 states utilize some form of managed ltss up from eight in 2004 

the majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for medicaid most commonly through title ive of the social security act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes the federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state medicaid in addition the aca requires states to make former foster care children eligible for medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in medicaid at that time 

cms estimated the total medicaid market to be approximately 595 billion in 2018 and estimated the market will grow to 10 trillion by 2027 medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 22 in 2018 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 55 between 2018 and 2027 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments which is typically more expensive as a result many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe managed care has improved the quality of care for medicaid beneficiaries and lowered costs the majority of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid populations 

commercial 

established in 2010 and operational in 2014 the aca created health insurance marketplaces which are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes generally between 100400 of the federal poverty level with some exceptions to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

w e also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups we offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers coverage typically is subject to deductibles and copayments or coinsurance 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups the medicare program provides health care coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older as well as to individuals with certain disabilities 

we provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act 

a portion of medicare beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 109 million dualeligible enrollees in 2018 these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our aged blind and disabled abd long term services and supports ltss medicaremedicaid plans mmp and medicare advantage dual special needs plan dsnp lines of business 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star ratings calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 

cms estimated the total medicare market was approximately 747 billion in 2018 and estimated the market will grow to approximately 14 trillion by 2027 medicare spending is estimated to have increased 59 in fiscal 2018 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 74 between 2018 and 2027

we currently have a growing international presence in spain the united kingdom uk and slovakia in june 2019 we purchased an additional 40 ownership in ribera salud for 54 million bringing our total ownership to 90 ribera salud manages health administration concessions in various regions in spain in the uk our subsidiary operose health group limited operose health is one of the largest provider networks and delivers medical and community based services in the primary care sector of the national health service nhs which is the publicly funded national healthcare system for england we also have additional noncontrolling investments in the uk our equity method investee in slovakia provides radiology services in the region 

our competitive strengths 

our approach is based on the following key competitive strengths 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managed care 

benefits to customers 

we feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer and program to program our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



we also provide a comprehensive set of education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members to access quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques these awards include case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery cost management and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 

 

 

 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract services are provided on a feeforservice basis 

we often start our provider relationships in a payforperformance arrangement before we transition to a risksharing arrangement which is based on the total cost of care as we advance along this continuum it strengthens our partnerships with our providers enabling the delivery of high quality care 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and population health management programs our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and population health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the population health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as care management software dental benefits management homebased primary care services life and population health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management 

our population health programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we have received ncqa health plan accreditation in 23 of 25 eligible states and are pursing accreditation in the remaining two states 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality 

for the 2019 star rating calculated in 2018 for the quality bonus payment in 2020 our california and health net oregon contracts received 40 out of 50 stars the texas dsnp florida dsnp wisconsin dsnp and arizona dsnp contracts were measured at 35 stars and our arizona hmo and oregon trillium contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2019 star rating we carry a 40 star parent organization rating approximately 86 of our medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2020 bonus year 

for the 2020 star rating calculated in 2019 for the quality bonus payment in 2021 our texas dsnp and wisconsin dsnp contracts received a 45 out of 50 stars and our california contracts received 40 stars the oregon new york and arkansas contracts measured at 35 stars and our arizona florida texas hmo south carolina and georgia contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2020 star rating we carry a 35 star parent organization rating approximately 46 of our medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2021 bonus year 

we remain committed to our quality initiatives and expect to return to a 40 star parent rating in the future the parent organization star rating is used for new medicare contracts while existing contracts follow their individual star ratings to determine bonus payments

three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines the cms chapter guidance and the compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by these authorities these key components are 

 

the goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically to measure the values and engagement of the organization our corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for our board of directors audit committee chairman to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud waste abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore our board of directors has established a corporate compliance committee that among other things reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes including business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level this includes but is not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    



 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state county federal and commercial contracts in addition the impact of the aca and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product we believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates population health management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve   

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at local state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction states have implemented national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting states have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of hmos and insurance companies we are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators 

regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels for example the current administration and certain members of congress have indicated that they may continue to pursue significant amendments to the aca even if the aca is not amended or repealed the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca in december 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the acas individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid ie that it was not severable from the aca that decision was appealed to the fifth circuit which ruled in december 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability the aca remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the current administration remains uncertain 

the aca transformed the us healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business for a further discussion of the implementation of the aca as well as the potential repeal of or changes to the aca see risk factors  the implementation of health reform legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows below 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions for example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid program our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

we must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment to ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state we also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities 

we provide medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans dsnps and medicaremedicaid plans mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program the dod military and family life counseling program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years the contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 20 states under federallyfacilitated and statebased marketplace contracts with cms that expire annually 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act the general data protection regulation gdpr in the european union eu and state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys generals in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified on october 1 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we must maintain compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at medicare medicaid health insurance marketplace and commercial products the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud waste and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company unless the context otherwise requires the terms the company we us our or similar terms and centene refer to us after giving effect to the wellcare acquisition  

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging approximately 60 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with federal and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state governments to terminate contracts with them in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed and our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 sequestration subject to a 2 cap which was extended by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 for an additional two years through 2027 in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of one or more contracts for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if another federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs for example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions or penalties if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance for example our parent star rating for the 2020 rating year is 35 which may negatively affect quality bonus payments for medicare advantage plans in 2021 the lowered star rating for the 2020 rating year may have reduced the attractiveness of the affected plans and our other offerings to members reduce revenue from the affected plans and impact our medicare expansion efforts which are a strategic focus for the company 

there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

although we do not anticipate that a singlepayer national health insurance system will be enacted by the current congress several legislative initiatives have been proposed by members of congress and presidential candidates that would establish some form of a single public or quasipublic agency that organizes healthcare financing but under which healthcare delivery would remain private if enacted such a system could adversely affect our business 

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expenses exceed our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent viruses such as the coronavirus new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits also member behavior could continue to be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding changes to the aca including the removal of the penalty associated with the acas individual mandate in 2019 

our medical expenses include claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the aca as well as potential repeal of changes to or judicial challenges to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the enactment of the aca in march 2010 transformed the us healthcare delivery system through a series of complex initiatives however the implementation of the aca continues to face judicial challenges as well as challenges from the current administration to repeal or change certain of its significant provisions changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the aca as well as judicial interpretations in response to legal and other constitutional challenges could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows even if the aca is not amended or repealed the current administration could continue to propose changes impacting implementation of the aca which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations 

among the most significant of the acas provisions was the establishment of the health insurance marketplace for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage that included a minimum level of benefits and restrictions on coverage limitations and premium rates as well as the expansion of medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the hhs additionally indicated that it would consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion arkansas was the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning on january 1 2014 several states have obtained section 1115 waivers to implement the acas medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law with additional states pursuing section 1115 waivers regarding eligibility criteria benefits and costsharing and provider payments across their medicaid programs litigation challenging section 1115 waiver activity for both new and previously approved waivers is expected to continue both through administrative actions and the courts 

there have been significant efforts by the current administration to repeal or limit implementation of certain provisions of the aca through changes in regulations such initiatives include repeal of the individual mandate effective in 2019 as well as easing the regulatory restrictions placed on shortterm health plans and association health plans ahps which plans often provide fewer benefits than the traditional aca insurance benefits 

additionally the us department of labor issued a final rule on june 19 2018 which expanded flexibility regarding the regulation and formation of ahps provided by small employer groups and associations on june 13 2019 the hhs the us department of labor and the us treasury issued a final rule allowing employers of all sizes that do not offer a group coverage plan to fund a new kind of health reimbursement arrangement hra known as an individual coverage hra ichra beginning january 1 2020 employees are able to use employerfunded ichras to buy individualmarket insurance including insurance purchased on the public exchanges formed under the aca 

in addition to efforts by the current administration to expand the flexibility of other insurance plan options that are not required to meet aca requirements there have also been efforts to address the acas nondeductible tax imposed on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the aca imposed hif was 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter the hif payable in 2017 was suspended by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2016 however a 143 billion payment occurred in 2018 collection of the hif for 2019 was also suspended but resumed in 2020 with an anticipated 155 billion payment congress passed a spending bill in december 2019 which would repeal the health insurance tax indefinitely effective in 2021 there is continuing litigation pending against the federal government regarding the requirement to reimburse medicaid managed care organizations for the health insurer fee if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the hif including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address the current assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the constitutionality of the aca itself continues to face judicial challenge in december 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the acas individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid ie that it was not severable from the aca that decision was appealed to the fifth circuit which ruled in december 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after congress set the individual mandate penalty to 0 and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability the aca remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the current administration or the outcome of the lawsuit cannot be predicted 

these changes and other potential changes involving the functioning of the health insurance marketplace as a result of new legislation regulation or executive action could impact our business and results of operations 

any failure to adequately price products offered or reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

any failure to adequately price products offered or reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow among other things due to the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax cuts and jobs act tcja we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether in addition the risk adjustment provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product are subject to a high degree of estimation and variability and are affected by our members acuity relative to the membership acuity of other insurers further changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured or require us to increase premium rates any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state or federal level in the united states or internationally may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premiums back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement factors that may impact the amount of premium returned to the state include transparent pharmacy pricing and rebate initiatives other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards there are numerous steps regulators require for continued implementation of the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of potentially more onerous federal regulations if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected for example under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan 

in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others cms subsequently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on november 8 2018 advancing cms efforts to streamline the medicaid and chip managed care regulatory framework and to pursue a broader strategy to relieve regulatory burdens support state flexibility and local leadership and promote transparency flexibility and innovation in the delivery of care public comments were submitted in january 2019 however a final rule has yet to be issued although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa any failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product these businesses are subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures and regulators regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the structuring of rebates and pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with government entities expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality star ratings or required changes to the way we do business in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent thirdparty vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plans enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements either new programs to determine eligibility or new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or when it chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand into new geographies and complementary business lines as well as to augment existing operations and we may be in discussions with respect to one or multiple targets at any given time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to further expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and diversify our business in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by third parties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if one or any combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations in addition to state corporate law limitations these subsidiaries are subject to more stringent state insurance and hmo laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a significant portion of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for a significant portion of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors in addition the administration of the aca has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example our wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company hnl is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnls payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our managements attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management team or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists in addition we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 the grammleachbliley act and the eus gdpr which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud waste and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hhs office for civil rights received 287 million from enforcement actions in 2018 surpassing the previous record of 235 million from 2016 by 22 percent it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase the amount or application of penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with all other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of fraud waste and abuse investigations from time to time the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services many states have false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback statute in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam relators private parties acting on the governments behalf federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of prevention and detection controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of significant acquisitions 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected or if any financing related to the acquisitions is on unfavorable terms the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our existing business with acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions 

the success of acquisitions we make will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the existing business of centene with such acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combinations if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of acquired businesses with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the integration may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows our ability to successfully manage the expanded business following any given acquisition will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations as a result of acquisitions or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2019  we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately 13726 million  excluding the notes issued in the exchange offer described below and we may further increase our indebtedness in the future in connection with the wellcare acquisition we completed an exchange offer for 525 senior notes due 2025 and 5375 senior notes due 2026 collectively the wellcare notes issued by wellcare and issued 1146 million aggregate principal amount of 525 senior notes due 2025 and 747 million aggregate principal amount of 5375 senior notes due 2026 additionally our whollyowned subsidiary wellington merger sub ii inc assumed the remaining wellcare notes this increased indebtedness and any resulting higher debttoequity ratio will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility and term loan facility collectively the company credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make certain investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our company credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum debttoebitda ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the company credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or our results of operations or financial condition 

as of december 31 2019  we held 21 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference rate and borrowings under our company credit facility bear interest based upon various reference rates including libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate sofr the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain as a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock 

we may from time to time issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions we often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board of directors may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock 

the wellcare acquisition may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

although we currently anticipate that the wellcare acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share on an adjusted earnings basis that is not pursuant to gaap during the second year after the consummation of the wellcare acquisition  this expectation is based on assumptions about our and wellcares business and preliminary estimates which may change materially certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the wellcare acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the wellcare acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition we could encounter additional transactionrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the wellcare acquisition  including cost and revenue synergies all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the wellcare acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with wellcare and realize the anticipated benefits of the wellcare acquisition 

the success of the wellcare acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of centene and wellcare and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of its common stock may be harmed 

the wellcare acquisition involves the integration of wellcares business with our existing business which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we have not previously completed an acquisition comparable in size or scope to the wellcare acquisition the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 



 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of the wellcare acquisition  

our ability to successfully manage this expanded business following the completion of the wellcare acquisition will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent standalone companies but also the increased scale and scope of our business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the wellcare acquisition  

we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to integration of our business with wellcare 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of our business with wellcare there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits in addition our and wellcares businesses will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and tampa florida respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the wellcare acquisition including financing of the wellcare acquisition  facilities and systems consolidation costs we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to attract motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisition fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs additionally as a result of the wellcare acquisition  rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the companys credit ratings which may increase the our financing costs including in connection with the financing of the wellcare acquisition  

the financing arrangements that the we entered into in connection with the wellcare acquisition may under certain circumstances contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact the our ability to operate its business 

we incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with the wellcare acquisition  the agreements governing the indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the wellcare acquisition contain covenants that among other things may under certain circumstances place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to 

 in addition we are required to maintain a minimum amount of excess availability as set forth in these agreements 

our ability to maintain minimum excess availability in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control the ability to comply with this covenant in future periods will also depend on our ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize the anticipated benefits of the wellcare acquisition  including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing

executive overview 

general 

we are a leading multinational healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives we take a local approach  with local brands and local teams  to provide fully integrated highquality and costeffective services to governmentsponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and selling general and administrative sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the health benefits ratio hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed

year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

total revenues 

the following table sets forth supplemental revenue information for the year ended december 31   in millions 



total revenues increased 24 in the year ended december 31 2019  over the corresponding period in 2018  primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 and 2019 particularly arkansas illinois iowa new mexico and pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019 total revenues also increased due to atrisk state directed and pass through payments of approximately 825 million from the state of california and pass through payments of approximately 531 million from the state of new york during the twelve months ended december 31 2019  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 2 composite change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2019 was 873  an increase of 140 basis points over the comparable period in 2018  the hbr increase was primarily attributable to the health insurance marketplace business where margins have normalized as expected from the favorable performance in 2018 and the health insurer fee moratorium also the 2018 hbr benefited from the recognition of the ihss program reconciliation 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 79 million in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  the cost of service increase is primarily attributable to the operations of newly acquired businesses partially offset by the veterans affairs contract expiration effective october 2018 

the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2019 was 843  compared to 850 in 2018  the decrease in the cost of service ratio was primarily due to the veterans affairs contract expiration 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 490 million in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  the sga increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fidelis care expansions new programs and growth in many of our states in 2019 including growth in the health insurance marketplace business partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs 

the sga expense ratio was 93 for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 107 for the year ended december 31 2018  the yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to 336 million of lower acquisition related expenses the adjusted sga expense ratio was 92 for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 100 for the year ended december 31 2018  both ratios decreased due to the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a lower sga expense ratio the veterans affairs contract expiration in 2018 and lower variable compensation costs in 2019 

health insurer fee expense 

as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2019 calendar year we did not record hif expense for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 709 million for the year ended december 31 2018  

goodwill and intangible impairment 

in 2019 we recorded 271 million or 057 per diluted share of noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment substantially all of the impairment is associated with our usmm physician home health business and was identified as part of our third quarter review procedures which included an analysis of new information related to our shared savings demonstration programs slower than expected penetration of the physician home health business model into our medicaid population and the related impact to revised forecasts the business continues to generate positive cash flows and plays an important role in care management however it has fallen short of our overall performance expectations 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



investment and other income investment and other income increased by 190 million for year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the increase in investment income in 2019 reflects higher investment balances over 2018 including the proceeds of our 70 billion senior note issuance related to the planned financing for the cash consideration for the wellcare acquisition and the impact of higher investment balances as a result of the fidelis care acquisition  the increase also reflects higher interest rates the ribera salud acquisition gain of 16 million and improved performance associated with our deferred compensation investment portfolio which fluctuates with its underlying investments the earnings from our deferred compensation portfolio were substantially offset by increases in deferred compensation expense recorded in sga expense 

debt extinguishment costs in october 2019 we redeemed the outstanding principal balance on the 1400 million 5625 senior notes due february 15 2021 plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date we recognized a pretax loss on extinguishment of 30 million on the redemption of the 1400 million 5625 senior notes including the call premium the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loss on the termination of the 600 million interest rate swap agreement associated with the notes 

interest expense interest expense increased by  69 million in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  the increase is driven by a net increase in borrowings related to the issuance of an additional 70 billion in senior notes in december 2019 intended primarily to finance the cash consideration of the wellcare acquisition  and increased borrowings in may 2018 related to the financing of the fidelis care acquisition 

the net impact of the 70 billion senior notes issued in preparation of the wellcare acquisition was approximately 13 million 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2019  we recorded income tax expense of 473 million on pretax earnings of 18 billion  or an effective tax rate of 265  which reflects the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium partially offset by the nondeductibility of a portion of our noncash goodwill and intangible impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2019 for the year ended december 31 2018  we recorded income tax expense of 474 million on pretax earnings of 14 billion  or an effective tax rate of 346  which reflects the impact of the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

total revenues increased 25 in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 and 2019 particularly arkansas illinois iowa new mexico and pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019 total revenues also increased due to atrisk state directed and pass through payments of approximately 825 million from the state of california and pass through payments of approximately 531 million from the state of new york earnings from operations increased 496 million between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care and lower acquisition related expenses partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019 

specialty services 

total revenues increased 10 in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and acquisitions partially offset by the previously mentioned veterans affairs contract expiration earnings from operations decreased 173 million between years primarily due to the previously discussed noncash goodwill and intangible impairment and our transition to transparent pharmacy pricing partially offset by higher costs recognized in 2018 associated with our veterans affairs contract expiration the transparent pricing decrease was offset by higher earnings in our managed care segment and reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding intangible assets medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include but are not limited to member attrition rates contract renewal probabilities revenue growth rates expectations of profitability and discount and royalty rates we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2019  we had 6863 million of goodwill and 2063 million of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership financial performance state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update asu simplifying the test for goodwill impairment during the third quarter of 2019 we adopted the new guidance the amendments in the asu eliminated step 2 from the quantitative goodwill impairment test while still allowing management to first perform the qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative assessment is necessary if the quantitative assessment is required the impairment test under the new asu is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the impairment charge under the new asu is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors during the third quarter of 2019 we recorded 271 million of noncash goodwill  259 million  and intangible asset  12 million  impairment substantially all associated with our us medical management usmm physician home health business in the specialty services segment the impairment was identified as part of our quarterly review procedures which included an analysis of new information related to its shared savings demonstration programs slower than expected penetration of the physician home health business model into its medicaid population and the related impact to revised forecasts we utilized the income approach in the analysis which derives the fair value of the intangible assets and goodwill based on the present value of discounted expected cash flows 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate the claims amounts ultimately settled will most likely be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims that have been received or adjudicated as of the end of a reporting period relative to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs for that same period when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows  these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2019 data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 55 million for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a shorttail which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2019 will be known by the end of 2020  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately  49 million   25 million and  1 million of the incurred related to prior years was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of population health management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that population health management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis these initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the population health management initiative are not known by us additionally certain population health management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the population health management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of population health management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans premiums received from our members and cms for our medicare product and premiums from members of our commercial health plans in addition to member premium payments our marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from cms we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of its membership generally the risk score is determined by the state or cms analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances including commercial plans our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or cms which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or cms for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the healthcare providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services for performancebased measures in our contracts revenue is recognized as data sufficient to measure performance is available we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract for the dods tricare program on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the tricare contract includes various performancebased measures for each of the measures an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date and revenue is recognized accordingly 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif the aca imposed the hif in 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 and is imposing the hif in 2020 the hif was suspended in 2017 and 2019 if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the grossup to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif are not passthrough payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

some states require state directed payments that have minimal risk but are administered as a premium adjustment these payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100 hbr we have little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by the state 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2019  we had shortterm investments of 863 million and longterm investments of 8375 million  including restricted deposits of 658 million  the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and private equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2019  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 262 million  declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 2100 million with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 2100 million of our longterm debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2019  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 69 million  an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors – our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

inflation 

  

historically the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the overall inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable health care reform regulations an increase in the expected rate of inflation for healthcare costs or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid commercial and medicare products we currently have operations domestically and internationally 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act aged blind or disabled or collectively abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their health status 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created the state childrens health insurance program chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance 

costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

longterm services and supports ltss is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltss services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state medicaid ltss benefits the largest groups receiving ltss by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance and other populations states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltss beneficiaries according to the national association of states united for aging and disabilities 21 states utilize some form of managed ltss up from eight in 2004 

the majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for medicaid most commonly through title ive of the social security act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes the federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state medicaid in addition the aca requires states to make former foster care children eligible for medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in medicaid at that time 

cms estimated the total medicaid market to be approximately 582 billion in 2017 and estimated the market will grow to 10 trillion by 2026 medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 29 in 2017 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 58 between 2017 and 2026 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments which is typically more expensive as a result many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe managed care has been proven to improve the quality of care for medicaid beneficiaries and lower costs the majority of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid populations 

commercial 

w e offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through the health insurance marketplace and large and small employer groups our health maintenance organization hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans he or she selects a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network our preferred provider organization ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any healthcare provider with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider coverage typically is subject to deductibles and copayments or coinsurance our point of service pos plans and our elect open access eoa plans blend the characteristics of hmo ppo and indemnity plans members can have comprehensive hmostyle benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower copayments particularly within the medical group but also have coverage generally at higher copayment or coinsurance levels or with coverage limitations for services received outside the network our exclusive provider organization epo plans and healthcare service plans hsps similarly blend elements of traditional hmo and ppo plans 

in 2010 the aca was enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision medicaid expansion the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government paid the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 95 of the costs in 2017 and 94 of the costs in 2018 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in 2019 the federal share is scheduled to decline to 93 and it would be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and cost sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups we provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act 

a portion of medicare beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 107 million dualeligible enrollees in 2017 these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltss medicaremedicaid plans mmp and medicare advantage dual special needs plan lines of business 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star ratings calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally

our competitive strengths 

our approach is based on the following key competitive strengths 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managed care 

benefits to customers 

we feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer and program to program our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



we also provide a comprehensive set of education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members to access quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques these awards include case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 

 

 

 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract services are provided on a feeforservice basis 

we often start our provider relationships with a payforperformance arrangement before we transition to a risk sharing arrangement where we share total cost as we advance along this continuum it strengthens our partnerships with our providers enabling the delivery of high quality care 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as care management software dental benefits management homebased primary care services life and health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management and quality improvement teams 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we have received ncqa health plan accreditation in 21 of 23 eligible states and are pursing accreditation in the remaining two states 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality for the 2019 star rating calculated in 2018 for the quality bonus payment in 2020 our california contracts oregon hmo and oregon ppo contracts received 40 out of 50 stars the texas dsnp florida dsnp wisconsin dsnp and arizona dsnp contracts were measured at 35 stars and our arizona hmo and oregon trillium hmo contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2019 star rating we carry a 40 star parent organization rating 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare strategy and complement our core managed care business our provision of specialty services diversifies our revenue stream enhances the quality of health outcomes for our members and others and allows centene to manage costs our envolve brand brings together our extensive portfolio of specialty healthcare solutions envolve leverages our collective expertise in pharmacy solutions health triage wellness and disease management vision and dental services and management services to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare for members and other organizations our specialty services are provided primarily as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we currently have ncqa accreditation and urac accreditation for several of our specialty companies 

corporate compliance 

our ethics and compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote prevention and detection of fraud waste and abuse and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law and private payor healthcare program requirements as well as our own ethics and business policies responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa as they pertain to us and our business units from a compliance business and technical perspective 

three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines the cms chapter guidance and the compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by these authorities these key components are 

 

the goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically to measure the values and engagement of the organization our corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for our board of directors audit committee chairman to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud waste abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore our board of directors has established a corporate compliance committee that among other things reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes including business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level this is including but not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state county federal and commercial contracts in addition the impact of the aca and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product we believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at local state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction states have implemented national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting states have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of hmos and insurance companies we are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators 

regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal or national levels for example the current administration and certain members of congress have indicated that they may continue to pursue significant amendments to the aca even if the aca is not amended or repealed the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca the ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the current administration that would affect the aca remains uncertain most recently a december 2018 partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america held that the aca’s individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid this ruling is being appealed and the aca remains in effect until the appeal is concluded the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the current administration remains uncertain 

the aca transformed the us healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business for a further discussion of the implementation of the aca as well as the potential repeal of or changes to the aca see “risk factors  the implementation of health reform legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows” below 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions for example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid program our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

we must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment to ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state we also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities 

we provide medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans dsnps and medicaremedicaid plans mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program the department of defense military and family life counseling program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years the contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 20 states under federallyfacilitated and statebased marketplace contracts with cms that expire annually this includes marketplace contracts that commenced in 2019 in pennsylvania north carolina south carolina and tennessee 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys generals in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified on october 1 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we must maintain compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at medicare medicaid health insurance marketplace and commercial products the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud waste and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 47300  employees we believe our relationships with our employees are positive

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare chip ltss abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging around 59 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with us and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state governments to terminate contracts with it in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed and our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltss abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 “sequestration” subject to a 2 cap which was extended by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 for an additional two years through 2027 in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltss abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs for example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions or penalties if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance for example our parent star rating for the 2018 rating year was 35 which will negatively affect quality bonus payments for medicare advantage plans in 2019 these lowered star ratings for the 2018 rating year for the medicare advantage plan h0562 and the company may have reduced the attractiveness of the affected plans and our other offerings to members reduce revenue from the affected plan and impact our medicare expansion efforts which are a strategic focus for the company 

there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

our business could be adversely affected by the singlepayer national health insurance system currently contemplated by members of congress the expanded and improved medicare for all act would establish a single public or quasipublic agency that organizes healthcare financing but healthcare delivery would remain private 

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows   

our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expenses exceed our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent viruses new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits also member behavior could continue to be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding changes to the aca including the repeal of the acas individual mandate in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja 

our medical expenses include claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the aca as well as potential repeal of or changes to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the aca was enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could elect to opt out of the medicaid expansion portion of aca without losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government paid the entire cost for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share began to decline and will end at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years as of december 31 2018  36 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility and additional states continue to discuss expansion the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage the aca also required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed repealing the individual mandate requirement of the aca beginning in 2019 on august 1 2018 the us hhs issued a final rule permitting the duration of shortterm health insurance plans to be extended up to 36 months in total the final rule which went into effect on october 2 2018 is currently being challenged at the state level and in pending litigation against the current administration additionally the us department of labor issued a final rule on june 19 2018 which expanded flexibility regarding the regulation and formation of association health plans ahps provided by small employer groups and associations this final rule allows more employer groups and associations to form ahps based upon common geography and industry sector in july 2018 twelve states attorneys general filed suit against the current administration in the us district court in washington dc to block the final rule the lawsuit is currently ongoing shortterm health insurance plans and ahps often provide fewer benefits than the traditional aca insurance benefits these changes and other potential changes involving the functioning of the health insurance marketplaces as a result of new legislation regulation or executive action could impact our business and results of operations 

any failure to adequately price products offered or reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow among other things due to the repeal of the individual mandate in the tcja we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether in addition the risk adjustment provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured or require us to increase premium rates any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the health insurance marketplaces arkansas was the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 as of december 31 2018  eight states had approved section 1115 waivers to implement the acas medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law 

the aca imposed an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter the health insurer fee payable in 2017 was suspended by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2016 however the 143 billion payment resumed in 2018 collection of the health insurer fee for 2019 has also been suspended such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes the fee is allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenues notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenues from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenues from the fee calculation there are ongoing challenges pending against the federal government regarding the requirement to reimburse medicaid managed care organizations for the industry assessment if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps regulators require for continued implementation of the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of potentially more onerous federal regulations for example in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

on march 23 2018 congress further bolstered the current administration’s position to end costsharing subsidies by omitting cost sharing subsidy payments from the twoyear omnibus spending bill this bill coupled with the current administration’s decision to end payments could affect our earnings and potential premium rate adjustments in 2019 

changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the aca as well as judicial interpretations in response to legal and other constitutional challenges could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows even if the aca is not amended or repealed the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations most recently a december 2018 partial summary judgment ruling in texas v united states of america  held that the aca’s individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid this ruling is being appealed and the aca remains in effect until the appeal is concluded the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the current administration or the outcome of the lawsuit cannot be predicted 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement factors that may impact the amount of premium returned to the state include transparent pharmacy pricing initiatives other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan additionally cms issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on november 8 2018 advancing cms’ efforts to streamline the medicaid and chip managed care regulatory framework and a broader strategy to relieve regulatory burdens support state flexibility and local leadership and promote transparency flexibility and innovation in the delivery of care with public comments due by january 9 2019 although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product these businesses are subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with the government expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality star ratings or require changes to the way we do business in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent thirdparty vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand into new geographies and complementary business lines as well as to augment existing operations and may be in discussions with respect to one or multiple targets at any given time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by third parties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ requests to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors in addition the administration of the aca has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example our wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company hnl is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnl’s payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management team or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 the grammleachbliley act and the general data protection regulation gdpr which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules hhs continued its auditing program in 2016 to assess compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates through a second phase of audits which commenced for covered entities in july 2016 hhs focused on a review of policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules the hhs office for civil rights reported that as of february 2018 the phase 2 desk audits of covered entities and business associates were completed and additional comprehensive onsite audits would be conducted as a part of a permanent audit program going forward an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with all other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of fraud and abuse investigations from time to time the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare va and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services many states have false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback statute in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam  relators federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of significant acquisitions 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with the assets acquired in the fidelis care acquisition and realize the anticipated benefits of the fidelis care acquisition 

we completed the fidelis care acquisition on july 1 2018 the success of the fidelis care acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the company and fidelis care and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combinations if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of fidelis cares business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the integration may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations as a result of the fidelis care acquisition 

as a result of the fidelis care acquisition the size of our business is significantly larger our ability to successfully manage the expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations as a result of the fidelis care acquisition or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2018  we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately 6686 million  we may further increase our indebtedness in the future this increased indebtedness and any resulting higher debttoequity ratio will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our notes require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or our results of operations or financial condition 

as of december 31 2018 we held 27 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference rate and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest based upon various reference rates including libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain as a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

we incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the fidelis care acquisition and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of our business with fidelis care 

we incurred substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the fidelis care acquisition and expect to incur substantial expense related to the integration of our business with the acquired assets of fidelis care there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits in addition our businesses and fidelis care will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and new york new york respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the fidelis care acquisition including the financing of the fidelis care acquisition and facilities and systems consolidation costs we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs these incremental transaction and acquisition related costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs 

future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock 

we may from time to time issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions we often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board of directors may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock

executive overview 

general 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and selling general and administrative sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the health benefits ratio hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed 

on december 12 2018  the board of directors declared a twoforone split of our common stock in the form of a 100 stock dividend distributed on february 6 2019 to stockholders of record as of december 24 2018  all share per share and stock price information presented in this form 10k has been adjusted for the twoforone stock split 

fidelis care acquisition 

on july 1 2018 we acquired substantially all of the assets of new york state catholic health plan inc dba fidelis care new york fidelis care for approximately   36 billion   of cash consideration   which includes a working capital adjustment  the cash consideration was funded through approximately 28 billion  of new equity and approximately 18 billion  of new longterm debt both offerings were completed in may 2018 the fidelis care acquisition expanded our health plan footprint to new york state as a result of the completion of the fidelis care acquisition our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018  include the results of operations of fidelis care from july 1 2018 to december 31 2018  due to the size of the acquisition one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to the fidelis care acquisition 

as part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the fidelis care acquisition we entered into certain undertakings with the new york state department of health these undertakings contain various commitments by us effective upon completion of the fidelis care acquisition one of the undertakings includes a 340 million  contribution by us to the state of new york to be paid over a fiveyear period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within new york state the present value of the 340 million  contribution to the state of new york approximately 328 million  was expensed during 2018 

  

acquisitions and investments 

we continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions and investments during 2018 in the first quarter of 2018 w e acquired community medical holdings corp dba community medical group cmg   an atrisk primary care provider serving medicaid medicare advantage and health insurance marketplace patients in miamidade county florida  cmg has a multipayor strategy and serves members of our florida health plan the acquisition increases our scale and capabilities and creates a vertical integration opportunity with providers in the first quarter of 2018 we also acquired an additional 61  ownership in interpreta holdings inc interpreta a clinical and genomics data analytics business  bringing our total ownership to 80  in the first and second quarters of 2018 we completed a 28  equity method investment in rxadvance rxa a fullservice pharmacy benefit manager pbm with an innovative technology platform in the third quarter of 2018 we made an additional investment in rxa in the form of convertible preferred stock both the interpreta and rxa transactions reflect our commitment to technological innovation and providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services 

in the second quarter of 2018 we acquired mhm services inc mhm a provider of behavioral health medical and dental services to correctional facilities state hospitals courts juvenile facilities and community clinics under the terms of the agreement we also acquired the remaining 49  ownership of centurion the correctional healthcare services joint venture between mhm and us expanding our national footprint in the correctional healthcare sector 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 our spanish subsidiary primero salud acquired 89 of torrejón salud the concessionaire of the university hospital of torrejón de ardoz in the community of madrid expanding our presence in spain 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

in december 2018 a federal district judge in texas ruled that the entire affordable care act aca is unconstitutional in the case of “texas v united states of america” the case centers on the argument that the laws individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca and without it the remainder of the aca was invalid the company remains focused on the promise of delivering access to quality affordable healthcare to all of its members following the district court decision regarding the constitutionality of the aca the aca will remain in its current form for 2019 we believe the aca will remain in its current form or in modified form that ensures the continuation of coverage for existing members beyond 2019 

we have more than three decades of experience spanning six presidents from both sides of the aisle in delivering highquality healthcare services on behalf of states and the federal government to uninsured families commercial organizations and military families we continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members customers and shareholders

membership 

from december 31 2016  to december 31 2018  we increased our managed care membership by 26 million  or 23  the following table sets forth our membership by line of business 



the following table sets forth additional membership statistics which are included in the membership information above 



from december 31 2017  to december 31 2018  our membership increased as a result of 

 

these increases were partially offset by a net decrease in our behavioral health membership as many states are combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for each of the three years ended december 31 2018  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  in millions except per share data in dollars 



nm not meaningful 

year ended december 31   2018  compared to year ended december 31   2017   

total revenues 

the following table sets forth supplemental revenue information for the year ended december 31   in millions 



total revenues increased 24  in the year ended december 31 2018  over the corresponding period in 2017  primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business expansions and new programs in many of our states and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 this was partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the removal of the ihss program from californias medicaid contract in january 2018  during the twelve  months ended december 31 2018  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1 composite change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2018  was 859  a decrease  of 140  basis points over the comparable period in 2017  the hbr decrease compared to last year was driven by membership growth in the health insurance marketplace business the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 and the recognition of the previously mentioned ihss program reconciliation  this was partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a higher hbr  

cost of services 

cost of services increased  by 539 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  this was primarily due to the acquisition of foundation care in october 2017 and growth in our correctional services business including the acquisition of mhm 

the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2018  was 850  compared to 815  in 2017  the cost of service ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points for the costs associated with the veterans affairs contract expiration the increase in the cost of service ratio was also due to lower margins associated with our other federal services business and growth in our specialty pharmacy business due to the acquisition of foundation care in october 2017 which operates at a higher cost of service ratio these increases were partially offset by growth in our correctional services business resulting from the acquisition of mhm which operates at a lower cost of service ratio 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 16 billion  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  this was primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care including acquisition related expenses costs associated with the previously mentioned veterans affairs contract expiration and expansions new programs and growth in many of our states in 2018 including growth in the health insurance marketplace business these increases were partially offset by the 56 million recognized during 2017 for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of penn treaty 

the sga expense ratio was 107  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 97  for the year ended december 31 2017  the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses  the adjusted sga expense ratio was 100  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 95  for the year ended december 31 2017  the sga and adjusted sga expense ratios both increased due to growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the impact of the removal of the ihss program from californias medicaid contract in january 2018  these increases in both ratios were  partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care   

health insurer fee expense 

health insurance fee expense was  709 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31 2017  

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2018  reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2017  including the impact of higher investment balances as a result of organic portfolio growth and the fidelis care acquisition these increases were partially offset by 2017 interest income from the state of illinois related to capitation payment delays interest expense increased  by  88 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  reflecting a net increase in borrowings primarily related to the financing of the fidelis care acquisition and the effect of our interest rate swaps 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2018  we recorded income tax expense of 474 million  on pretax earnings of 14 billion  or an effective tax rate of 346  the effective tax rate reflects the lower corporate tax rate as enacted in the tcja partially offset by an increased tax rate due to the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded income tax expense of 326 million  on pretax earnings of 11 billion  or an effective tax rate of 287  which reflects the higher corporate tax rate for 2017 the onetime effects of the tcja and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

total revenues increased   25  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care and expansions new programs and growth in many of our states particularly florida georgia illinois missouri pennsylvania and texas including growth in the health insurance marketplace business total revenues also increased as a result of the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 these increases were partially offset by the impact of the removal of the ihss program from californias medicaid contract in january 2018 and a reduction in pass through payments from the state of california in 2018 compared to 2017 earnings from operations increased   393 million  between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 partially offset by increased acquisition related expenses in addition 2017 was negatively impacted by the penn treaty assessment expense 

specialty services 

total revenues increased   4  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue for our behavioral health services business as a result of many states combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members earnings from operations decreased   134 million  between years primarily due to costs associated with the previously mentioned veterans affairs contract expiration and lower margins in our other federal services and behavioral health services businesses partially offset by growth in our pharmacy benefits management business 

beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we expect lower earnings in our specialty services segment and corresponding higher earnings in our managed care segment as we move to transparent pharmacy pricing this reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment it also aligns with our continued transition to the next generation rxadvance pharmacy platform during 2019 and 2020 

year ended december 31   2017  compared to year ended december 31   2016   

total revenues 



total revenues increased 19  in the year ended december 31 2017  over the corresponding period in 2016  primarily as a result of a full year of health nets results as well as the impact of growth in the health insurance marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017 this was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017 lower membership in the commercial business in california as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016 and lower specialty pharmacy revenues as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017 compared to 531 million  recognized in 2016 during the year ended december 31 2017  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1 composite rate change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2017  was 873  an increase of 80  basis points over the comparable period in 2016  the increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the 195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california which reduced the 2016 hbr by 50 basis points a premium rate reduction for california medicaid expansion effective july 1 2017 an increase in flu related costs over 2016 and the impact of new or expanded health plans which initially operate at a higher hbr these increases were partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business which operates at a lower hbr 

cost of services 

cost of services decreased by 17 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  this was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business partially offset by growth in our correctional business the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2017  was 815  compared to 855  in 2016  the decrease  in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our homebased primary care business 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 773 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  this was primarily a result of 

 

the increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of 214 million 

the sga expense ratio was 97  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 98  for the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease in the sga expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016 the penn treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the health net business which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business 

the adjusted sga expense ratio was 95  for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 90  for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in the adjusted sga expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business 

health insurer fee expense 

as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 461 million recognized for the year ended december 31 2016  

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2017  reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016  as well as interest income from the state of illinois related to capitation payment delays interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2017  by 38 million due to an increase in net borrowings primarily related to the issuance of an additional 24 billion in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded income tax expense of 326 million  on pretax earnings of 11 billion  or an effective tax rate of 287  the effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded lower income tax expense of 125 million  related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded income tax expense of 599 million  on pretax earnings of 12 billion  or an effective tax rate of 516  which reflects the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of health net 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



in january 2017 we reclassified cenpatico behavioral health of arizona llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment due to a reorganization of the arizona management structure following the health net integration as a result the financial results of cenpatico behavioral health of arizona llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan have been reclassified from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment for all periods presented   

managed care 

total revenues increased 19  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  primarily as a result of a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results and growth expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly arkansas florida georgia indiana louisiana missouri nebraska ohio and texas partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium earnings from operations decreased  163 million between years primarily as a result of the 195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017 and new or expanded health plans which initially operate at a higher hbr and incur startup costs these drivers were partially offset by 214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the health insurance marketplace business 

specialty services 

total revenues increased 44  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  resulting primarily from the a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results the continued integration of health net into our specialty services increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our correctional services and homebased primary care businesses earnings from operations increased 99 million  between years primarily due to a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2018  were 12 billion  or 14  times net earnings compared to 15 billion  in 2017  the cash provided by operations in 2018  was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities primarily resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business  cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables  of  12 billion  due to growth in the business   additionally cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the repayment of approximately 10 billion of medicaid expansion rate overpayments and medicaid expansion mlr rebates in california which was previously accrued   

cash flows from operating activities for 2017  was  15 billion  compared to  19 billion  in 2016  cash provided by operations in 2017  was primarily due to net earnings an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the commencement of the nebraska and nevada health plans cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was 19 billion cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables additionally cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately 445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date 

  

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period

during 2019  we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 327 million associated with our growth and spend approximately 650 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions these amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our revolving credit facility and construction loan however from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes either through issuance of debt or equity the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate in addition we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities andor improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes revolving credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows  in millions 

  



1 our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  includes 1259 million  of other longterm liabilities this consists primarily of longterm deferred income taxes liabilities under our deferred compensation plan liabilities related to certain undertakings reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing andor amount of any cash payment is uncertain 

commitments 

as part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the fidelis care acquisition we entered into certain undertakings with the new york state department of health these undertakings contain various commitments by us that were effective upon completion of the fidelis care acquisition one of the undertakings includes a   340 million  contribution by us to the state of new york to be paid over a fiveyear period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within new york state the present value of the contribution to the state of new york approximately 328 million was expensed during 2018 

in addition in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the health net acquisition from the california department of insurance and th e california department of managed health care in 2016 we committed to certain undertakings the california undertakings the california undertakings included among other items operational commitments around premiums dividend restrictions minimum risk based capital rbc levels local offices growth accreditation hedis scores and other quality measures network adequacy certifications investments and capital expenditures specifically we agreed to among other things 



 the california undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2018  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 7259 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 3279 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  we contributed 154 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners naic we estimate our rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

under the california knoxkeene health care service plan act of 1975 as amended “knoxkeene” certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity tne requirements under these knoxkeene tne requirements actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures excluding capitated amounts in addition certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking 

under the new york state department of health codes rules and regulations title 10 part 98 our new york subsidiary must comply with contingent reserve requirements under these requirements net worth based upon admitted assets must equal or exceed a minimum amount based on annual net premium income 

the naic has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2018  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies such restrictions unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus statutory income and unassigned surplus as of december 31 2018  the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was 3279 million in the aggregate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding intangible assets medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include but are not limited to member attrition rates contract renewal probabilities revenue growth rates expectations of profitability discount and royalty rates we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2018  we had 7015 million  of goodwill and 2239 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors the goodwill of 267 million associated with our home health business is expected to be recovered however the penetration of this business model into our medicaid population has been slower than anticipated the associated decreased profitability has been offset by the performance of our shared savings demonstration programs to the extent the demonstration programs change substantially in advance of the medicaid penetration the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows ” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2018  data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 45 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2018  will be known by the end of 2019  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately  25 million   1 million  and  39 million  of the “incurred related to prior years” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans premiums received from our members and cms for our medicare product and premiums from members of our commercial health plans in addition to member premium payments our marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from cms we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of its membership generally the risk score is determined by the state or cms analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances including commercial plans our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or cms which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or cms for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the healthcare providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the tricare contract includes various performancebased measures for each of the measures an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date and revenue is recognized accordingly 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif the aca imposed the hif in 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 the hif was suspended in 2017 and 2019 if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the “grossup” to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for certain products premium taxes state assessments and the hif are not passthrough payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2018  we had shortterm investments of 722 million  and longterm investments of 7416 million  including restricted deposits of 555 million  the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and private equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2018  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 241 million  declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 2700 million  with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 2700 million  of our longterm debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2018  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 102 million  an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors – our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

historically the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the overall inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations an increase in the expected rate of inflation for healthcare costs or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

in september 2017 we signed a definitive agreement under which fidelis care will become our health plan in new york state under the terms of the agreement we will acquire substantially all of the assets of fidelis care for 375 billion  subject to certain adjustments 

we operate in two segments managed care and specialty services our managed care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized and commercial programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program chip longterm services and supports ltss medicare foster care supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled or collectively abd and medicaremedicaid plans mmp which cover beneficiaries who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid in addition our commercial operations which include our members through the health insurance marketplace are included within the managed care segment our specialty services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups military service members and their families and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2017  our managed care and specialty services segments accounted for 95  and 5  respectively of our total external revenues 

our membership totaled 122 million  as of december 31 2017  for the year ended december 31 2017  our total revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to centene were 484 billion  and 828 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 15 billion  

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid which includes chip ltss foster care abd and mmp medicare and commercial products we currently have operations domestically and internationally 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their health status 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

ltss is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltss services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state medicaid ltss benefits the largest group receiving ltss by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities 98 billion in 2015 followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities 44 billion in 2015 those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance 9 billion in 2015 and other populations 7 billion in 2015 states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltss beneficiaries according to the national association of states united for aging and disabilities 20 states utilize some form of ltss up from eight in 2004 

the majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for medicaid most commonly through title ive of the social security act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes the federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state medicaid in addition the affordable care act requires states to make former foster care children eligible for medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in medicaid at that time 

cms estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 566 billion in 2016 and estimated the market will grow to 929 billion by 2025 medicaid spending increased by 39 in 2016 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 57 between 2017 and 2025 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe recognition of the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs will continue to strengthen a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltss foster care and abd populations 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups we provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act 

a portion of medicare beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 107 million dualeligible enrollees in 2017  these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltss mmp and medicare advantage dual special needs plan lines of business 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star ratings calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 

cms estimated the total medicare market was approximately 679 billion in 2016 and estimate the market will grow to approximately 13 trillion by 2025 medicare spending increased 51 in fiscal 2016 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 73 between 2017 and 2025 

commercial 

w e offer commercial healthcare products to individuals and large and small employer groups as well as products to individuals through the health insurance marketplace our health maintenance organization hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans he or she selects a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network our preferred provider organization ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any healthcare provider with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider coverage typically is subject to deductibles and copayments or coinsurance our point of service pos plans and our elect open access eoa plans blend the characteristics of hmo ppo and indemnity plans members can have comprehensive hmostyle benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower copayments particularly within the medical group but also have coverage generally at higher copayment or coinsurance levels or with coverage limitations for services received outside the network our exclusive provider organization epo plans and healthcare service plans hsps similarly blend elements of traditional hmo and ppo plans 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision medicaid expansion the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government paid the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 and 95 of the costs in 2017 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in 2018 the federal share is scheduled to decline to 94 in 2019 it would be 93 and it would be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and cost sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis

  our business strategy 

key components of our current business strategy include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of our longlived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our managed care subsidiaries in california and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2017  in addition the federal government is a significant customer to our specialty services segment due to our federal services business 

managed care 

benefits to customers 

we feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer and program to program our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



we also provide a comprehensive set of education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members to access quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques these awards include case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 

 

 

 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract services are provided on a feeforservice basis we also maintain a provider network in support of vas patient centered community care pc3 program 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management care management software dental benefits management homebased primary care services life and health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare dental diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management and quality improvement teams 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have ncqa health plan accreditation in 19 of 22 eligible states 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality for the 2018 star rating calculated in 2017 for the quality bonus payment in 2019 our california dsnp oregon hmo oregon ppo and arizona dsnp contracts received 40 out of 50 stars the california hmo ohio texas and wisconsin dsnps and oregon trillium hmo contracts were measured at 35 stars and our arizona hmo and florida dsnp contracts received 30 stars in addition for the 2018 star rating we carry a 35 star parent organization rating we are currently appealing the 2018 star rating 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare strategy and complement our core managed care business our provision of specialty services diversifies our revenue stream enhances the quality of health outcomes for our members and others and allows centene to manage costs our envolve brand brings together our extensive portfolio of specialty healthcare solutions envolve leverages our collective expertise in pharmacy solutions health triage wellness and disease management and vision and dental services to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare for members our specialty services are provided primarily as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we currently have ncqa accreditation and urac accreditation for several of our specialty companies 

corporate compliance 

our ethics and compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote prevention and detection of fraud waste and abuse and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law and private payor healthcare program requirements as well as our own ethics and business policies responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa as they pertain to us and our business units from a compliance business and technical perspective 

three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines the cms chapter guidance and the compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

the goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically to measure the values and engagement of the organization our corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for our board of directors audit committee chairman to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud waste abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore the board of directors has established a corporate compliance committee that among other things reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes resulting from the aca business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state federal and commercial contracts in addition the impact of the aca and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish adequate provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product we believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at local state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction states have implemented national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting states have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of hmos and insurance companies we are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators 

regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal or national levels for example the current administration and certain members of congress have indicated that they may continue to pursue significant amendments to the aca even if the aca is not amended or repealed the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca the ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the current administration that would affect the aca remains uncertain 

the aca transformed the us healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business for a further discussion of the implementation of the aca as well as the potential repeal of or changes to the aca see the risk factor below entitled “the implementation of health reform legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows” 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan pharmacy or provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions for example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid program our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at both the state and federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

we must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment to ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state we also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities 

we provide medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans dsnps and medicaremedicaid plans mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program the department of defense military and family life counseling program the us department of veterans affairs patient centered community care program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years the contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 15 states under federallyfacilitated and statebased marketplace contracts with cms that expire annually in 2018 we began operating under marketplace contracts in kansas missouri and nevada we expect to begin operating under a marketplace contract in new york pending the closing of the fidelis care transaction 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works we also operate under a contract with the new hampshire department of health and human services to participate in the medicaid expansion model that new hampshire has adopted referred to as the “premium assistance program” 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys generals in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified on october 1 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we must maintain compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at medicare medicaid health insurance marketplace and commercial products the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company unless the context otherwise requires the terms the “company” “we” “us” “our” or similar terms and “centene” i prior to the closing of the proposed fidelis acquisition refer to centene corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries without giving effect to the proposed fidelis acquisition and ii upon and after the closing of the proposed fidelis acquisition refer to us after giving effect to the proposed fidelis acquisition 

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltss abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging around 57 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with us and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state government to terminate contracts with it in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed and our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltss abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 “sequestration” subject to a 2 cap in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltss abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs for example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions or penalties if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance as previously announced cms recently published medicare star ratings for the 2018 rating year the achievement of star ratings of four or higher for the 2018 rating year qualifies medicare advantage plans for quality bonus payments in 2019 the results from cms indicate that health net of california incs medicare advantage plan h0562 will move to a 35 star rating from a 40 star rating for the 2018 rating year the effect of this star rating change will lower our parent star rating for the 2018 rating year from 40 stars to 35 stars and therefore our plans that use the parent rating as well as the medicare advantage plan h0562 will not be eligible for the quality bonus payments in 2019 these lowered star ratings for the 2018 rating year for the medicare advantage plan h0562 and the company may reduce the attractiveness of the affected plans and our other offerings to members reduce revenue from the affected plan and impact our medicare expansion efforts which are a strategic focus for the company we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the lowered ratings on our revenues and expansion efforts in 2019 there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows   

our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent viruses new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in addition the 2018 marketplace for individual products may continue to be less stable than in previous years because among other things other health plans have changed or stopped offering their health insurance marketplace products in the states we expect to serve in 2018 or have announced plans to change their health insurance marketplace product offerings in 2018 also member behavior could be influenced by the repeal of the acas individual mandate in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja and further uncertainty surrounding other potential changes to the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as affordable care act aca 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the aca as well as potential repeal of or changes to the aca could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the aca was enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could elect to opt out of the medicaid expansion portion of aca without losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government pays the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline ending at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years as of december 31 2017 32 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility and additional states continue to discuss expansion the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage the aca also required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed repealing the individual mandate requirement of the aca beginning in 2019 this change and other potential changes involving the functioning of the health insurance marketplaces as a result of new legislation regulation or executive action could impact our business and results of operations 

any failure to adequately price products offered or reduction in products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow among other things due to the repeal of the individual mandate in the tcja we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three rs provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further the three rs may not be adequately funded moreover changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured require us to increase premium rates or result in funding issues under the three rs these potential exits and other continued volatility in this market may be further exacerbated by the conclusion of the risk corridor and reinsurance programs as of january 1 2017 our continued success in the exchanges is dependent on our ability to successfully respond to these changes in the market over time any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us department of health and human services hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the health insurance marketplaces arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 as of december 31 2017 seven states had approved section 1115 waivers to implement the acas medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law 

the aca imposed an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter the health insurer fee payable in 2017 was suspended by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2016 however the 143 billion payment resumes in 2018 for the fiscal year 2017 such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes the fee is allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenues notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenues from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenues from the fee calculation if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps regulators required for continued implementation of the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations for example in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

in addition house v hargan previously v burwell et al and v price et al  the suit that was brought by house republicans was settled in december 2017 the new administrations decision to stop the cost sharing subsidies rendered further challenge to the cost sharing subsidy payments unnecessary while 2018 premium rates for health insurance marketplace were set without factoring in the cost sharing subsidy payments from the federal government the new administrations decision to end payments could affect our earnings 

changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the aca could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows even if the aca is not amended or repealed the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations however the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration cannot be predicted 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product these businesses are subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with the government expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality star ratings or require changes to the way we do business in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors in addition the administration of the aca has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example our wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company “hnl” is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnl’s payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 and the grammleachbliley act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules additionally hhs continued its auditing program in 2016 to assess compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates through a second phase of audits which commenced for covered entities in july 2016 hhs focused on a review of policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with all other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of fraud and abuse investigations from time to time the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare va and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services many states have false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback statute in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam  relators federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of significant acquisitions 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with health net and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

we completed the acquisition of health net on march 24 2016 the success of the acquisition of health net will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the company and health net and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of health net’s business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the acquisition of health net the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the acquisition of health net and are incurring substantial expenses related to the integration of health net 

we are in the process of integrating a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems including sales pricing and marketing among other things in addition the businesses of centene and health net will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and woodland hills california respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the acquisition including financing of the acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we are also incurring transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs these incremental transaction and acquisition related costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of our acquisition of health net 

the size of our business following the acquisition of health net is significantly larger than the size of either our or health net’s respective businesses prior to the acquisition our ability to successfully manage the expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity we will also have to manage our expanded operations in compliance with certain undertakings with regulators that were agreed to in connection with the approval of the acquisition these undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future operations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2017  we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately 4699 million  we may further increase our indebtedness in the future this increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the proposed fidelis acquisition may not occur and if it does it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

although we currently anticipate that the proposed fidelis acquisition will occur and will be accretive to earnings per share on an adjusted earnings basis that is not pursuant to gaap from and after the proposed fidelis acquisition this expectation is based on assumptions about our and fidelis care’s business and preliminary estimates which may change materially as a result should the proposed fidelis acquisition occur certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed fidelis acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock the proposed fidelis acquisition may not occur as a result in addition we could also encounter additional transactionrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the proposed fidelis acquisition including cost and revenue synergies all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed fidelis acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 

the proposed fidelis acquisition is subject to conditions some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis if at all failure to complete the proposed fidelis acquisition could have material adverse effects on our business 

the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition is subject to a number of conditions including among others the receipt of certain regulatory approvals which make the completion and timing of the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition uncertain also either we or fidelis care may terminate the asset purchase agreement if the proposed fidelis acquisition has not been consummated by july 1 2018 or september 1 2018 if the extension is exercised except that this right to terminate the asset purchase agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the asset purchase agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the proposed fidelis acquisition to be consummated on or before that date 

if the proposed fidelis acquisition is not completed our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits that we could have realized had the proposed fidelis acquisition been completed we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if the proposed fidelis acquisition is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed fidelis acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the asset purchase agreement if any such risk materializes it could adversely impact our ongoing business 

similarly delays in the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the proposed fidelis acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe we cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the proposed fidelis acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed fidelis acquisition will be consummated 

centene and fidelis care are each subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed acquisition is pending which could adversely affect the business and operations of us or the combined company

uncertainties associated with the proposed fidelis acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company 

we and fidelis care are each dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans the combined company’s success after the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition will depend in part upon the ability of each of us and fidelis care to retain key management personnel and other key employees prior to completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition current and prospective employees of each of us and fidelis care may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of us and fidelis care to attract or retain key management and other key personnel in addition no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of each of us and fidelis care to the same extent that we and fidelis care have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees 

completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which fidelis care is a party which may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations 

the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which fidelis care is a party if we are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions with fidelis care the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages even if we are able to negotiate waivers with fidelis care the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to fidelis care or the combined company any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations

the success of the proposed fidelis acquisition will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to successfully combine our business and the assets acquired in the proposed fidelis acquisition and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination if the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of its common stock may be harmed additionally rating agencies may take negative actions against the combined company 

the proposed fidelis acquisition involves the integration of certain assets of fidelis care with our existing business which is expected to be a complex costly and timeconsuming process the integration may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect the combined company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the integration of fidelis care with our business may result in unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized these integration matters could have an adverse effect on i each of us and fidelis care during this transition period and ii the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition in addition any actual cost savings of the proposed fidelis acquisition could be less than anticipated 

the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition 

following the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of our business the combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity the combined company may not be successful or may not realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the proposed fidelis acquisition 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition and the integration of our business with fidelis care 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the proposed fidelis acquisition and the integration of our business with substantially all of the assets of fidelis care there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits in addition our businesses and fidelis care will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and new york new york respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the proposed fidelis acquisition including financing of the proposed fidelis acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs the combined company may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs additionally as a result of the proposed fidelis acquisition rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the combined company’s credit ratings which may increase the combined company’s costs in connection with the financing of the proposed fidelis acquisition these incremental transaction and acquisition related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs 

we will incur additional indebtedness to finance the proposed fidelis acquisition 

in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition we expect to incur approximately 16 billion  in additional indebtedness assuming we do not use the option to fund up to 500 million of the acquisition consideration in our common stock and assuming we issue approximately 23 billion of new equity the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately 63 billion which is greater than our current indebtedness prior to the proposed fidelis acquisition the increased indebtedness of the combined company in comparison to ours on a historical basis could adversely affect us in a number of ways including 

 

the financing arrangements that the combined company will enter into in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition may under certain circumstances contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact the combined company’s ability to operate its business 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition we expect that the agreements governing the indebtedness incurred in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition will contain covenants that among other things may under certain circumstances place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to 



 in addition the combined company will be required to maintain a minimum amount of excess availability as set forth in these agreements 

the combined company’s ability to maintain minimum excess availability in future periods will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond the combined company’s control the ability to comply with this covenant in future periods will also depend on the combined company’s ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize contemplated synergies 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond the combined company’s control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants contained in its debt agreements failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing such indebtedness under these circumstances the combined company might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the combined company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing 

we have obtained commitment letters for the senior unsecured budge loan facility however neither the definitive loan documents nor the terms of any debt financing in lieu of such bridge financing have been finalized 

future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock including shares issued in connection with the proposed fidelis acquisition could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock 

subject to market conditions we intend to fund the purchase price for the proposed fidelis acquisition with 23 billion of new equity including shares paid as consideration any such issuances and sales of our preferred or common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock further any sale of shares to finance a portion of the purchase price for the proposed fidelis acquisition will be subject to market conditions and could be negatively impacted by a decline in the market price for our common stock in addition in the future we may issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions we often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock

general 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and selling general and administrative sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the health benefits ratio hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

in october 2017 the president signed an executive order allowing trade associations and other groups to establish health plans exempt from certain aca requirements which may be sold across state lines also in october 2017 the trump administration announced that the federal government would stop funding cost sharing reduction csr subsidies additionally a deal was subsequently reached by bipartisan senators to restore csr payments for two years in exchange for more aca state flexibility there are no guarantees the deal will reach the senate floor for vote the lack of csr payments from the federal government for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in expense of  008  per diluted share included in our 2017 earnings the limited impact is the result of payments received through september 30 2017 in our various states being nearly sufficient to cover our full year csr expectations for 2018 all of our states have approved premium rates that assumed no csr funding despite the removal of the csrs individuals below 400 of the federal poverty level our target market will still have access to subsidies through the advance premium tax credit aptc we continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members customers and shareholders 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act income tax reform was signed into law by the president the modified tax code includes a lower corporate tax rate and changes to certain credits and deductions including the limitations to the deductibility of interest expense the enactment of income tax reform resulted in a benefit of 071  per diluted share to our 2017 earnings related to the adjustment of the income tax rate on our net deferred tax liabilities in addition the income tax reform bill repealed the individual mandate requirement of the aca beginning in 2019

our financial performance for 2017  is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on march 24 2016 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of health net a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and governmentsponsored managed care plans due to the size of this acquisition one of the primary drivers of the yearoveryear variances discussed throughout this section is related to the acquisition of health net

we expect the following items to contribute to our revenue or future growth potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the future growth items listed above are partially offset by the following items 

 

 

in october 2017 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published updated medicare star quality ratings for the 2018 ratings year the 2018 ratings year will affect quality bonus payments for medicare advantage plans in 2019 the results indicate that one of health net of california incs medicare advantage plans h0562 will move to a 35 star rating from a 40 star rating for the 2018 ratings year the effect of this star rating change would lower our parent star rating for the 2018 ratings year from 40 stars to 35 stars the reduction in the star rating for health net california is the result of a 2015 program audit health net californias underlying rating reflects 40 star performance however cms lowered a single measure bapp – beneficiary access and performance problem because of a penalty associated with a plan audit in 2015 which caused a decline in the overall score to 35 stars while overall quality measures improved on a yearoveryear basis such improvement was insufficient to compensate for the lower bapp measure the penalty related to the 2015 program audit will only impact the 2018 ratings year and will not have a continuing impact on the star ratings in future rating years we are currently appealing our commitment to quality remains as strong as ever we are working to evaluate and mitigate the potential impact on our revenues in 2019 as a result of the lowered 2018 rating and working to implement yearoveryear quality improvements we believe we will return to a 40 star parent rating in future periods

nm not meaningful 

year ended december 31   2017  compared to year ended december 31   2016 

total revenues 

total revenues increased 19  in the year ended december 31 2017  over the corresponding period in 2016  primarily as a result of a full year of health nets results as well as the impact of growth in the health insurance marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017 this was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017 lower membership in the commercial business in california as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016 and lower specialty pharmacy revenues  as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017 compared to 531 million  recognized in 2016 during the year ended december 31 2017  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1 composite change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2017  was 873  an increase  of 80  basis points over the comparable period in 2016  the increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the 195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california which reduced the 2016 hbr by 50 basis points a premium rate reduction for california medicaid expansion effective july 1 2017 an increase in flu related costs over 2016 and the impact of new or expanded health plans which initially operate at a higher hbr these increases were partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business which operates at a lower hbr 

cost of services 

cost of services decreased  by 17 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  this was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business partially offset by growth in our correctional business the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2017  was 815  compared to 855  in 2016  the decrease  in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our homebased primary care business 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 770 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  this was primarily a result of 

 

the increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of 214 million 

the sga expense ratio was 97  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 98  for the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease in the sga expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016 the penn treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the health net business which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business   

the adjusted sga expense ratio was 95  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 90  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in the adjusted sga expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business  

health insurer fee expense 

as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 461 million recognized for the year ended december 31 2016  

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016 as well as interest income from the state of illinois related to capitation payment delays interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2017  by 38 million due to an increase in net borrowings primarily related to the issuance of an additional 24 billion in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded income tax expense of 326 million  on pretax earnings of 11 billion  or an effective tax rate of 287  the effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded lower income tax expense of 125 million  related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded income tax expense of 599 million  on pretax earnings of 12 billion  or an effective tax rate of 518  which reflects the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of health net 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



in january 2017 we reclassified cenpatico behavioral health of arizona llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment due to a reorganization of the arizona management structure following the health net integration as a result the financial results of cenpatico behavioral health of arizona llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan have been reclassified from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment for all periods presented   

managed care 

total revenues increased   19  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  primarily as a result of a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results and growth expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly arkansas florida georgia indiana louisiana missouri nebraska ohio and texas partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium  earnings from operations decreased   160 million  between years primarily as a result of the 195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017 and new or expanded health plans which initially operate at a higher hbr and incur startup costs these drivers were partially offset by 214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the health insurance marketplace business 

specialty services 

total revenues increased   44  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  resulting primarily from the a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results the continued integration of health net into our specialty services increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our correctional services and homebased primary care businesses  earnings from operations increased   99 million  between years primarily due to a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results   

year ended december 31   2016  compared to year ended december 31   2015   

total revenues 

total revenues increased 78  in the year ended december 31 2016  over the corresponding period in 2015  primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the impact from expansions acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015 during the year ended december 31 2016  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1 composite rate change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2016  was 865  a decrease of 240  basis points over the comparable period in 2015  the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to the acquisition of health net membership growth in medicaid expansion and health insurance marketplace products and improvement in hbr in the higher acuity populations also in the fourth quarter we recognized additional revenue relating to the retroactive contract amendment that changed the minimum mlr calculation under californias medicaid expansion program which reduced our 2016 hbr by 50 basis points 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 243 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the corresponding period in 2015  this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net and growth in our correctional business partially offset by lower pharmacy costs to external customers the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2016  was 855  compared to 864  in 2015  the decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of health net which operates at a lower cost of service ratio 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 19 billion  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the corresponding period in 2015  this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net acquisition related expenses restructuring and integration costs and the impact from expansions acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015 during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded approximately 234 million of health net acquisition related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 098  during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded approximately 27 million  of health net acquisition related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 014  we also recorded expense of 50 million  in 2016 for contribution commitments to our charitable foundation 

the sga expense ratio was 98  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 85  for the year ended december 31 2015 the adjusted sga expense ratio was 90  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 83  for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in the sga expense ratio is primarily attributable to the addition of the health net business which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a higher mix of commercial and medicare business 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2016  reflects an increase in investment balances over 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of health net interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2016  by 174 million primarily reflecting the issuance of an additional 2400 million in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction interest expense also increased due to the issuance of an additional 500 million  in senior notes in june 2016 the assumption of health nets 400 million in senior notes and the issuance of the 1200 million  in senior notes in november 2016 these increases were partially offset by the redemption of the centene 425 million   575  senior notes and the health net 400 million   6375  senior notes in november 2016 and december 2016 respectively in addition we incurred 11 million associated with the early redemption of the centene 575  senior notes due 2017 and the health net 6375  senior notes due 2017 which was recorded in interest expense 

income tax expense 

for the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded income tax expense of 599 million  on pretax earnings of 12 billion  or an effective tax rate of 518  for the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded income tax expense of 339 million  on pretax earnings of 697 million  or an effective tax rate of 486  the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee expense limitations on the deductibility of compensation and the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of health net 

segment results 

as previously discussed cenpatico behavioral health of arizona llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan were reclassified to the managed care segment in january 2017 the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions and reflects the above change 



managed care 

total revenues increased 83  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net and expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly california florida georgia indiana louisiana mississippi oregon texas and washington earnings from operations increased 546 million between years primarily reflecting the acquisition of health net and product and geographical expansions in many of our states 

specialty services 

total revenues increased 24  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  resulting primarily from the acquisition of health net growth in our behavioral health and correctional services businesses and increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment earnings from operations increased 9 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily due to an increase in earnings related to our pharmacy benefits management and correctional services businesses and the health net acquisition partially offset by lower earnings in our specialty pharmacy and homebased primary care businesses as well as increased utilization in several specialty services businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2017  were 15 billion  or 18  times net earnings compared to 19 billion  in 2016  the cash provided by operations in 2017  was primarily due to net earnings an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the commencement of the nebraska and nevada health plans   

cash flows from operating activities for 2016  was 19 billion  compared to 658 million  in 2015  cash provided by operations in 2016  was primarily due to net earnings an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables additionally cash provided by operations in 2016  was increased by approximately 445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date the cash provided by operations in 2015  was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business partially offset by increases in premium and trade receivables 

  

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period 



cash flows used in investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  24 billion  in 2016  and 813 million  in 2015  cash flows used in investing activities in 2017  primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to longterm investments and capital expenditures

during the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  we received dividends of 312 million  121 million  and 11 million  respectively from our regulated subsidiaries 

2018  expectations 

in the second quarter of 2018 we expect to complete the proposed fidelis acquisition for approximately 375 billion  in connection with the upcoming closing of the acquisition we expect to issue approximately 23 billion of new equity and approximately 16 billion of new debt the proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the proposed fidelis acquisition 

during 2018 we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 325 million associated with our growth and spend approximately 706 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions these amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our revolving credit facility however from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes either through issuance of debt or equity the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate also we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities andor improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes revolving credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows  in millions 

  



1 our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  includes 952 million  of other longterm liabilities this consists primarily of longterm deferred income taxes liabilities under our deferred compensation plan reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing andor amount of any cash payment is uncertain 

commitments 

in addition in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the health net acquisition from the california department of insurance and th e california department of managed health care we committed to certain undertakings the undertakings the undertakings included among other items operational commitments around premiums dividend restrictions minimum risk based capital rbc levels local offices growth accreditation hedis scores and other quality measures network adequacy certifications investments and capital expenditures specifically we agreed to among other things 



 the undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2017  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 5153 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 2251 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  we contributed 26 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners naic we estimate our rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

under the california knoxkeene health care service plan act of 1975 as amended “knoxkeene” certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity tne requirements under these knoxkeene tne requirements actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures excluding capitated amounts in addition certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking 

the naic has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2017  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies such restrictions unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus statutory income and unassigned surplus as of december 31 2017  the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was 2251 million in the aggregate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding intangible assets medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2017  we had 4749 million  of goodwill and 1398 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows ” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2017  data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 31 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2017  will be known by the end of 2018  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately 1 million  39 million  and 47 million  of the “incurred related to prior years” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  



 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of its membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states medicaid membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the healthcare providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the tricare contract includes various performancebased incentives and penalties for each of the incentives or penalties we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that it has earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the “grossup” to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2017  we had shortterm investments of 531 million  and longterm investments of 5447 million  including restricted deposits of 135 million  the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts assetbacked securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2017  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 187 million  declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 2700 million  with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 2700 million  of our longterm debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2017  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 123 million  an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors – our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the overall inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations an increase in the expected rate of inflation for healthcare costs or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

on march 24 2016 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of health net inc health net a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and governmentsponsored managed care plans the transaction was valued at approximately 5990 million  including the assumption of 703 million  of outstanding debt the acquisition allows us to offer a more comprehensive and scalable portfolio of solutions and provides opportunity for additional growth across the combined companys markets 

we operate in two segments managed care and specialty services our managed care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid that also encompasses the state childrens health insurance program chip long term care ltc foster care dualeligible individuals duals the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program abd medicare and health insurance marketplace the managed care segment also includes the operations previously included in health nets western region operations segment with the exception of certain operations of its pharmaceutical services and behavioral health subsidiaries the portions of health nets western region operations segment included in the managed care segment consist of the following health net operations commercial medicare medicaid and dual eligible health plans primarily in arizona california oregon and washington our specialty services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries the specialty services segment also includes the operations previously included in the government contracts segment of health net as well as certain operations of its pharmaceutical services and behavioral health subsidiaries the latter of which health net previously included in its western region operations segment the government contracts business includes our governmentsponsored managed care support contract with the us department of defense dod under the tricare program in the north region the military family and life counseling mflc contract with the dod and other health care related government contracts including the patient centered community care pc3 with the us department of veterans affairs va for the year ended december 31 2016  our managed care and specialty services segments accounted for 92  and 8  respectively of our total external revenues 

our managed care membership totaled 114 million  as of december 31 2016  for the year ended december 31 2016  our total revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to centene were 406 billion  and 559 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 1851 million  

our subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan kentucky spirit ceased serving members in kentucky as of july 6 2013 accordingly the results of operations for kentucky spirit are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis with the exception of cash flow information is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

industry 

we provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through medicaid which includes chip ltc foster care duals and abd medicare health insurance marketplace tricare and other state and federal programs including programs for the uninsured we also offer a variety of individual small group and large group commercial health care products both to employers and directly to members 

medicaid 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act of 1935 as amended abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

cms estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 545 billion in 2015 and estimate the market will grow to 973 billion by 2025 medicaid spending increased by 97 in 2015 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 59 between 2016 and 2025 

ltc is a medicaid product that covers institutionalresidential care nursing facilities intermediate care facilities and home and community based services hcbs for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring the most common hcbs services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems ltc services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or who are entitled to state medicaid ltc benefits the largest group receiving ltc by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities 93 billion in 2014 followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities 42 billion in 2014 those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance 9 billion in 2014 and other populations 8 billion in 2014 states are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their ltc beneficiaries according to the national association of states united for aging and disabilities 22 states utilize some form of ltc up from eight in 2004 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe recognition of the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs will continue to strengthen a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd populations 

medicare 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups we provide or arrange health care benefits for services normally covered by medicare plus a broad range of health care benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member any benefits that are not covered by medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits according to cms regulations and guidance many of our medicare advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits 

we provide a wide range of medicare products including medicare advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice medicare coverage our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act of 1935 as amended 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately 104 million dualeligible enrollees in 2016  these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care hcbs andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltc medicaremedicaid plan mmp and medicare advantage dual special needs plan lines of business 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality the star ratings are used by cms to award quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans beginning with the 2014 star rating calculated in 2013 medicare advantage plans were required to achieve a minimum of 40 stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment in 2016 the methodology and measures included in the star ratings system can be modified by cms annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 

cms estimated the total medicare market was approximately 646 billion in 2015 and estimate the market will grow to 13 trillion by 2025 medicare spending increased 45 in fiscal 2015 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 71 between 2016 and 2025 

commercial 

w e offer commercial health care products to individuals and large and small employer groups as well as products to individuals through the health insurance marketplace our health maintenance organization hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans he or she selects a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network our preferred provider organization ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider coverage typically is subject to deductibles and copayments or coinsurance our point of service pos plans and our elect open access eoa plans blend the characteristics of hmo ppo and indemnity plans members can have comprehensive hmostyle benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower copayments particularly within the medical group but also have coverage generally at higher copayment or coinsurance levels or with coverage limitations for services received outside the network our exclusive provider organization epo plans and healthcare service plans hsps similarly blend elements of traditional hmo and ppo plans 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision medicaid expansion the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in 2017 the federal share is scheduled to decline to 95 in 2018 it would be 94 in 2019 it would be 93 and it would be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and costsharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

our competitive strengths 

our approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

for the year ended december 31 2016  total revenues of 406 billion  produced a five year compound annual growth rate cagr of 51 

 

 

 

 

 

  our business strategy 

key components of our current business strategy include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

  



      

substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the companys long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in california and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2016  in addition the federal government is a significant customer to our specialty services segment due to our federal services business 

managed care 

benefits to customers 

we feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer and program to program our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

 



we also provide a comprehensive set of education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members to access quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques including case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



providers 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product timeline eg medicaid or medicare we pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements or risksharing performancebased arrangements 

 

 

 

in addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our t3 contract for the tricare north region services are provided on a feeforservice basis we also maintain a provider network in regions 1 2 and 4 in support of vas pc3 program 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management care management software dental benefits management inhome health services life and health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare dental diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa 

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have 19 of 26 eligible health plans with ncqa accreditation 

cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality for the 2017 star rating calculated in 2016 for the quality bonus payment in 2018 our oregon hmo contract received 45 out of 50 stars the arizona bridgeway california hmo california ppo texas superior and wisconsin mhs contracts were measured at 40 stars our oregon ppo contract was measured at 35 stars and our arizona hmo ohio buckeye and oregon trillium contracts received 30 stars in addition we carry a 4 star parent organization rating 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare strategy and complement our core managed care business our provision of specialty services diversifies our revenue stream enhances the quality of health outcomes for our members and others and allows centene to manage costs in 2015 we launched envolve a new brand that brings together our extensive portfolio of specialty healthcare solutions envolve leverages our collective expertise in pharmacy solutions health triage wellness and disease management and vision and dental services to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare for members our specialty services are provided primarily as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we currently have ncqa accreditation and urac accreditation for several of our specialty companies 

corporate compliance 

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls to help us assure that our values are reflected in everything we do further enhancing operations improving access to quality care and helping to safeguard against fraud waste and abuse 

three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines the cms chapter guidance and the compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 



the goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud waste abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore the board of directors has established a corporate compliance committee that among other things reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes resulting from the aca business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal and state health care reform legislation described under the heading regulation in addition changes to the political environment including recent changes resulting from the 2016 election cycle and related uncertainties may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 

in our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state federal and commercial contracts before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish adequate provider networks our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 

we also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks when contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

the relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product 

regulation 

our operations are comprehensively regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state federal or national level for example the new administration and certain members of congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue full repeal of or significant amendment to the aca even if the aca is not amended or repealed the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca the ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the new administration that would impact the current implementation of the aca remains uncertain 

the aca transformed the us health care system through a series of complex initiatives some of the acas most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or hif the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional medicaid expansion state and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the aca and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business for a further discussion of the implementation of the aca as well as the potential repeal of or changes to the aca see the risk factor below entitled “the implementation of health reform legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows ” 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider organizations ppos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other health care providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan and provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health care provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 



federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the medicaid program our medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms comprehensive legislation specifically title xviii of the social security act of 1935 as amended governs our medicare program in addition our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the health care providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

ppo regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our health care providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at both the state and federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

we must also comply with and are faceted by laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of us government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business in addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business a violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program under these state medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals within the state we also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities 

we provide medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans dsnps and medicaremedicaid plans mmp which are provided under contracts with cms and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts cms also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other cms regulations and the quality of care we provide to medicare beneficiaries under these contracts we additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation 

our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the tricare program the department of defense military and family life counseling program the us department of veterans affairs patient centered community care program and certain other health carerelated government contracts 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth certain terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things 









 we are operating under the same terms of the 2016 mou until the 2017 mou is executed 

marketplace contracts 

we operate in 15 states under federally facilitated and statebased marketplace contracts with cms that expire annually in 2016 we began operating in a federally facilitated marketplace in new hampshire as well as arizona and california that were added with the health net acquisition 

in addition we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as arkansas works in 2016 we started operating under a contract with the new hampshire department of health and human services to participate in the medicaid expansion model that new hampshire has adopted referred to as the “premium assistance program” 

privacy regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle such laws and rules include without limitation the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the federal trade commission act the grammleachbliley financial modernization act of 1999 grammleachbliley act state privacy and security laws such as the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california online privacy protection act privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation a variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the us department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 

hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys generals in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law these regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified on october 1 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

in addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our marketplace business as a result we are subject to the requirements under the payment card industry pci data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 30500  employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are positive

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltc abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging around 57 we are therefore exposed to risks associated with us and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state government to terminate contracts with it in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed and our dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity for example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltc abd and foster care furthermore medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 “sequestration” subject to a 2 cap in addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare tricare va chip ltc abd foster care and the health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

there can be no assurance that we will avoid payment delays from government payors in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity in addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenue or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs for example recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicare programs are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if our medicare operations are subject to program audits sanctions or penalties if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our star ratings our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance there are also specific additional risks under title xviii part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our part d products as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 

  

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows  

our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio hbr or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our hbr can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent viruses including the zika virus new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in addition the 2017 marketplace for individual products may be less stable than in 2016 because among other things other health plans have changed or stopped offering their health insurance marketplace products in the states we expect to serve in 2017 also member behavior could be influenced by uncertainty of potential changes to the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving health insurance marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of health reform legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 aca was enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could elect to opt out of the medicaid expansion portion of aca without losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government pays the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline ending at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years as of december 31 2016 31 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility and additional states continue to discuss expansion the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage commencing in january 2014 the aca required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations 

any failure to adequately price products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow among other things we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three rs provisions of the aca established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further the three rs may not be adequately funded moreover changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets for example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured require us to increase premium rates or result in funding issues under the three rs these potential exits and other continued volatility in this market may be further exacerbated by the conclusion of the risk corridor and reinsurance programs as of january 1 2017 our continued success in the exchanges is dependent on our ability to successfully respond to these changes in the market over time any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us department of health and human services hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the health insurance marketplaces arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 

the aca imposed an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes the fee is allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenue from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenue from the fee calculation the health insurer fee payable in 2017 was suspended by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2016 if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps required to implement the aca including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations for example in april 2016 cms issued final regulations that revised existing medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum mlr standard for medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others if we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

in addition the us court of appeals for the dc circuit has granted a motion to put a lawsuit challenging the aca’s costsharing subsidies on hold until the new administration takes over now that the us court of appeals has stayed the case the new administration and congress will decide how they want to proceed including whether to seek policy changes such as aca repeal or replacement that affect the issues under review in this case 

changes to or repeal of the aca which the new administration and certain members of congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows even if the aca is not amended or repealed the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations however the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration cannot be predicted 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare health insurance marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services including through our envolve pharmacy solutions product these businesses are subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs we provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts with the government expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses or require changes to the way we do business in addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

we contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

a number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

in the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided among others in addition the impact of healthcare reform legislation and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed in addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters for example the company’s wholly owned subsidiary health net life insurance company “hnl” is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to hnl’s payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services hnl expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices nevertheless in the event hnl receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims hnl otherwise believes are unallowable the company’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

from time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 and the grammleachbliley act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyber attack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules additionally hhs continued its auditing program in 2016 to assess compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates through a second phase of audits which commenced for covered entities in july 2016 hhs focused on a review of policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we along with all other companies involved in public health care programs are the subject of fraud and abuse investigations from time to time the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare tricare va and other federal health care programs and federally funded state health programs fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam  relators federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with health net and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

we completed the acquisition of health net on march 24 2016 the success of the acquisition of health net will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the company and health net and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the integration of health net’s business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the acquisition of health net the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the acquisition of health net and are incurring substantial expenses related to the integration of health net 

we are in the process of integrating a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits among other things in addition the businesses of centene and health net will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and woodland hills california respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the acquisition including financing of the acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we are also incurring transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs these incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs 

the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition of health net 

the market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of health net’s business with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the acquisition and integration are greater than expected the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of our acquisition of health net 

the size of our business following the acquisition of health net is significantly larger than the size of either centene’s or health net’s respective businesses prior to the acquisition our ability to successfully manage the expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity we will also have to manage our expanded operations in compliance with certain undertakings with regulators that were agreed to in connection with the approval of the acquisition these undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future operations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms there can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits 

we are significantly more leveraged today than we have previously been 

as of december 31 2016  we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately 4655 million  which is significantly greater than the indebtedness that we have previously had this increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

among other things our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio these restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies in addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

executive overview 

general 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits including estimated costs incurred and sga costs we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are not separately billed and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the sga expense ratio represents sga costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues again excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are not separately billed 

health net acquisition 

on march 24 2016 the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of health net a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and governmentsponsored managed care plans the transaction was valued at approximately 5990 million  including the assumption of 703 million  of outstanding debt the acquisition allows the company to offer a more comprehensive and scalable portfolio of solutions and provides opportunity for additional growth across the combined companys markets 2016 was a transformative year with the acquisition of health net due to the size of this acquisition the primary driver of the year over year variances discussed throughout this section are related to the acquisition of health net 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

the new us presidential administration and certain members of congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue full repeal of or significant amendment to the aca even if the aca is not amended or repealed the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the aca the ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the new administration that would impact the current implementation of the aca remains uncertain however we believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members customers and shareholders

nm not meaningful 

year ended december 31   2016  compared to year ended december 31   2015 

total revenues 

total revenues increased 78  in the year ended december 31 2016  over the corresponding period in 2015  primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the impact from expansions acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015  during the year ended december 31 2016  we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1 composite change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the hbr for the year ended december 31 2016  was 865  a decrease  of 240  basis points over the comparable period in 2015  the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to the acquisition of health net membership growth in medicaid expansion and health insurance marketplace products and improvement in hbr in the higher acuity populations also in the fourth quarter we recognized additional revenue relating to the retroactive contract amendment that changed the minimum mlr calculation under californias medicaid expansion program which reduced our 2016 hbr by 50 basis points 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 243 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the corresponding period in 2015  this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net and growth in our correctional business partially offset by lower pharmacy costs to external customers the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2016  was 855  compared to 864  in 2015  the decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of health net which operates at a lower cost of service ratio 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 1874 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the corresponding period in 2015  this was primarily due to the acquisition of health net acquisition related expenses restructuring and integration costs and the impact from expansions acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015 during the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded approximately 234 million  of health net acquisition related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 098  during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded approximately 27 million  of health net acquisition related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 014  we also recorded expense of 50 million  in 2016 for contribution commitments to our charitable foundation 

the consolidated sga expense ratio was 98  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 85  for the year ended december 31 2015 the consolidated sga expense ratio excluding health net acquisition related expenses was 92  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 83  for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in the sga expense ratio is primarily attributable to the addition of the health net business which operates at a higher sga expense ratio due to a higher mix of commercial and medicare business 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2016  reflects an increase in investment balances over 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of health net interest expense increased  during the year ended december 31 2016  by 174 million  primarily reflecting the issuance of an additional 2400 million in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction interest expense also increased due to the issuance of an additional 500 million  in senior notes in june 2016 the assumption of health nets 400 million in senior notes and the issuance of the 1200 million  in senior notes in november 2016 these increases were partially offset by the redemption of the centene 425 million   575  senior notes and the health net 400 million   6375  senior notes in november 2016 and december 2016 respectively in addition the company incurred 11 million  associated with the early redemption of the centene 575  senior notes due 2017 and the health net 6375  senior notes due 2017 which was recorded in interest expense 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  was 518  compared to 486  in 2015  the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductibility of the hif limitations on the deductibility of compensation and the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of health net 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

total revenues increased   83  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of health net and expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly california florida georgia indiana louisiana mississippi oregon texas and washington  earnings from operations increased   557 million  between years primarily reflecting the acquisition of health net and product and geographical expansions in many of our states 

specialty services 

total revenues increased   28  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015 resulting primarily from the acquisition of health net growth in our behavioral health and correctional services businesses and increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment  earnings from operations decreased   2 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to lower earnings in our specialty pharmacy home health and behavioral health businesses as well as increased utilization in several specialty services businesses partially offset by an increase in earnings related to our pharmacy benefits management and correctional services businesses and the health net acquisition

medical costs 

  

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2015  of 889  was a decrease of 40  basis points over the comparable period in 2014  the decrease compared to the previous year is primarily attributable to improvement in medical expense in the high acuity populations ltcmmp and membership growth in medicaid expansion programs and health insurance marketplace which operate at a lower hbr than traditional medicaid businesses 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 341 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the corresponding period in 2014  this was primarily due to growth in the acariahealth business the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2015  was 864  compared to 871  in 2014

sga increased by 504 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the corresponding period in 2014  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded approximately 27 million of health net acquisition related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 014  

during the first quarter of 2015 we recorded a gain of 10 million on the settlement of contingent consideration related to the community health solutions chs transaction we also recorded expense of 10 million for a contribution to our charitable foundation during the first quarter of 2015 

also during 2015 we experienced higher than anticipated optout rates and member attrition in the new michigan dual demonstration program resulting in lower than expected membership and lower blended premium rates as a result the fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced from 50 million to 16 million and we recorded a gain of 34 million in sga in connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill resulting in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of 38 million which was recorded in sga the companys initial allocation of fair value resulted in goodwill and intangible assets of 52 million at december 31 2015 the company had goodwill of 11 million and other identifiable intangible assets of 1 million net of 2 million of amortization remaining on the balance sheet 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  was 85  and 83  respectively the sga ratio for the year ended december 31 2015 was 83 excluding the impact of the health net acquisition related expenses the increase over the prior year is primarily related to the expansion of our health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher sga ratio and incurred higher open enrollment costs in the fourth quarter of 2015 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2015  reflects an increase in investment balances over 2014  and improved performance of certain equity investments interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2015  by 8 million primarily reflecting the issuance of 300 million of senior notes in april 2014 and the issuance of an additional 200 million in senior notes in january 2015 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31  2015  was 486  compared to 429  in 2014  the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee expense 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

total revenues increased 39  in the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly florida illinois indiana louisiana mississippi ohio and texas earnings from operations increased 160 million between years primarily reflecting growth in the business 

specialty services 

total revenues increased 47  in the year ended december 31 2015  resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our pharmacy businesses earnings from operations increased 81 million in the year ended december 31 2015 primarily reflecting growth in the specialty services provided to our increased managed care membership 

liquidity and capital resources 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2016  were 1851 million  or 33  times net earnings compared to 658 million  in 2015  the cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities and a decrease in other assets and premium and related receivables  additionally cash provided by operations was increased by approximately 445 million  in the fourth quarter due to the finalization of the opening balance sheet and respective cash flows for the eight day period from the march 24 2016 acquisition date to march 31 2016 

cash flows from operating activities for 2015  decreased to 658 million  compared to 1223 million  in 2014  the cash provided by operations in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables 

  

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period specifically at december 31 2016 the state of illinois was behind in processing capitation for several months we continue to monitor the receivable balance and work with the state on the timing of payments 

the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each states portion of our hif resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31 2016  during 2016  we paid the 2016  annual hif totaling 513 million  this negatively impacted our cash flows as we have not been reimbursed from many of our state customers similarly during 2015  we paid the 2015  annual hif invoice totaling 220 million the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 



cash flows used in investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 2397 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 813 million  in the comparable period in 2015  cash flows used in investing activities in 2016  primarily consisted of our acquisition of health net net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments and capital expenditures

in april 2014 pursuant to a shelf registration statement we issued 300 million 475 senior notes due may 15 2022 at par interest is paid semiannually in may and november in connection with the issuance we entered into 300 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements 2014 swap agreements that are scheduled to expire may 15 2022 under the 2014 swap agreements we receive a fixed rate of 475 and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly which allows us to adjust the 300 million notes to a floating rate we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 

liquidity metrics 

the credit agreement underlying our revolving credit facility contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debttoebitda ratios we are required to not exceed a maximum debttoebitda ratio of 35 to 10 prior to december 31 2016 and 30 to 10 on and subsequent to december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016  we had 100 million  in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2016  there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debttoebitda ratio 

we had outstanding letters of credit of 71 million  as of december 31 2016  which were not part of our revolving credit facility we also had letters of credit for 45 million  valued at the december 31 2016  conversion rate or €42 million  representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support ribera saluds outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility collectively the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 142  as of december 31 2016  in addition we had outstanding surety bonds of 365 million  as of december 31 2016  

the indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain nonfinancial and financial covenants of centene corporation including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all covenants 

at december 31 2016  we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of a negative 258 million  compared to a negative 24 million  at december 31 2015  we manage our short term and long term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term requirements as needed 

  

at december 31 2016  our debt to capital ratio defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity was 441  compared to 360  at december 31 2015  excluding the 64 million  nonrecourse mortgage note our debt to capital ratio was 437  as of december 31 2016  compared to 347  at december 31 2015  the increase in the ratio over the prior year is due to the financing associated with the health net acquisition we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure among others of our leverage and financial flexibility 

we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions we have 3 million  available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of december 31 2016  no duration has been placed on the repurchase program we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2016  2015  or 2014  

during the year ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  we received dividends of 121 million  11 million  and 50 million  respectively from our regulated subsidiaries 

2017  expectations 

during 2017 we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 250 million associated with our growth and spend approximately 520 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system integration and enhancements and market expansions these amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2017 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility however from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes either through issuance of debt or equity the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate in addition we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities andor improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes revolving credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows  in millions 

  



1 our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  includes 869 million  of other long term liabilities this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes liabilities under our deferred compensation plan reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing andor amount of any cash payment is uncertain 

commitments 

in addition in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the health net acquisition from the california department of insurance and th e california department of managed health care we committed to certain undertakings the undertakings the undertakings included among other items operational commitments around premiums dividend restrictions minimum risk based capital rbc levels local offices growth accreditation hedis scores and other quality measures network adequacy certifications investments and capital expenditures specifically we agreed to among other things 



 the undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2016  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 4529 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 2259 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  we contributed 467 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners naic we estimate our rbc percentage including kentucky spirit to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level excluding the interim impact of the health insurance fee 

under the california knoxkeene health care service plan act of 1975 as amended “knoxkeene” certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity tne requirements under these knoxkeene tne requirements actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on health care expenditures excluding capitated amounts in addition certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking 

the naic has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2016  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies such restrictions unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus statutory income and unassigned surplus as of december 31 2016 the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was 2259 million in the aggregate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset at december 31 2016  we had 4712 million  of goodwill and 1545 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date with the exception of reporting units that were recently acquired without excess fair value on the acquisition date and our home health business which maintains 267 million of goodwill during 2016 events and circumstances led to unfavorable results in the home health business which indicated that the goodwill might be impaired we completed a quantitative analysis and the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be recovered to the extent the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient in future periods the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows ” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2016  data 



while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 25 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum mlr programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2016  will be known by the end of 2017  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately 39 million  47 million  and 26 million  of the “incurred related to prior years” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

 

revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of its membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states medicaid membership we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known we continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events we and the health care providers collect compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the t3 tricare governmentsponsored managed care support contract in the north region for the dods tricare program t3 contract on a straightline basis over the option period when the fees become fixed and determinable the t3 contract includes various performancebased incentives and penalties for each of the incentives or penalties we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that it has earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straightline basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements including the “grossup” to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2016  we had short term investments of 505 million  and long term investments of 4683 million  including restricted deposits of 138 million  the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the long term investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2016  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 155 million  declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 2100 million  with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 2100 million  of our long term debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2016  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 107 million  an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors – our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the overall inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations an increase in the expected rate of inflation for healthcare costs or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to government sponsored healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

on july 2 2015  we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with health net inc health net under which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of health net under the terms of the agreement at the closing of the transaction health net stockholders with limited exceptions would receive 0622  of a validly issued fully paid nonassessable share of centene common stock and 2825  in cash for each share of health net common stock the transaction is valued at approximately 55 billion  based on the centene closing stock price on february 17 2016  including the assumption of debt the company expects to fund the cash portion of the acquisition through a combination of the debt financing completed in february 2016 borrowings on the companys revolving credit facility and existing cash on hand the transaction is expected to close in early 2016 and is subject to approvals by relevant state insurance and healthcare regulators and other customary closing conditions 

we operate in two segments managed care and specialty services our managed care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state childrens health insurance program chip long term care ltc foster care dualeligible individuals duals and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd beginning in 2014 our managed care segment also provides health plan coverage to individuals covered through federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces him our specialty services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2015  our managed care and specialty services segments accounted for 90  and 10  respectively of our total external premium and service revenues 

our managed care membership totaled 51 million  as of december 31 2015  for the year ended december 31 2015  our premium and service revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to centene were 213 billion  and 356 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 658 million  

on february 2 2015 the board of directors declared a twoforone split of centenes common stock in the form of a 100 stock dividend distributed february 19 2015 to stockholders of record on february 12 2015 all share per share and stock price information presented in this form 10k has been adjusted for the twoforone stock split 

our subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan kshp ceased serving members in kentucky as of july 6 2013 accordingly the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis with the exception of cash flow information is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

industry 

we provide our services primarily through medicaid chip ltc foster care abd medicare and other state and federal programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid and chip market was approximately 449 billion in 2013 and estimate the market will grow to 890 billion by 2024 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 139 in fiscal 2015  and states appropriated an increase of 69 for medicaid in fiscal 2016  budgets 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 96 million dualeligible enrollees in 2015  these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd ltc and mmp programs and through medicare special needs plans 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we believe recognition of the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs will continue to strengthen a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd populations 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years from 2014 through 2016 in 2017 the federal share declines to 95 in 2018 it is 94 in 2019 it is 93 and it will be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option will default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and costsharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 

our competitive strengths 

our multinational managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

  

1 adjusted ebitda represents net earnings attributable to centene corporation excluding income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization excluding senior note premium amortization stock compensation expense and health net merger related expenses a reconciliation of this nongaap measure follows  in millions 



for the year ended december 31 2015  premium and service revenues of 213 billion  have produced a five year compound annual growth rate cagr of 38 and diluted earnings per share of 289  has produced a five year cagr of 26 

 

 3 

governments we have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use inpatient days and high cost interventions as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses we work with state agencies in order to maximize the effectiveness of their programs our approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation and protecting our profitability 

 

 

 

  our business strategy 

our objective is to become the leading multinational healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and underinsured population through government sponsored healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 4 

policies and practices provider compensation and minimizing fraud waste and abuse by helping states structure an appropriate level and range of medicaid chip and specialty services we seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins provide an acceptable return and grow our business 

 

 

 

we have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 1  

  

      

1 table includes members served in each our states through our government sponsored programs health insurance marketplaces and 

correctional healthcare services 

substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the companys long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in texas and florida had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2015  

managed care 

benefits to states   

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 



 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques including case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers   

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements per diems diagnostic related grouping and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing performancebased arrangement in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies   

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

we believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management care management software dental benefits management inhome health services life and health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare dental diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa    

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have 17 of 19 eligible health plans with ncqa accreditation 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare strategy and complement our core managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 11 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the ncqa and urac also provide accreditation and certification for our specialty companies we currently have four specialty companies with ncqa accreditation or certification and five specialty companies with urac accreditation 

corporate compliance 

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls by which we assure that our values are reflected in everything we do further enhancing operations improving access to quality care and safeguarding against fraud waste and abuse 

three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines the centers for medicare and medicaid services chapter guidance and compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general or oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 12 

 

the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud waste abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore the board of directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the various managed care markets 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

regulation 

our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations hmos third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other health care providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace commercial enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization and provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health care provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our health care providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at both the state and federal levels our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or hmo in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals we also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding 







marketplace contracts 

we operate under federally facilitated and statebased marketplace contracts in 12 states with cms that expire annually in 2016 we began operating in a federally facilitated marketplace in new hampshire 

we operate under a contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as the private option this contract expires december 31 2016 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive oneyear terms in 2016 we started operating under a contract with the new hampshire department of health and human services to participate in the medicaid expansion model that new hampshire has adopted referred to as the “premium assistance program” this contract expires december 31 2016 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive oneyear terms 

the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys generals in addition to the hhs office for civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule further enhanced the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarified that genetic information is protected under hipaa and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified on october 1 2015 with the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with hipaa hitech and the omnibus rule including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against an electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and subsidiary privacy officials handle complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have we periodically review our privacy and security procedures and conduct risk assessments to ensure we promptly identify and address gaps in our processes 

other fraud waste and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act the laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly compliance with these laws may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 18200  employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are positive

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

reductions in funding or changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs with the federal share currently averaging around 57 

future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare chip ltc abd and foster care adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

lastly if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and the new health insurance marketplaces may be delayed similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

  

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies pharmaceutical compounds and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified however we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimate is adequate or that adjustments to the estimate will not unfavorably impact our results of operations 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability similarly we may face difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability in 2016 for the relatively new and evolving health insurance marketplaces 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the health reform legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline ending at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years as of december 31 2015 31 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility and additional states continue to discuss expansion the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage commencing in january 2014 the aca required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations 

our ability to adequately price products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow we may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three rs provisions of the aca established to reduce risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further the reinsurance and risk corridor components may not be adequately funded any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us department of health and human services hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the newly created health insurance marketplaces arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 

the aca imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion starting in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes the fee will be allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenue from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenue from the fee calculation if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace enrollees for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services through our envolve pharmacy solutions product each business is subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers they also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects them to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs in addition our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed or we receive an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance programs we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for three years and may be extended for additional years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services or loss of one or more of our licenses 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or we have an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of healthcare reform legislation and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar lawsuits regardless of whether any lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act and the grammleachbliley act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules in addition hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities with a focus on security risk assessments although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards were modified to version 5010 prior to the implementation of the icd10 coding system while we transitioned to the icd10 coding system in october 2015 if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2015 we may have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in higher costs and reimbursement levels or lost revenues under risk adjustment as a result the changes and complications associated with the transition to icd10 may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

companies involved in public health care programs are often the subject of fraud and abuse investigations the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicaid medicare other federal health care programs and federally funded state health programs fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights these fraud and abuse laws include the federal false claims act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 encourages states to enact stateversions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam  relators federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud and abuse a priority in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

consummation of the merger with health net is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain other conditions and we cannot predict when or if such conditions will be satisfied or waived or if in connection with the receipt of necessary approvals regulators will impose conditions on us that have an adverse effect on our business 

consummation of the merger with health net is subject to receipt of certain remaining regulatory approvals and certain other conditions including among others 

 

we cannot provide any assurance that the merger will be completed that there will not be a delay in the completion of the merger or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the merger will be realized any delay could also among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the merger in the event the merger agreement is terminated or the transaction is materially delayed for any reason the price of our common stock may be impacted regulatory authorities reviewing the merger may refuse to permit the merger or may impose restrictions or conditions on the merger that may adversely affect the company if the merger is completed 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with health net and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the company and health net which currently operate as independent public companies and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed 

the merger involves the integration of health net’s business with our existing business which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the proposed merger the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we and health net are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the merger and have not yet fully determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the merger the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized 

our financial results after the merger will depend on our ability to maintain our and health net’s business and operational relationships 

a substantial portion of each of our and health net’s revenues are received under contracts with states our success following the merger will depend in part on our ability to maintain these state contracts and other business and operational relationships including those of health net health net’s state contracts and other business and operational relationships may have termination or other rights that may be triggered by the merger or the states or other business and operational relationships may decide not to renew their existing relationships with health net or after the merger with us if health net prior to the completion of the merger and we after the completion of the merger are unable to maintain these contracts and other business and operational relationships our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected 

we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the merger and the integration of health net 

we are expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the merger and the integration of health net there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits in addition the businesses of centene and health net will continue to maintain a presence in st louis missouri and woodland hills california respectively the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the merger including financing of the merger facilities and systems consolidation costs we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs additionally as a result of the merger rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to our credit ratings this may increase our costs in connection with the financing of the merger these incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs 

failure to complete the merger could impact our stock price and our future business and financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the merger is not completed or our financing for the transaction becomes unavailable our ongoing business and financial position results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected and we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

in addition if the merger is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our providers members and employees we may also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if the merger is not completed these risks may materialize and may materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as well as the price of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger with health net 

the market price of the common stock of our company may decline as a result of the merger if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of health net’s business with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the merger are greater than expected or if the financing related to the transaction is on unfavorable terms the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the merger on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

the merger will substantially reduce the percentage ownership interests of our current stockholders it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our stockholders have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors and on certain other matters affecting the company if the merger is completed we will pay approximately 55 billion  and health net’s stockholders are expected to hold approximately 29 of the common stock of the company after the merger as a result if the merger is completed our premerger stockholders will own a smaller proportion of our outstanding common stock than the proportion of our outstanding common stock they owned before the merger and as a result they will have less influence on our management and policies following the merger than they now have on our management and policies we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to our earnings per share this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change we could also encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with the business of health net or otherwise resulting from the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock 

uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company 

centene and health net are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans the combined company’s success after the completion of the merger will depend in part upon the ability of centene and health net to retain key management personnel and other key employees prior to completion of the merger current and prospective employees of centene and health net may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the merger which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of centene and health net to attract or retain key management and other key personnel in addition no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of centene and health net to the same extent that centene and health net have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees 

the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the merger 

following the completion of the merger the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either centene’s or health net’s respective businesses the combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

the combined company will be significantly more leveraged than centene is currently 

upon completion of the merger the combined company expects to incur approximately 2382 million in additional indebtedness the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately 4136 million which is greater than the current indebtedness of centene prior to the merger the increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio of the combined company in comparison to that of centene on a historical basis will have the effect among other things of reducing the flexibility of centene to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 5 2013 the companys subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan inc kentucky spirit terminated its contract with the commonwealth of kentucky the commonwealth kentucky spirit believes it had a contractual right to terminate the contract and filed a lawsuit in franklin circuit court seeking a declaration of this right the commonwealth has alleged that kentucky spirits exit constitutes a material breach of contract the commonwealth seeks to recover substantial damages and to enforce its rights under kentucky spirits 25 million  performance bond the commonwealths attorneys have asserted that the commonwealths expenditures due to kentucky spirits departure range from 28 million  to 40 million  plus interest and that the associated cms expenditures range from 92 million  to 134 million  kentucky spirit disputes the commonwealths alleged damages and filed a lawsuit in april 2013 amended in october 2014 in franklin circuit court seeking damages against the commonwealth for losses sustained due to the commonwealths alleged breaches 

on february 6 2015 the kentucky court of appeals affirmed a franklin circuit court ruling that kentucky spirit does not have a contractual right to terminate the contract early the court of appeals also found that the contract’s liquidated damages provision “is applicable in the event of a premature termination of the contract term” on september 8 2015 kentucky spirit filed a motion for discretionary review seeking kentucky supreme court review of the finding that kentucky spirits departure constituted a breach of contract on october 9 2015 the commonwealth filed a response opposing discretionary review 

on may 26 2015 the commonwealth issued a demand for indemnification to its actuarial firm for all defense costs and any resultant monetary awards in favor of kentucky spirit arising from or related to kentucky spirits claims which are predicated upon the alleged omissions and errors in the data book and the certified actuarially sound rates on august 19 2015 the actuarial firm moved to intervene in the litigation the franklin circuit court granted the actuarial firms motion on september 8 2015 and ordered a fortyfive  day stay of all pretrial proceedings in order for the firm to review the record also on august 19 2015 the actuarial firm filed a petition seeking a declaratory judgment that it is not liable to the commonwealth for indemnification related to the claims asserted by kentucky spirit against the commonwealth on october 5 2015 the commonwealth filed an answer to the actuarial firms petition and asserted counterclaimscrossclaims against the firm

revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels we recognize reductions in revenue in the current period for these programs other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our managements judgment of the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider and hospital passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual health insurer fee hif the company recognizes revenue associated with the hif on a straight line basis when we have binding agreements for the reimbursement of the fee including the “grossup” to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature we exclude the hif and premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe they are a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and hif revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

  

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager and specialty pharmacys external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

health insurer fee 

the health insurer fee reflects the annual fee mandated by the aca to health insurers the fee is determined based on our premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue 

other income expense 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt

our subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan kshp ceased serving medicaid members in kentucky as of july 6 2013 accordingly the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

year ended december 31   2015  compared to year ended december 31   2014 

premium and service revenues 

premium and service revenues increased 36  in the year ended december 31 2015  over the corresponding period in 2014   primarily as a result of the impact from expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly florida illinois indiana louisiana mississippi ohio and texas  during the year ended december 31 2015  we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1 composite change across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31  



the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2015  of 889  was a decrease  of 40  basis points over the comparable period in 2014  the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to improvement in medical expense in the high acuity populations ltcmmp and membership growth in medicaid expansion programs and health insurance marketplace which operate at a lower hbr than traditional medicaid businesses   

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 341 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the corresponding period in 2014  this was primarily due to growth in the acariahealth business the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2015  was 864  compared to 871  in 2014  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga increased by 512 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the corresponding period in 2014  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth during the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded approximately 27 million  of health net merger related expenses which reduced our diluted earnings per share by 014  

during the first quarter of 2015 we recorded a gain of 10 million  on the settlement of contingent consideration related to the chs transaction we also recorded expense of 10 million for a contribution to our charitable foundation during the first quarter of 2015 

also during 2015 we experienced higher than anticipated optout rates and member attrition in the new michigan dual demonstration program resulting in lower than expected membership and lower blended premium rates as a result the fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced from 50 million  to 16 million  and we recorded a gain of 34 million  in general and administrative expenses in connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill resulting in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of 38 million  which was recorded in general and administrative expenses the companys initial allocation of fair value resulted in goodwill and intangible assets of 52 million at december 31 2015  the company had goodwill of 11 million  and other identifiable intangible assets of 1 million  net of 2 million  of amortization remaining on the balance sheet 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014  was 86  and 84  respectively the ga ratio for the year ended december 31 2015  was 85  excluding the impact of the health net merger related expenses the increase over prior year is primarily related to the expansion of our health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher ga ratio and incurred higher open enrollment costs in the fourth quarter of the current year   

health insurer fee 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded 215 million  of nondeductible expense for the affordable care act aca annual health insurer fee compared to 126 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as of december 31 2015  we recorded 344 million  in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the accrual for the reimbursement of the fee compared to 195 million  in 2014 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2015  reflects an increase in investment balances over 2014  and improved performance of certain equity investments interest expense increased  during the year ended december 31 2015  by 8 million  primarily reflecting the issuance of 300 million of senior notes in april 2014 and the issuance of an additional 200 million in senior notes in january 2015 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  was 486  compared to 429  in 2014  the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee expense 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

premium and service revenues increased   37  in the year ended december 31 2015   primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states particularly florida illinois indiana louisiana mississippi ohio and texas  earnings from operations increased   160 million  between years primarily reflecting growth in the business 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased   47  in the year ended december 31 2015  resulting primarily from increased service associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our pharmacy businesses  earnings from operations increased   81 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  primarily reflecting growth in the specialty services provided to our increased managed care membership   

year ended december 31   2014  compared to year ended december 31   2013   

premium and service revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 49  in the year ended december 31 2014  over the corresponding period in 2013  as a result of expansions in florida ohio washington texas and illinois growth in the acariahealth business the addition of the california and new hampshire operations and our participation in the health insurance marketplaces during the year ended december 31 2014  we received premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1 composite increase across all of our markets

medical costs 

    

the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31  



  

  

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2014  of 893  was an increase of 70  basis points over the comparable period in 2013  the increase compared to last year is primarily attributable to an increase in complex care membership over the prior year 

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 953 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the corresponding period in 2013  this was primarily due to the acquisition of and growth in our acariahealth business as well as the acquisition of us medical management the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31 2014  was 871  compared to 877  in 2013  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga increased by 383 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the corresponding period in 2013  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  was 84  and 88  respectively the year over year decrease in the ga ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2014 offset by the acquisition of us medical management and start up of health insurance marketplaces which operate at higher ga ratios 

health insurer fee 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we recorded 126 million  of nondeductible expense for the affordable care act aca annual health insurer fee as of december 31 2014  we had received signed agreements representing virtually all of the total revenue associated with the reimbursement of the aca insurer fee including the related grossup for the associated income tax effects as a result we recorded 195 million  in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the reimbursement of the fee 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2014  reflects an increase in investment balances over 2013  and improved performance of certain equity investments interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2014  by 8 million reflecting the issuance of an additional 300 million in senior notes in april 2014 and a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31  2014  was 429  compared to 398  in 2013  the increase is due to the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee which increased our effective tax rate this was partially offset by a reduction of tax expense associated with the compensation deduction limitation during 2014 the irs issued final regulations related to the compensation deduction limitation applicable to certain health insurance providers accordingly we reversed previously recorded tax expense of 14 million for prior years resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate which offset the health insurer fee impact as a result we no longer believe the deduction limitation applies 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 43  in the year ended december 31 2014  primarily as a result of expansions in florida ohio washington mississippi texas and illinois the addition of the california and new hampshire operations and our participation in the health insurance marketplaces earnings from operations increased 155 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  primarily reflecting growth in the business 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 64  in the year ended december 31 2014  resulting from growth in our acariahealth business increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment the addition of three centurion contracts and the acquisition of us medical management earnings from operations increased 32 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  primarily reflecting growth in the acariahealth business as well as favorable performance in our legacy individual health business 

liquidity and capital resources 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2015  were 658 million  18  times net earnings compared to 1223 million  in 2014  the cash provided by operations in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables 

cash flows from operating activities for 2014  increased to 1223 million  compared to 382 million  in 2013  operating cash flows in 2014 significantly benefited from the 49  premium and service revenue growth which resulted in increased medical claims liabilities in addition 2014 uniquely benefited from an increase in payables associated with various programs requiring a return of premium to state customers cash flows from operating activities benefited in 2013 due to an increase in net earnings and growth in our business 

  

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period 

the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each states portion of our hif resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31 2015  during 2015  we paid the 2015  annual hif totaling 220 million  this negatively impacted our cash flows as we have not been reimbursed from the majority of our state customers similarly during 2014  we paid the 2014  annual hif invoice totaling 126 million the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 



cash flows used in investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 813 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  and 848 million  in the comparable period in 2014  cash flows used in investing activities in 2015  primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments and capital expenditures

during the year ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  we received dividends of 11 million 50 million and 18 million respectively from our regulated subsidiaries 

2016  expectations 

in early 2016 we expect to complete the merger with health net a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers health care services through health plans and governmentsponsored managed care plans  for approximately 55 billion  in connection with the upcoming closing of the merger in february 2016 our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary escrow issuers issued approximately 14 billion   5625  senior notes due 2021  at par and 10 billion   6125  senior notes due 2024  at par the transaction will be financed through a combination of borrowings on our revolving credit facility existing cash on hand the 24 billion  february debt issuance and approximately 28 billion  in shares of centene common stock the proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the health net merger if the health net merger is not consummated the escrow issuer will be required to redeem each series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such series of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 

upon execution of the merger agreement the company negotiated the terms of a new unsecured 1000 million revolving credit facility with its banking syndicate the new 1000 million revolving credit facility is effective upon the closing of the merger and the existing 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility will be terminated simultaneously 

including the effects of potential contributions and expenditures related to health net we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 250 million during 2016  associated with our growth and spend approximately 330 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements integration and market expansions these capital contributions are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2016  and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

in january 2016 the company announced an ongoing comprehensive internal search for six hard drives that were unaccounted for in its inventory of approximately 26000 information technology it devices this incident resulted from an employee not following established procedures on storing it hardware in the process of completing its investigation in february 2016 the company received an admission from an employee to placing the six hard drives in a locked receptacle for secure destruction as a result the company satisfied itself and concluded its investigation 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in millions 

  



   

1  our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  includes 170 million  of other long term liabilities this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes liabilities under our deferred compensation plan and reserves for uncertain tax positions these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing andor amount of any cash payment is uncertain 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2015  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 2284 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 1195 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  we contributed 643 million of statutory capital to our subsidiaries we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage including kshp to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2015  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2015  data 





while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 14 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum medical loss ratio programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



 

   

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2015  will be known by the end of 2016  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions additionally as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs approximately 47 million  26 million  and 0 million  of the “incurred related to prior period” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively further claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2015  we had 842 million  of goodwill and 155 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date with the exception of reporting units that were recently acquired without excess fair value on the acquisition date

as of december 31 2015  we had short term investments of 176 million  and long term investments of 2042 million  including restricted deposits of 115 million  the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the long term investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2015  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 55 million  declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 750 million with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 750 million of our long term debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2015  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 31 million  an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to government sponsored healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

we operate in two segments managed care and specialty services our managed care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state childrens health insurance program chip long term care ltc foster care dualeligible individuals duals and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd beginning in 2014 our managed care segment also provides health plan coverage to individuals covered through federallyfacilitated and statebased health insurance marketplaces him our specialty services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2014  our managed care and specialty services segments accounted for 89   and 11  respectively of our total external premium and service revenues 

our subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan kshp ceased serving members in kentucky as of july 6 2013 accordingly the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis with the exception of cash flow information is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

our managed care membership totaled 41 million  as of december 31 2014  for the year ended december 31 2014  our premium and service revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to centene were 157 billion  and 268 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 12 billion  

on february 2 2015 the board of directors declared a twoforone split of centenes common stock in the form of a 100 stock dividend distributed february 19 2015 to stockholders of record on february 12 2015 all share per share and stock price information presented in this form 10k has been adjusted for the twoforone stock split 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

industry 

we provide our services primarily through medicaid chip ltc foster care abd medicare and other state and federal programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid and chip market was approximately 421 billion in 2012 and estimate the market will grow to 919 billion by 2023 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 102 in fiscal 2014  and states appropriated an increase of 143 for medicaid in fiscal 2015  budgets 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 96 million dualeligible enrollees in 2014  these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd and ltc programs and through medicare special needs plans 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we expect that continued pressure on state medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd populations 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years from 2014 through 2016 in 2017 the federal share declines to 95 in 2018 it is 94 in 2019 it is 93 and it will be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years states may delay medicaid expansion after 2014 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option will default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and costsharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis the congressional budget office cbo anticipates that coverage through the exchanges will increase substantially over time as more people respond to subsidies and to penalties for failure to obtain coverage cbo projects coverage through the exchanges to increase to an average of 13 million in 2015 24 million in 2016 and 25 million in each year between 2017 and 2024 

our competitive strengths 

our multinational managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

for the year ended december 31 2014 premium and service revenues of 15667 million  represented a five year compound annual growth rate cagr of 32 and diluted earnings per share of 223  represented a five year cagr of 18 

 

 

 

 

 

  our business strategy 

our objective is to become the leading multinational healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and underinsured population through government sponsored healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 4 

 

 

we have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

      

substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the companys long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in texas and florida had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2014  

managed care 

benefits to states   

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



 

 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques including case in point hermes awards us environmental protection agency and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers   

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2014  we contracted with over 59000 primary care physicians 178000 specialty care physicians and 2000 hospitals 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements per diems diagnostic related grouping and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing performancebased arrangement in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies   

 

 

 9 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management care management software dental benefits management inhome health services life and health management managed vision pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy and telehealth services when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare dental diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa    

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have 15 health plans and four specialty companies with ncqa accreditation 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate compliance 

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls by which we assure that our values are reflected in everything we do further enhancing operations improving access to quality care and safeguarding against fraud and abuse 

two standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines and compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general or oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud abuse or other compliance violations anonymously furthermore the board of directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

regulation 

our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other health care providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace commercial enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization and provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health care provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

our health care providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state which they are located in addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or applicable entity furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at both state and federal level our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 

state and federal contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state in addition several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain medicare advantage special needs plans which are regulated by cms for dual eligible individuals 

our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid and medicare sectors including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding 







 

marketplace contracts 

in 2014 we began operating under federally facilitated marketplace contracts with cms in florida georgia indiana mississippi ohio and texas in 2015 we began operating under additional federally facilitated marketplace contracts in illinois and wisconsin the federally facilitated contracts expire annually and are renewable upon mutual consent 

in 2014 we also began operating under two state based marketplace contracts in massachusetts and washington that expire annually the massachusetts contract has been extended to december 31 2015 and may be extended for up to one additional oneyear term the washington contract has been extended through december 31 2015 and is renewable annually through the state’s recertification process in addition we began operating under a state based marketplace contract with the arkansas department of human services division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as the private option in january 2014 this contract expires december 31 2015 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive oneyear terms 

hipaa omnibus rule and hitech 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the main requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule is based on the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarifies that genetic information is protected under the hipaa privacy rule and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system we are planning for an expected transition to icd10 in october 2015 

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with hipaa hitech and the omnibus rule including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have we periodically review our privacy and security procedures and conduct risk assessments to ensure we promptly identify gaps in our processes 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and regularly changing and compliance with them may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

reductions in funding or changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs with the federal share currently averaging around 57 

future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare chip ltc abd and foster care adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

lastly if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and the new health insurance marketplaces may be delayed if the federal government fails to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

  

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies pharmaceutical compounds and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified however we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimate is adequate or that adjustments to the estimate will not unfavorably impact our results of operations 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability similarly we may face difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability in 2015 for the relatively new and evolving health insurance marketplaces 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the health reform legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline ending at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years as of august 28 2014 27 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility or will be doing so in 2014 and additional states continue to discuss expansion the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage commencing in january 2014 open enrollment for coverage in 2015 began on november 15 2014 and continued until february 15 2015 the aca required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations 

our ability to adequately price products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow we may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three rs provisions of the aca established to reduce risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further the reinsurance and risk corridor components may not be adequately funded any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our attempts to diversify our business lines through participation in health insurance marketplaces established by the federal government or “federallyfacilitated marketplaces” may be impacted if the united states supreme court determines that the internal revenue service may not extend taxcredit subsidies to health insurance coverage purchased through federallyfacilitated marketplaces individuals who would have otherwise received a taxcredit subsidy may choose not to enroll for coverage through a federallyfacilitated marketplace if the supreme court makes this determination and other changes are not made by the states to remedy this 

the us department of health and human services hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the newly created health insurance marketplaces arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 

the aca imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion starting in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessments are not deductible for income tax purposes the fee will be allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenue from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenue from the fee calculation if this federal premium assessment is imposed as enacted and if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace enrollees for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs 

additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses in addition we are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services through our us script and acariahealth businesses each business is subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers they also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects them to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed or we receive an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance programs we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for three years and may be extended for additional years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services or loss of one or more of our licenses 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or we have an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of healthcare reform legislation and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar suits regardless of whether any suits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed 

we may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel if we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act and the grammleachbliley act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules in addition hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities with a focus on security risk assessments although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system while we have prepared for the transition to icd10 in october 2015 if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2015 we may have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in higher costs and reimbursement levels or lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner as a result implementation of icd 10 may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 5 2013 the companys subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan inc kentucky spirit terminated its contract with the commonwealth of kentucky the commonwealth kentucky spirit believes it had a contractual right to terminate the contract and filed a lawsuit in franklin circuit court seeking a declaration of this right the commonwealth has alleged that kentucky spirits exit constitutes a material breach of contract the commonwealth seeks to recover substantial damages and to enforce its rights under kentucky spirits 25 million  performance bond on july 3 2014 the commonwealths attorneys asserted in a letter to the cabinet for health and family services that the commonwealths expenditures due to kentucky spirits departure range from 28 million  to 40 million  plus interest and that the associated cms expenditures range from 92 million  to 134 million  kentucky spirit disputes the commonwealths alleged damages and is pursuing its own litigation claims for damages against the commonwealth 

on february 6 2015 the kentucky court of appeals affirmed a franklin circuit court ruling that kentucky spirit does not have a contractual right to terminate the contract early the court of appeals also found that the contract’s liquidated damages provision “is applicable in the event of a premature termination of the contract term” kentucky spirit intends to seek kentucky supreme court review of the finding that its departure constituted a breach of contract the commonwealth may seek review of the ruling that the liquidated damages provision is applicable in the event of a premature termination 

kentucky spirit also filed a lawsuit in april 2013 amended in october 2014 in franklin circuit court seeking damages against the commonwealth for losses sustained due to the commonwealths alleged breaches on december 9 2014 the franklin circuit court denied the commonwealths motion for partial summary judgment on kentucky spirits damages claims discovery is proceeding on those claims 

the resolution of the kentucky litigation matters may result in a range of possible outcomes if kentucky spirit prevails on its claims it would be entitled to damages if the commonwealth prevails a liability to the commonwealth could be recorded the company is unable to estimate the ultimate outcome resulting from the kentucky litigation as a result the company has not recorded any receivable or any liability for potential damages under the contract as of december 31 2014 while uncertain the ultimate resolution of the pending litigation could have a material effect on the financial position cash flow or results of operations of the company in the period it is resolved or becomes known   

excluding the kentucky matters discussed above the company is also routinely subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters in the normal course of business is uncertain the company does not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for each of the three years ended december 31 2014  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  in millions except per share data 



nm not meaningful 

revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels we recognize reductions in revenue in the current period for these programs other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our managements judgment of the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider and hospital passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses additionally our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual health insurer fee hif the company recognizes revenue associated with the hif on a straight line basis when we have binding agreements for the reimbursement of the fee including the “grossup” to reflect the hifs nontax deductible nature we exclude the hif and premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe they are a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance collectively this revenue is recorded as premium tax and hif revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

  

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager and specialty pharmacys external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

health insurer fee 

the health insurer fee reflects the annual fee mandated by the affordable care act aca to health insurers the fee is determined based on our premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue 

other income expense 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt 

discontinued operations 

our subsidiary kentucky spirit health plan kshp ceased serving medicaid members in kentucky as of july 6 2013 accordingly the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

year ended december 31   2014  compared to year ended december 31   2013 

premium and service revenues 

premium and service revenues increased 488  in the year ended december 31 2014  over the corresponding period in 2013   as a result of expansions in florida ohio washington texas and illinois growth in the acariahealth business the addition of the california and new hampshire operations and our participation in the health insurance marketplaces  during the year ended december 31 2014  we received premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1 composite increase across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31  



the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2014  of 893  was an increase  of 70  basis points over the comparable period in 2013  the increase compared to last year is primarily attributable to an increase in complex care membership over the prior year   

cost of services 

cost of services increased by 953 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the corresponding period in 2013  this was primarily due to the acquisition of and growth in our acariahealth business as well as the acquisition of us medical management 

general  administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga increased by 383 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the corresponding period in 2013  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  was 84  and 88  respectively the year over year decrease in the ga ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2014 offset by the acquisition of us medical management and start up of health insurance marketplaces which operate at higher ga ratios   

health insurer fee 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we recorded 126 million  of nondeductible expense for the affordable care act aca annual health insurer fee as of december 31 2014  we have received signed agreements representing 99 of the total revenue associated with the reimbursement of the aca insurer fee including the related grossup for the associated income tax effects as a result we recorded 195 million in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the reimbursement of the fee 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



the increase in investment income in 2014 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2013 and improved performance of certain equity investments interest expense increased  during the year ended december 31 2014  by 8 million  reflecting the issuance of an additional 300 million in senior notes in april 2014 and a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014  was 429  compared to 398  in 2013  the increase is due to the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee which increased our effective tax rate this was partially offset by a reduction of tax expense associated with the compensation deduction limitation during 2014 the irs issued final regulations related to the compensation deduction limitation applicable to certain health insurance providers as a result we no longer believe the deduction limitation applies for 2013 and 2014 accordingly we reversed previously recorded tax expense of 14 million  for prior years resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate which offset the health insurer fee impact 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment for the year ended december 31   in millions 



managed care

investment and other income net

investment income   the increase in investment income in 2013 primarily reflects an increase in investment balances over 2012 

gain on sale of investments   during 2012 we recognized 1 million in net gains primarily as a result of the liquidation of 76 million of investments held by the georgia health plan in order to meet short term liquidity needs due to delays in premium receipts from the state 

gain on sale of investment in convertible note   during 2012 we executed an agreement with a third party borrower whereby the borrower agreed to pay us total consideration of 50 million for retirement of 30 million of outstanding notes and equity ownership conversion features in certain medicaid and medicare related businesses as a result we recorded a pretax gain of 18 million in other income representing the fair value of the total consideration in excess of the carrying value of the loans on the balance sheet 

interest expense    interest expense increased during the year ended december 31 2013 by 7 million reflecting the addition of 175 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2012 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for 2013  was 398  compared to 382  in 2012  the increase in the income tax rate over 2012 resulted from a tax benefit in 2012 resulting from the clarification by a state taxing authority regarding a state income tax calculation partially offset by a nondeductible goodwill impairment in 2012 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment for the year ended december 31  in millions

liquidity and capital resources 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities for 2014  increased 841 million  or 220  compared to 2013  due to an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from the growth in the business as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from an increase in payables associated with various programs requiring a return of premium to state customers in certain circumstances 

cash flows from operating activities for 2013  increased 103 million  or 37  compared to 2012  due to an increase in net earnings between years and growth in our business additionally incentive compensation accruals increased from 2012 due to the performance of the company 

  

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we receive from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period 

the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each states portion of our hif resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31 2014 during 2014 we paid the 2014 annual hif invoice totaling 126 million  the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 



cash flows used in investing activities

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in millions 

  



   

1  our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014  includes 158 million  of other long term liabilities this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes liabilities under our deferred compensation plan and reserves for uncertain tax positions these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing andor amount of any cash payment is uncertain 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2014  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 1699 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 851 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  we contributed 401 million of statutory capital to our subsidiaries we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage including kshp to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2014  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2014  data 





while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  excluding the effect of any return of premium risk corridor or minimum medical loss ratio programs the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in millions 



 

   

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2014  will be known by the end of 2015  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2014  we had 754 million  of goodwill and 120 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount however in certain circumstances such as recent acquisitions we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors 

the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date with the exception of the us medical management reporting unit that was acquired in the current year without excess fair value on the acquisition date the fair value of the us medical management reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2014  we had short term investments of 177 million  and long term investments of 1380 million  including restricted deposits of 100 million  the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the long term investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2014  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 35 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 550 million with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of 550 million of our long term debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2014  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 25 million an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 9 million dualeligible enrollees in 2013  these dualeligible members may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dualeligibles through our abd and ltc programs and through medicare special needs plans 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

we expect that continued pressure on state medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd populations 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for 3 years from 2014 through 2016 in 2017 the federal share declines to 95 in 2018 it is 94 in 2019 it is 93 and it will be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years states may delay medicaid expansion after 2014 

health insurance marketplaces are a key component of the aca and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own marketplace or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option will default to a federallyfacilitated marketplace premium and costsharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to marketplaces is limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and outofpocket costs premium subsidies will be provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the marketplaces these subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis in may 2013 the congressional budget office cbo estimated approximately 7 million individuals would enroll through marketplaces by 2014 with the number increasing to 25 million by 2025 however recent reports have indicated lower than anticipated enrollment for 2014 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

  our business strategy 

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and underinsured population through government sponsored healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the companys long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in texas had revenues from the state government that represent 37 of our consolidated total revenues from continuing operations in 2013  

managed care 

benefits to states   

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education outreach andor case management techniques including case in point hermes awards and national health information awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 7 

anywhere anytime to all authorized users including health plan staff greatly facilitating coordinated care among providers 

 

 

 

 

 

providers   

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2013  we contracted with over 50000 primary care physicians 165000 specialty care physicians and 2000 hospitals 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements per diems diagnostic related grouping and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies   

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health life and health management managed vision telehealth services pharmacy benefits management and specialty pharmacy when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare dental diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations transportation ambulance services and durable medical equipment 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa    

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have nine health plans and three specialty companies with ncqa accreditation 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in april 2013 we acquired acariahealth a comprehensive specialty pharmacy company with this transaction we expanded our specialized pharmacy benefit services for complex diseases including hepatitis c hemophilia multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and oncology 

 

corporate compliance 

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls by which we assure that our values are reflected in everything we do further enhance operations improve access to quality care and safeguard against fraud and abuse 

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines and compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general or oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and various resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud abuse or other compliance violations furthermore the board of directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

regulation 

our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations third party administrators utilization review andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 12 

 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

our mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 

state contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

our state contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 



 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding 





 

marketplace contracts 

beginning in 2014 we began operating under federally facilitated marketplace contracts with cms in seven states arkansas florida georgia indiana mississippi ohio and texas these contracts expire annually and are renewable upon mutual consent 

in 2014 we also began operating under two state based marketplaces in massachusetts and washington that expire annually the massachusetts contract may be extended for up to two additional oneyear terms the washington contract is renewable annually through the states recertification process 

in addition we began operating under a contract with the arkansas division of medical services and the arkansas insurance department to participate in the medicaid expansion model that arkansas has adopted referred to as the private option in january 2014 this contract expires december 31 2014 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive one year terms 

hipaa omnibus rule and hitech 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the main requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights the hipaa omnibus rule is based on the changes under the hitech acts and the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina which clarifies that genetic information is protected under the hipaa privacy rule and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes this omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 

the privacy and security rules and hitechomnibus enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act and omnibus rule established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system we are planning for an expected transition to icd10 in october 2014 

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with hipaa hitech and the omnibus rule including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and regularly changing and compliance with them may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 8800  employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are positive

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

reductions in funding or changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region and benefit mix since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs with the federal share currently averaging around 57 

future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid medicare chip ltc abd and foster care adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases a reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

lastly if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under medicaid medicare chip ltc abd foster care and the new health insurance marketplaces may be delayed if the federal government fails to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

  

failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers for example our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue would increase and our profits would decline because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies pharmaceutical compounds and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified however we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimate is adequate or that adjustments to the estimate will not unfavorably impact our results of operations 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability similarly we may face difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability beginning in january 2014 when we begin providing coverage for the first time under the newly created health insurance marketplaces 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

the implementation of the health reform legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012 the court determined that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs 

under the aca medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to each states election the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for 3 years 2014 through 2016 beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline to 90 by 2020 and subsequent years to date 25 states have expanded medicaid eligibility and the remaining states are involved in a variety of legislative proposals the aca also extended chip through september 30 2019 

the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage commencing in january 2014 open enrollment began on october 1 2013 and continues until march 31 2014 the aca required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations 

our ability to adequately price products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow we may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three rs provisions of the aca established to reduce risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product further the reinsurance component may not be adequately funded any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us department of health and human services hhs has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the newly created health insurance marketplaces arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1 2014 

the aca imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 8 billion starting in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessments are not deductible for income tax purposes the fee will be allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee market share is based on commercial medicare and medicaid premium revenue notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenue from medicare medicaid and chip and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenue from the fee calculation if this federal premium assessment is imposed as enacted and if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government in addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry 

practices and private litigation in the commercial sector in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid medicare and health insurance marketplace enrollees for example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements 

the frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers in addition changes in political party or administrations at the federal or state level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to rebate premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue 

the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards for example under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs specifically several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties also states may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services through our us script and acariahealth businesses each business is subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers they also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects them to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed or we receive an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance programs we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our government contracts are generally intended to run for three years and may be extended for additional years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding 

eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies 

we are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services or loss of one or more of our licenses 

if any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or we have an adverse review audit or investigation our business will suffer our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

  

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 

in connection with startup operations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims we may experience delays in operational start dates as a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be 

unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

  

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries as part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of healthcare reform legislation and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may 

be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in any particular market physicians and healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar suits regardless of whether any suits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any 

litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events in the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date however future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules in addition hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system while we have prepared for the transition to icd10 in october 2014 if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2014 we may have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in higher costs and reimbursement levels or lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be 

reliable or available in a timely manner as a result implementation of icd 10 may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks 

security breaches may arise from external or internal threats external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information we experience attempted external hacking attacks on a regular basis we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations

we own our corporate office headquarters buildings and land located in st louis missouri we generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in october 2012 the company notified the kentucky cabinet for health and family services cabinet that it was exercising a contractual right that it believes allows the company to terminate its medicaid managed care contract with the commonwealth of kentucky commonwealth effective july 5 2013 the company also filed a lawsuit in franklin circuit court against the commonwealth seeking a declaration of the companys right to terminate the contract on july 5 2013 in april 2013 the commonwealth answered that lawsuit and filed counterclaims against the company seeking declaratory relief and damages in may 2013 the franklin circuit court ruled that kentucky spirit does not have a contractual right to terminate the contract early kentucky spirit has appealed that ruling to the kentucky court of appeals 

the company also filed a formal dispute with the cabinet for damages incurred under the contract which was later appealed to and denied by the finance and administration cabinet in response the company filed a lawsuit in april 2013 in franklin circuit court seeking damages against the commonwealth for losses sustained due to the commonwealths alleged breaches this lawsuit was subsequently consolidated with the original lawsuit for declaratory relief and continues to proceed 

kentucky spirits efforts to resolve issues with the commonwealth were unsuccessful and on july 5 2013 kentucky spirit proceeded with its previously announced exit the commonwealth has alleged that kentucky spirits exit constitutes a material breach of contract the commonwealth seeks to recover substantial damages and to enforce its rights under kentucky spirits 250 million performance bond any claim for damages by the commonwealth may include the costs of transition and the additional costs to the commonwealth to cover kentucky spirits former members through july 5 2014 kentucky spirit is pursuing its litigation claims for damages against the commonwealth and will vigorously defend against any allegations that it has breached the contract 

the resolution of the kentucky litigation matters may result in a range of possible outcomes if the company prevails on its claims kentucky spirit would be entitled to damages under its lawsuit if the commonwealth prevails a liability to the commonwealth could be recorded the company is unable to estimate the ultimate outcome resulting from the kentucky 

litigation as a result the company has not recorded any receivable or any liability for potential damages under the contract as of december 31 2013  while uncertain the ultimate resolution of the pending litigation could have a material effect on the financial position cash flow or results of operations of the company in the period it is resolved or becomes known 

excluding the kentucky matters discussed above the company is also routinely subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters in the normal course of business is uncertain the company does not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on its financial position cash flow or results of operations

revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels we recognize reductions in revenue in the current period for these programs other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our managements judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider and hospital passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 

the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

  

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager and specialty pharmacys external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

other income expense

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



investment income   the increase in investment income in 2013 primarily reflects an increase in investment balances over 2012

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2012 of 896  was an increase of 490  basis points over the comparable period in 2011 the increase compared to last year primarily reflects 1 a high level of medical costs in the march 1 2012 expansion areas in texas 2 a high level of medical costs in our individual health business especially for policies issued to members who converted in the first quarter of 2012 and 3 a high level of flu costs during the fourth quarter of 2012 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga increased by 993 million  in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth partially offset by a reduction in performance based compensation expense in 2012 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 88  and 114  respectively the year over year decrease in the ga expense ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2012 and a reduction in performance based compensation expense in 2012 which lowered the ga expense ratio by approximately 60 basis points 

impairment loss 

during 2011 the company completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and concluded that the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our impairment testing date specifically the company tested its celtic reporting unit under a quantitative model which included anticipated financial performance for new business to be converted in 2012 under the quantitative model the testing revealed that the carrying value exceeded fair value of the celtic reporting unit by approximately 190 

during 2012 our subsidiary celtic insurance company experienced a high level of medical costs for individual health policies especially for recently issued policies related to members converted from another insurer during the first quarter of 2012 additionally in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act among other things limits the profitability of the individual health insurance business because of minimum medical loss ratios guaranteed issue policies and increased competition in the marketplace product as a result of these factors our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than previous estimates and we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the celtic reporting unit the impairment analysis resulted in goodwill and intangible asset impairments of 280 million recorded as an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations the impaired identifiable intangible assets of 23 million and goodwill of 257 million were reported under the specialty services segment 266 million of the impairment loss is not deductible for income tax purposes 

investment and other income net

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment for the year ended december 31  in millions

cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities for 2013  increased 1038 million  or 37  compared to 2012  due to an increase in net earnings between years and growth in our business additionally incentive compensation accruals increased from 2012 due to the performance of the company this accrual will be paid during the first and second quarter of 2014 

cash flows from operating activities for 2012  increased 170 million  or 6  compared to 2011  driven by lower net earnings that were partially offset by the growth in medical claims liabilities associated with business expansions 

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we receive from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 



net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was negatively impacted by the timing of payments from our states by 1204 million as of december 31 2011 we had received all december 2011 capitation payments from our states and had not received any prepayments of january 2012 capitation this was offset by an increase in medical claims liabilities related to the start up of our mississippi illinois and kentucky health plans as well as expansion of our texas health plan in 2011

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claims information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2013  data 





while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 70 million for the year ended december 31 2013  the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 



 

   

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2013  will be known by the end of 2014  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits 

related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

  

   

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2013  we had 3484 million  of goodwill and 488 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2013  we had short term investments of 1021 million  and long term investments of 8388 million  including restricted deposits of 469 million  the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the long term investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date substantially all of our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2013  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 232 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we entered into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of our 250 million senior note debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2013  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 83 million an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include healthcare cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a diversified multiline healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to the rising number of underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach to managing our health plans including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

we operate in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state childrens health insurance program chip longterm care ltc foster care dual eligible individuals in medicare special needs plans and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd as of december 31 2012  medicaid accounted for 77  of our atrisk membership while chip also including foster care and abd also including medicare accounted for 9  and 12  respectively hybrid programs and longterm care represent the remaining 2  atrisk membership our specialty services segment offers products for behavioral health care management software health insurance exchanges individual health insurance life and health management ltc programs managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries our health plans in arizona operated by our longterm care company and massachusetts operated by our individual health insurance provider are included in the specialty services segment 

our atrisk managed care membership totaled 26 million  as of december 31 2012  for the year ended december 31 2012  our premium and service revenues and net earnings attributable to centene were 82 billion  and 19 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 2787 million  

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

industry 

we provide our services to the uninsured primarily through medicaid chip ltc foster care abd medicare and other state programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid and chip market was approximately 401 billion in 2010 and estimate the market will grow to 957 billion by 2021 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 20 in fiscal 2012  and states appropriated an increase of 38 for medicaid in fiscal 2013 budgets 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs chip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 9 million dual eligible enrollees in 2012  these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our abd and ltc programs and through medicare special needs plans 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives additionally a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured estimated that there were approximately 48 million nonelderly americans in 2011 that lacked health insurance we expect that continued pressure on state medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd populations 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision the supreme court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage will be expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for 3 years from 2014 through 2016 in 2017 the federal share declines to 95 in 2018 it is 94 in 2019 it is 93 and it will be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years states may delay medicaid expansion after 2014 but the federal payment rates will be less 

health insurance exchanges are a key component of the aca and the marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to obtain health insurance states have the option of operating their own exchange or partnering with the federal government states choosing neither option will default to a federallyfacilitated exchange all exchanges regardless of how they are administered must be ready to begin enrolling consumers on october 1 2013 and must be fully operational on january 1 2014 premium and costsharing subsidies will be available to make coverage more affordable and access to exchanges will be limited to us citizens and legal immigrants insurers will be required to offer a minimum level of benefits with four levels of coverage that vary based on premiums outofpocket costs and benefits beyond the minimum required plus a catastrophic coverage plan premium subsidies will be provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the exchanges these subsidies will be offered on a sliding scale basis congressional budget office cbo estimates approximately 9 million individuals enrolling through exchanges by 2014 and the number increasing to 25 million by 2025 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

  our business strategy 

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and underinsured population and state funded healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the companys long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in texas had revenues from the state government that represent 36 of our consolidated total revenues in 2012  

medicaid managed care 

benefits to states   

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 



 



we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

 

empowering members through educational materials specifically developed for our members is a key part of this program our “your pregnancy guide” has received several awards including a national health information awards silver medal in 2010 and the web health awards gold medal in 2010 for the audio book in addition start smart has also cowritten a book for the first year of life with the american academy of pediatrics a guide to your babys carethe first year this book received a national health information award bronze medal in 2011 as well as a web health awards merit medical for the audio book 

start smart continues to be recognized by multiple organizations in 2010 start smart won the platinum award for consumer empowerment at the urac quality summit and was awarded the 2010 urac  gken international health promotion award for community health start smart was recognized in ncqa quality profiles focus on patient engagement as a featured program in 2011 start smart won the casein point platinum awards womenschildrens category for the 17p program in 2010 and the breastfeeding program in 2012 the program has been featured in several issues of the medicaid health plans of america mhpa best practices compendium as well as a video feature on the mhpa website the results of the start smart program have also been published in several peer reviewed articles our paper “effects of a pregnancy management program on birth outcomes in managed medicaid” published in managed care in april 2011 was presented at the care continuum alliance as a finalist for the 2012 population health award in august 2012 the american journal of perinatology published the results of our 17p program “pregnancy outcomes of managed medicaid members prescribed home administration of 17 alphahydroxyprogesterone caproate”

providers   

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2012  the health plans we currently operate contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 



our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservice per diems diagnostic related grouping and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies   

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

    

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health life and health management managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where dental care is a provided benefit 

quality management   

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa    

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote health care quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members we currently have six health plans and three specialty companies with ncqa accreditation 

specialty services   

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core medicaid managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 12 

 

 

in 2013 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire acariahealth one of the nation’s largest independent comprehensive specialty pharmacy companies with this transaction we will expand our specialized pharmacy benefit services for complex diseases including hepatitis c hemophilia multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and oncology 

 

corporate compliance   

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines and compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services office of the inspector general or oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and various resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct fraud abuse or other compliance violations furthermore the board of directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition   

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve”   

regulation   

our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations third party administrators utilization review andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid or medicare enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends   

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company 

state contracts 

in addition to being a licensed insurance company or health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the states medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

our state contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 



 

 

a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding 





 

hipaa and hitech 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information among the main requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the disclosure of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act which was enacted as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

the privacy and security rules and hitech enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates other requirements of the privacy regulations include 

 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there is a patchwork of state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system we are planning for an expected transition to icd10 in october 2014 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws contrary to hipaa to prevail if the secretary determines that 

 

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with both hipaa and hitech including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and regularly changing and compliance with them may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 6800  employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid chip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid chip and abd premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories since medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs with the federal share currently averaging around 57 future levels of medicaid chip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively referred to as the affordable care act aca were enacted while the constitutionality of the aca was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in june 2012 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the aca with one limited exception relating to the medicaid expansion provision the court held that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs under the aca medicaid coverage will be expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level beginning january 1 2014 subject to the states elections the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for 3 years from 2014 through 2016 in 2017 the federal share declines to 95 in 2018 it is 94 in 2019 it is 93 and it will be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years states may delay medicaid expansion after 2014 but the federal payment rates will be less it is unknown as to what states will expand their medicaid programs although certain states including florida louisiana and texas have indicated that they will not do so 

although states are currently required by law to maintain current medicaid eligibility standards until at least 2014 at least one state has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the “maintenance of effort” moe provision based on the supreme court’s decision states may also seek to reduce reimbursement or benefits to enable them to afford to maintain their eligibility levels 

states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd the current adverse economic conditions have and are expected to continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while these eligible populations increase creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies with whom we contract to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for current programs and program expansions contraction of covered benefits limited or no premium rate increases or premium decreases in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd costs and eligibility if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

changes to medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order to afford to maintain eligibility levels a number of states have requested waivers to the requirements to maintain eligibility levels and legislation has been introduced that would eliminate the requirement that eligibility levels be maintained we believe that reductions in medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

  

if we are unable to participate in chip programs our growth rate may be limited 

chip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in chip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

if chip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

federal support for chip has been authorized through 2019 with funding authorized through 2015 we cannot be certain that funding for chip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2015 thus we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their chip programs which have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have chip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid chip and abd we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire or renew between june 30 2013 and december 31 2016 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on april 12 2010 the wisconsin department of health services notified us that our wisconsin subsidiary was not awarded a southeast wisconsin badgercare plus managed care contract while we will continue to serve other regions of the state we transitioned the affected members to other plans by november 1 2010 further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis our business will suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

  

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

the aca also requires that proposed increases of 10 or more of premiums for most individual and small group insurance health insurance plans must be approved by state or federal officials rate review program 

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues most states including but not limited to georgia indiana texas and wisconsin have implemented promptpayment laws and many states are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

if we fail to comply with medicare laws and regulation our growth rate could be limited 

we feel there are potential growth opportunities in dual eligible markets to fully integrate care for dual eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate amount of state and federal health care spending yet less than 15 percent of dual eligibles are in comprehensive managed care as a result states and the federal government have put dual eligibles on the fast track to managed care and dual eligibles are an important part of our growth strategy 

although we believe that we substantially comply with all existing medicare statutes and regulations applicable to our business different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make significant changes to our operations if we fail to comply with existing or future applicable medicare laws and regulations states may not allow us to continue to participate in dual eligible demonstration programs or we may fail to win bids to participate in such programs and our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state and federal government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state and federal governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

  

• cancellation of our contracts 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services or 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid chip ltc foster care and abd programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa and will have to expend additional time and financial resources to comply with the hipaa provisions contained in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 and the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general 

  

beginning in 2014 the aca requires that policies of health insurance offered in individual and small group markets as well as medicaid benchmark plans provide coverage of designated items and services known as essential health benefits these must include at least 10 legally defined benefit categories hhs has granted states significant flexibility in establishing what constitutes essential health benefits in their states the diversity of essential health benefits across states will increase the complexity in managing health plans and may affect payments 

initiatives have begun in at least 26 states to more efficiently care for people who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid as a result hospitals are seeking higher medicare reimbursement rates for these patients from insurers which could negatively impact profits 

the health care reform law and the implementation of that law could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

  

the aca provides comprehensive changes to the us health care system which are being phased in at various stages through 2018 the legislation imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 8 billion starting in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessment may not be deductible for income tax purposes if this federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if the cost of the federal premium tax is not included in the calculation of our rates or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new tax our results of operations financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

there are numerous outstanding steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities 

although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our business may be materially adversely affected 

  

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

  

changes in funding for medicaid may affect our business for example on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 23 2008 the united states district court for the district of columbia vacated the final rule as improperly promulgated on november 30 2010 cms issued final regulations that remove these provisions and restore the regulatory language that was in place before the 2007 regulations were issued while this rule has been removed we cannot predict whether another similar rule or any other rule that changes funding mechanisms will be promulgated and if any are what impact they will have on our business 

  

legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and required states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs 

medicaid spending by the federal government could be decreased as part of the spending cuts associated with the the debt ceiling 

  

the sequestration transparency act of 2012 pl 112155 requires president obama to submit to congress a report on the potential sequestration triggered by the failure of the joint selective committee on deficit reduction to propose and congress to enact a plan to reduce the deficit by 12 trillion as required by the budget control act of 2011 under the sequestration automatic spending cuts would have become effective beginning january 2 2013 this would result in cuts of 2 111 billion to medicare although medicare is impacted medicaid programs are not subject to automatic spending cuts however on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which among other things delayed such automatic spending cuts until march 1 2013 

  

we cannot predict whether congress will take any action to change the automatic spending cuts further we cannot predict how states will react to any changes that occur at the federal level 

  

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

while we utilize our predictive modeling technology and our executive dashboard we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted medical expense by 97 million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 2006 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for example we commenced operations in kentucky in november 2011 in louisiana in february 2012 in missouri and washington in july 2012 and expanded in texas in march 2012 for a period of time after the inception of business in these states we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible for medicaid under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability and utilization patterns 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

assumptions and estimates are utilized in establishing premium deficiency reserves in october 2012 we notified the kentucky cabinet for health and family services that we were exercising a contractual right that we believe allows kentucky spirit to terminate its medicaid managed care contract with the commonwealth of kentucky effective july 5 2013 as a result we recorded a premium deficiency reserve included in medical costs expense of 415 million  for the kentucky contract in the year ended december 31 2012  the premium deficiency reserve encompasses the contract period from january 1 2013 through july 5 2013 if our assumptions are inaccurate our reserves may be inadequate to pay medical costs and there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition in addition if the contract is not terminated effective july 5 2013 we may be required to increase our premium deficiency reserve and there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues profitability or cash flows 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to certain providers without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers’ completeness and quality of claims submission our processing of the claim submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states’ encounter systems and the states’ acceptance and analysis of the encounter data if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership our earnings will be affected negatively 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs or uncontrollable epidemic or pandemic costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in 2009 the h1n1 influenza pandemic resulted in heightened costs due to increased physician visits and increased utilization of hospital emergency rooms and pharmaceutical costs we cannot predict what impact an epidemic or pandemic will have on our costs in the future additionally we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

  

as of december 31 2012  we had 9831 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 6495 million  of longterm investments and restricted deposits we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which may include asset backed securities bank deposits commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury and other government corporations and agencies insurance contracts and equity securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

our investments in state municipal and corporate securities are not guaranteed by the united states government which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation liquidity or financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  we had 5397 million  of investments in state municipal and corporate securities these securities are not guaranteed by the united states government state and municipal securities are subject to additional credit risk based upon each local municipality’s tax revenues and financial stability as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

  

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan or 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate startup operations into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business for example effective july 2008 we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group inc the parent company of celtic insurance company or celtic celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families while we believed that the addition of celtic would be complementary to our business we had not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

business expansion costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover business expansion costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse affect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has been restricted such conditions may persist during 2013 and beyond in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses make payments on our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that if credit could be obtained the terms and costs of such credit could be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal or rfp process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

  

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

  

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of health care reform and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs increases in the number of competitors and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

  

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions credentialing or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates additionally the number of individuals eligible for medicaid managed care will likely increase as a result of the health care reform legislation we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal or state funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

  

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

  

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

  

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

  

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

  

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management for example we have been named in a recentlyfiled securities lawsuit seeking class action and we have in the past or may be subject to in the future irs examinations securities class action lawsuits or similar regulatory actions any such matters could harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 2766 million  as of december 31 2012  we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance for example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment 

if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 

an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 further expands the coverage of hipaa by among other things extending the privacy and security provisions requiring new disclosures if a data breach occurs mandating new regulations around electronic medical records expanding enforcement mechanisms allowing the state attorneys general to bring enforcement actions and increasing penalties for violations despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations

 item 2 properties   

we own our corporate office headquarters buildings and land located in st louis missouri during 2010 our capital expenditures included costs for the construction of a new real estate development on our property which has accommodated our growing business during 2011 our capital expenditures also included costs for the construction of a new datacenter 

we generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in october 2012 the company notified the kentucky cabinet for health and family services that it was exercising a contractual right that it believes allows the company to terminate its medicaid managed care contract with the commonwealth of kentucky effective july 5 2013 the company has also filed a formal dispute with the cabinet for damages incurred under the contract that dispute is currently on appeal to the finance and administration cabinet in addition the company has filed a lawsuit in franklin circuit court against the commonwealth of kentucky seeking declaratory relief as a result of the commonwealths failure to completely and accurately disclose material information on january 23 2013 the franklin circuit court denied the commonwealths motion to dismiss and retained jurisdiction of the lawsuit but stayed the proceedings pending a formal written determination by the finance and administration cabinet 

the company is routinely subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain the company does not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

summarized comparative financial data for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  is as follows  in millions 



revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire states membership some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our managements judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider and hospital passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 

the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

  

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit managers external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

other income expense 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of uhp our new jersey health plan accordingly the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented we completed the sale in the first quarter of 2010 

year ended december 31 2012  compared to year ended december 31   2011 

premium and service revenues 

premium and service revenues increased 590  in the year ended december 31 2012  over the corresponding period in 2011  as a result of the additional revenue from our illinois kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri and washington contracts texas and arizona expansions pharmacy carveins in texas and ohio and organic membership growth during the year ended december 31 2012  we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 25 composite increase across all of our markets 

the state of georgia maintains a reconciliation process associated with membership eligibility and has continued to reconcile membership from previous periods as far back as 2006 the amount of any reduction to revenue related to this review is subject to consideration of rate adequacy calculations as part of actuarially sound standards for the appropriate periods we have estimated the revenue impact related to reconciliation adjustments to the retroactive eligibility reductions due to the state and have adjusted our accrual in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that future adjustment of amounts related to membership reconciliations will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

premium tax revenue 

premium tax revenue increased 1686  in the year ended december 31 2012  over the corresponding period in 2011  as a result of one of our states paying us approximately 180 million during the year to immediately pass through to specified providers 

operating expenses 

medical costs 

the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31  



the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2012  of 916  was an increase  of 640  basis points over the comparable period in 2011  the increase compared to last year primarily reflects 1 the continued high level of medical costs in kentucky including a 415 million  premium deficiency reserve for for the contract period january 1 2013 through july 5 2013 2 a high level of medical costs in the march 1 2012 expansion areas in texas 3 a high level of medical costs in our individual health business especially for policies issued to members who converted in the first quarter of 2012 and 4 a high level of flu costs during the fourth quarter of 2012 excluding our kentucky operations the hbr for the year ended december 31 2012  was 896 compared to 847 for the year ended december 31 2011 

general  administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga increased by 1176 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the corresponding period in 2011  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth partially offset by a reduction in performance based compensation expense in 2012 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  was 86  and 113  respectively the year over year decrease  in the ga expense ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2012 and a reduction in performance based compensation expense in 2012 which lowered the ga expense ratio by approximately 60 basis points 

impairment loss 

during 2011 the company completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and concluded that the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our impairment testing date specifically the company tested its celtic reporting unit under a quantitative model which included anticipated financial performance for new business to be converted in 2012 under the quantitative model the testing revealed that the carrying value exceeded fair value of the celtic reporting unit by approximately 190 

during the second quarter of 2012 our subsidiary celtic insurance company experienced a high level of medical costs for individual health policies especially for recently issued policies related to members converted from another insurer during the first quarter of 2012 additionally in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act among other things limits the profitability of the individual health insurance business because of minimum medical loss ratios guaranteed issue policies and increased competition in the exchange market as a result of these factors our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than previous estimates and we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the celtic reporting unit the impairment analysis resulted in goodwill and intangible asset impairments of 280 million recorded as an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations the impaired identifiable intangible assets of 23 million and goodwill of 257 million were reported under the specialty services segment 266 million of the impairment loss is not deductible for income tax purposes 

other income expense 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



investment income   the increase in investment income in 2012 primarily reflects higher investment balances in 2012 

gain on sale of investments   during the year ended december 31 2012  we recognized 15 million  in net gains primarily as a result of the liquidation of 755 million of investments held by the georgia health plan in order to meet shortterm liquidity needs due to delays in premium receipts from the state 

gain on sale of investment in convertible note   between july 2008 and october 2011 we made an investment of 300 million in secured notes receivable to a third party as part of an investment in certain medicaid and medicare related businesses the notes included a feature to convert the note balance into an equity ownership in the underlying businesses in september 2012 we executed an agreement with the borrower whereby the borrower agreed to pay us total consideration of 500 million for retirement of the outstanding notes and equity ownership conversion feature as a result during the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a pretax gain of 179 million in other income representing the fair value of the total consideration in excess of the carrying value of the loans on the balance sheet 

interest expense    interest expense increased  during the year ended december 31 2012  by 02 million  reflecting the issuance of an additional 175 million in senior notes in november 2012 partially offset by the refinancing of our 250 million senior notes and execution of the associated interest rate swap agreement in may 2011 

income tax expense 

in the year ended december 31 2012  we recorded a tax benefit of 03 million  compared to tax expense of 665 million  in the corresponding period in 2011 the tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily resulted from decreased earnings in 2012 and a tax benefit resulting from the clarification by a state taxing authority regarding a state income tax calculation accordingly we reversed the reserve associated with the uncertain tax position and recognized a net tax benefit of 58 million  these tax benefits were partially offset by celtics nondeductible goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter of 2012 

noncontrolling interest 

in the year ended december 31 2012  we recorded a 132 million  add back of expense attributable to noncontrolling interest in our louisiana and missouri health plans and casenet during the fourth quarter of 2012 we acquired the remaining ownership interest in casenet and our louisiana health plan bringing our ownership to 100 in the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded a 29 million  reduction in earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in casenet 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment for the year ended december 31  in millions 



medicaid managed care

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased   719  in the year ended december 31 2012  due to 1 the carvein of pharmacy services in texas and ohio 2 specialty company revenue related to the growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership and 3 the arizona expansion earnings from operations increased   188 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  reflecting growth in our pharmacy business and the associated specialty services provided to our increased medicaid membership partially offset by the impairment loss of 280 million recorded in the second quarter of 2012 and a high level of medical costs in celtic insurance company especially for members converted in the first quarter of 2012 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 209 in 2011 over 2010 as a result of membership growth discussed under the heading “membership” the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments in 2011 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 09 composite decrease across all of our markets

medical costs 

    

the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31  



  

  

the consolidated hbr of 852 for 2011 represented a 03 decrease from the 2010 consolidated hbr of 855 the decrease is primarily due to lower levels of utilization and contract enhancements 

general and administrative expenses 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 113 and 112 respectively the increase in the ratio in 2011 primarily reflects increased business expansion costs to support new business in illinois kentucky louisiana and texas partially offset by the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 

investment and other income net 

the following table summarizes the components of other income expense for the year ended december 31   in millions 



investment income    the decrease in investment income in 2011 reflects the continued low market interest rates partially offset by an increase in investment balances

interest expense    interest expense for 2011 increased by 23 million from 2010 primarily due to borrowings on the mortgage loan associated with the real estate development including our corporate headquarters the real estate development was placed in service in the third quarter of 2010 and accordingly we ceased capitalizing interest on the project the increase in interest expense was partially offset by reduced interest expense reflecting the refinancing of our senior notes and lower interest rate as a result of the execution of the associated interest rate swap agreements in 2011 

income tax expense 

excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate in 2011 was 374 compared to 397 in 2010 the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a higher rate in 2010 resulting from legislation enacted in may 2010 in the state of georgia which replaced the state income tax with a premium tax for medicaid managed care organizations effective july 1 2010 accordingly a deferred tax asset of 17 million related to georgia state net operating loss carry forwards was written off during 2010 additionally the higher effective tax rate in 2010 was also related to a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we receive from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment which we record as a receivable we typically receive capitation payments monthly however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 



the cash provided by operations in 2012  was primarily related to an increase in medical claims liabilities related to the start up of our louisiana missouri and washington plans and the expansion of our texas health plan as well as prepayment of premiums in one of our states at december 31 2012 partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables resulting from our health plan growth in 2012

under the terms of our revolving credit facility debt covenants at december 31 2012 we were required to maintain a maximum total debt to ebitda ratio of 275 as of december 31 2012 our borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility would have been limited as a result of this ratio in february 2013 we amended our 350 million revolving credit facility to add an additional pricing tier increase the maximum total debt to ebitda ratio during the first three quarters of 2013 to provide for increased borrowing availability and change the maximum total debt to ebitda ratio to 30 as of december 31 2013 and thereafter 

at december 31 2012  we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 1765 million  as compared to 1024 million  at december 31 2011  we manage our shortterm and longterm investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm requirements as needed

2013 expectations 

in january 2013 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire acariahealth one of the nation’s largest independent comprehensive specialty pharmacy companies for 1520 million the transaction consideration is anticipated to be financed through a combination of approximately 60 centene common stock with the remainder from cash on hand and existing credit facilities the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013 subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions 

we expect to make capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 450 million during 2013 associated with our growth these capital contributions are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2013 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility along with the issuance of shares of centene common stock in connection with the acquisition of acariahealth discussed above will be sufficient to finance our general operations planned acquisition of acariahealth and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2012  our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 9903 million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 6170 million  excluding our kentucky health plan we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2012  each of our health plans was in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financials statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with managements judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

  

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2012  data 





while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 58 million for the year ended december 31 2012  the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 



 

   

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2012  will be known by the end of 2013  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the members acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2012  we had 2563 million  of goodwill and 203 million  of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments and debt 

as of december 31 2012  we had shortterm investments of 1391 million  and longterm investments of 6495 million  including restricted deposits of 348 million  the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2012  the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 178 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we entered into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of our 250 million senior note debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2012  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 113 million an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

the inflation rate for medical care costs has been higher than the inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

overview 

we are a diversified multiline healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to the rising number of underinsured and uninsured individuals we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach to managing our health plans including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

we operate in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or chip foster care medicare special needs plans and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd as of december 31 2011 medicaid accounted for 74 of our atrisk membership while chip also including foster care and abd also including medicare accounted for 12 and 12 respectively other state programs in massachusetts represent the remaining 2 atrisk membership our specialty services segment offers products for behavioral health care management software health insurance exchanges individual health insurance life and health management longterm care programs managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries our health plans in arizona operated by our longterm care company and massachusetts operated by our individual health insurance provider are included in the specialty services segment 

our atrisk managed care membership totaled 18 million as of december 31 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 our revenues and net earnings from continuing operations were 53 billion and 1084 million respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 2617 million 

  

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7700 forsyth boulevard st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

  

industry 

we provide our services to the uninsured primarily through medicaid chip foster care abd medicare and other state programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid and chip market was approximately 374 billion in 2009 and estimate the market will grow to 908 billion by 2020 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 73 in fiscal 2011 and states appropriated an increase of 22 for medicaid in fiscal 2012 budgets 

  

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs— one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don’t select a health plan we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

  

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs chip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

  

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 9 million dual eligible enrollees in 2011 these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our abd and longterm care programs and beginning in 2008 through medicare special needs plans 

  

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

  

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives additionally a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured estimated there were over 49 million americans in 2010 that lacked health insurance we expect that continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip foster care and abd populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

our business strategy 

  

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and underinsured population and state funded healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

  

 

 

 

 

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the company’s long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in georgia ohio and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2011 

  

  

medicaid managed care 

benefits to states 

  

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform assist and incentivize members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

providers 

  

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2011 the health plans we currently operate contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

 

 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

  

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservices per diems diagnostic related grouping and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

  

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health life and health management managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

  

quality management 

  

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

  

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa 

    

it is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members as a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote health care quality the ncqa health plan accreditation and urac health plan accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics while we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members 

  

specialty services 

  

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core medicaid managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

corporate compliance 

  

our corporate ethics and compliance program provides controls by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

  

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines and compliance program guidance series issued by the department of health and human services’ office of the inspector general or oig our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

 

 

  the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed yearly using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy compliance program description and various resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of our board of directors’ audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number and webbased reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the company to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other compliance violations furthermore the board of directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition 

  

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

  

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations  

  

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

  

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

  

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors — competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

  

regulation 

  

our medicaid medicare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations third party administrators utilization review andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid or medicare enrollees 

  

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

  

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

 

 

 

  

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

  

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of another person 

  

  

state contracts 

in addition to being a licensed health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

  

our state contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

 

a health plan or individual health insurance provider’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the terms of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions the contracts are subject to termination by the state for cause an event of default or lack of funding 

 

 

1 the current texas medicaid chip and abd contract expires on february 29 2012 the new texas medicaid chip  abd contract with expanded service areas commences march 1 2012 

 

  

  

hipaa and hitech 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual’s information among the main requirements of hipaa are the administrative simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the disclosre of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act which was enacted as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notification in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

 

the privacy and security rules and hitech enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates other requirements of the privacy regulations include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached in addition there is a patchwork of state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards are being modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system we are planning for an expected transition to icd10 in october 2013 

 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws contrary to hipaa to prevail if the secretary determines that 

 

 

 

 

 

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with both hipaa and hitech including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid the laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex changing and may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods while we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we have increased our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 5300 employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid chip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid chip and abd premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid chip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints although they were not included in the final budget there were budget proposals for 2012 that included federal cuts to medicaid funding ie through block grants and other means by as much as 1 trillion over 10 years 

states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid chip foster care and abd the current adverse economic conditions have and are expected to continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the medicaid eligible population increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies with whom we contract to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for current programs and program expansions contraction of covered benefits limited or no premium rate increases or premium decreases in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid chip foster care and abd costs and eligibility if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

in litigation that is pending before the us supreme court providers and beneficiaries have sued the state of california over reductions in reimbursement to the california medicaid program known as medical while we do not operate a health plan in california we cannot predict how the supreme court will rule in this case and the outcome of this litigation could have an impact on the amount of flexibility states have in reducing reimbursement 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted the acts permit states to expand medicaid to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level beginning april 1 2010 and requires this expansion by january 1 2014 additional federal funds will be provided to states in 2014 but the amount of the federal support decreases each year we cannot predict when the states will make these expansions further because the states have to pay for a portion of the care states may reduce our rates in order to afford the additional beneficiaries 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 and subsequent legislation provided additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and june 30 2011 during this time period the share of medicaid costs that were paid for by the federal government went up and each state’s share went down now that this additional funding has expired we cannot predict whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs 

changes to medicaid chip foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order to afford to maintain eligibility levels a number of states have requested waivers to the requirements to maintain eligibility levels and legislation has been introduced that would eliminate the requirement that eligibility levels be maintained we believe that reductions in medicaid chip foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

if we are unable to participate in chip programs our growth rate may be limited 

chip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in chip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

if chip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

federal support for chip has been authorized through 2019 with funding authorized through 2015 we cannot be certain that funding for chip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2015 thus we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their chip programs which have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have chip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid chip and abd we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire or renew between february 29 2012 and december 31 2016 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on april 12 2010 the wisconsin department of health services notified us that our wisconsin subsidiary was not awarded a southeast wisconsin badgercare plus managed care contract while we will continue to serve other regions of the state we transitioned the affected members to other plans by november 1 2010   further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis our business will suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

 

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

  

  

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues most states including but not limited to georgia indiana texas and wisconsin have implemented promptpayment laws and many states are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state and federal government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state and federal governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

• cancellation of our contracts 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid chip foster care and abd programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

  

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of data breach providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa and will have to expend additional time and financial resources to comply with the hipaa provisions contained in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009   and the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general 

the health care reform law and the implementation of that law could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted this legislation provides comprehensive changes to the us health care system which will be phased in at various stages through 2018 among other things by january 1 2014 states will be required to expand their medicaid programs to provide eligibility to nearly all people under age 65 with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty line as a result millions of lowincome adults without children who currently cannot qualify for coverage as well as many lowincome parents and in some instances children now covered through chip will be made eligible for medicaid states were permitted to begin such expansions on april 1 2010 

 

the legislation also imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 8 billion starting in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessment may not be deductible for income tax purposes if this federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if the cost of the federal premium tax is not included in the calculation of our rates or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new tax our results of operations financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

 

there are numerous outstanding steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level federal legislation has been introduced to permit states as early as 2014 as opposed to 2017 as is in the current health care reform law to opt out of the health care reform law and provide their own model in certain circumstances   because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities 

 

in addition there have been a number of lawsuits filed that challenge all or part of the health care reform law a number of the lawsuits have been ruled on by federal appeals courts and those rulings were not consistent several parties including the current administration have appealed to the us supreme court the supreme court has agreed to hear these cases but we cannot predict how it will rule various congressional leaders have indicated a desire to revisit some or all of the health care reform law while the us house of representatives voted to repeal the whole health care reform law the us senate voted against such a repeal and there have separately been a number of bills introduced that would repeal change or defund certain provisions of the law the 2011 budget eliminates two programs funded under the health care reform law – the consumer operated and oriented plan coop and the free choice voucher programs further a number of states have passed legislation intended to block various requirements of the health care reform law because of these challenges we cannot predict whether any or all of the legislation will be implemented as enacted overturned repealed or modified 

 

although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our business may be materially adversely affected 

 

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

  

  

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

changes in funding for medicaid may affect our business for example on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 23 2008 the united states district court for the district of columbia vacated the final rule as improperly promulgated on november 30 2010 cms issued final regulations that remove these provisions and restore the regulatory language that was in place before the 2007 regulations were issued while this rule has been removed we cannot predict whether another similar rule or any other rule that changes funding mechanisms will be promulgated and if any are  what impact they will have on our business 

  

legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and required states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs 

medicaid spending by the federal government could be decreased as part of the spending cuts associated with the recent increase of the debt ceiling 

in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 was enacted into law in order to increase the federal debt ceiling the law included spending cuts of nearly 1 trillion over 10 years but did not include any cuts to medicaid the law further created a congressional committee that was tasked with recommending a plan that would reduce the federal deficit by another 15 trillion over 10 years the committee was required to recommend a plan to congress by the end of november 2011 the committee was not able to come to agreement and recommend a plan to congress therefore automatic spending cuts will become effective while changes to medicaid could have been considered by the committee medicaid is not subject to the automatic spending cuts 

 

we cannot predict whether congress will take any action to change the automatic spending cuts further we cannot predict how states will react to any changes that occur at the federal level 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

  

while we utilize our predictive modeling technology and our executive dashboard we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted medical expense by 97 million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 2006 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for example we commenced operations in florida in february 2009 in massachusetts in july 2009 in mississippi in january 2011 in illinois in may 2011 in kentucky in november 2011 and expect to commence operations in louisiana in the first quarter of 2012 for a period of time after the inception of business in these states we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible for medicaid under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability and utilization patterns 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues profitability or cash flows 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to certain providers without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers’ completeness and quality of claims submission our processing of the claim submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states’ encounter systems and the states’ acceptance and analysis of the encounter data if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership our earnings will be affected negatively 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs or uncontrollable epidemic or pandemic costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in 2009 the h1n1 influenza pandemic resulted in heightened costs due to increased physician visits and increased utilization of hospital emergency rooms and pharmaceutical costs we cannot predict what impact an epidemic or pandemic will have on our costs in the future additionally we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

  

  

our investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2011 we had 7042 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 5330 million of longterm investments and restricted deposits we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which may include asset backed securities bank deposits commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury and other government corporations and agencies insurance contracts and equity securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition for example in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a loss on investments of approximately 45 million due to a loss in a money market fund 

our investments in state municipal and corporate securities are not guaranteed by the united states government which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation liquidity or financial condition 

as of december 31 2011 we had 5379 million of investments in state municipal and corporate securities these securities are not guaranteed by the united states government state and municipal securities are subject to additional credit risk based upon each local municipality’s tax revenues and financial stability as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate startup operations into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business for example effective july 2008 we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group inc the parent company of celtic insurance company or celtic celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families while we believed that the addition of celtic would be complementary to our business we had not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

  

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

business expansion costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover business expansion costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse affect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has been restricted such conditions may persist during 2012 and beyond in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses make payments on our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

  

  

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that if credit could be obtained the terms and costs of such credit could be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 

  

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our medicaid contract with kansas which terminated december 31 2006 together with our medicaid contract with missouri accounted for 3170 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal or rfp process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

  

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of health care reform and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs increases in the number of competitors and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

  

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates additionally the number of individuals eligible for medicaid managed care will likely increase as a result of the health care reform legislation we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal or state funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

  

  

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management for example we have in the past or may be subject to in the future securities class action lawsuits irs examinations or similar regulatory actions any such matters could harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 further expands the coverage of hipaa by among other things extending the privacy and security provisions requiring new disclosures if a data breach occurs mandating new regulations around electronic medical records expanding enforcement mechanisms allowing the state attorneys general to bring enforcement actions and increasing penalties for violations despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations

overview 

our financial performance for 2011 is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following items contributed to our revenue and membership growth over the last two years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect the following items to contribute to our future growth potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2010 we filed a legal challenge to the state of wisconsin’s decision on the southeast region reprocurement in september 2011 the wisconsin court of appeals denied our appeal 

as part of an rfp process the state of texas added a second vendor to the rural chip product in september 2010 which we previously managed under an exclusive contract as a result our december 31 2010 membership in this product decreased by approximately 50000 as compared to the prior year 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act or the acts were enacted in the united states the acts contain provisions we expect will have a significant effect on our business in coming years including expanding medicaid eligibility beginning in 2014 to recipients with incomes below 133 of the federal poverty level retaining the chip program in its current form and requiring statebased exchanges similar to our experience in massachusetts in the future the acts allow states to receive the same level of rebates from pharmaceutical companies for their medicaid programs whether or not the states participate in managed care the acts also impose an excise tax on health insurers beginning in 2014 based upon relative market share effective in 2011 minimum health benefit cost ratios became mandated for commercial fullyinsured major medical health plans in the individual market such as our celtic subsidiary the minimum health benefit cost ratio for these commercial plans will be set at 80 of premium revenue adjusted for certain taxes fees assessments risk premium and a credibility factor based upon both the number of covered life years and an average plan cost sharing adjustment calculated for each state certain states have filed and been granted waivers allowing for minimum heath benefit cost ratios at levels below 80 if the actual health benefit cost ratios do not meet the minimum calculated for any state rebates will be paid to those policyholders celtic expects to pay minimal rebates based on its 2011 results due to its complexity and lack of comprehensive interpretive guidance and implementation regulations the ultimate impact of the acts on celtic is not yet fully known the health benefit cost ratio minimum does not apply to other centene subsidiaries

results of continuing operations 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

summarized comparative financial data for 2011 2010 and 2009 are as follows  in millions 

 

  

  

overview 

revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s membership some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 

revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data these eligibility adjustments are reflected in the period known we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments which could be significant to these estimates 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider and hospital passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 

the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis 

  

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

during 2011 we reclassified certain medical costs and general  administrative expenses to more closely align with the new national association of insurance commissioners naic definitions of medical costs we have reclassified all periods presented to conform to the new presentation the table below presents the impact of the reclassification on consolidated medical costs and hbr for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager’s external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

as mentioned above during 2011 we reclassified certain medical costs and ga expenses to more closely align with the new naic definitions we have reclassified all periods presented to conform to the new presentation of medical costs the table below presents the impact of the reclassification on consolidated ga expense and the ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

other income expense 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of uhp our new jersey health plan accordingly the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented we completed the sale in the first quarter of 2010 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 209 in 2011 over 2010 as a result of membership growth discussed under the heading “membership” the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments in 2011 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 09 composite decrease across all of our markets 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

  

the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

  

the consolidated hbr of 852 for 2011 represented a 03 decrease from the 2010 consolidated hbr of 855 the decrease is primarily due to lower levels of utilization and contract enhancements 

  

general and administrative expenses 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 113 and 112 respectively the increase in the ratio in 2011 primarily reflects increased business expansion costs to support new business in illinois kentucky louisiana and texas partially offset by the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 

investment and other income net 

 

 

investment income the decrease in investment income in 2011 reflects the continued low market interest rates partially offset by an increase in investment balances 

net gain on sale of investments as a result of tightening our investment criteria for municipal securities we sold municipal securities resulting in net gains of 25 million during 2010 

impairment of investment during 2010 we determined we had an otherthantemporary impairment of our cost method investment in casenet llc and recorded an impairment charge of 55 million 

gain on reserve primary fund distributions in 2010 we received distributions from the reserve primary fund of 57 million resulting in a gain of 33 million recorded for the distributions received in excess of our adjusted basis 

debt extinguishment costs in may 2011 the company redeemed its 1750 million 725 senior notes due april 1 2014 at 103625 and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs debt extinguishment costs totaled 85 million or 010 per diluted share 

interest expense interest expense for 2011 increased by 23 million from 2010 primarily due to borrowings on the mortgage loan associated with the real estate development including our corporate headquarters the real estate development was placed in service in the third quarter of 2010 and accordingly we ceased capitalizing interest on the project the increase in interest expense was partially offset by reduced interest expense reflecting the refinancing our senior notes and lower interest rate as a result of the execution of the associated interest rate swap agreements in 2011 

income tax expense 

 

excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate in 2011 was 374 compared to 397 in 2010 the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a higher rate in 2010 resulting from legislation enacted in may 2010 in the state of georgia which replaced the state income tax with a premium tax for medicaid managed care organizations effective july 1 2010 accordingly a deferred tax asset of 17 million related to georgia state net operating loss carry forwards was written off during 2010 additionally the higher effective tax rate in 2010 was also related to a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in state income taxes 

  

  

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment  in millions 

 

  

medicaid managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 207 in 2011 due to the addition of the mississippi illinois and kentucky contracts the texas market expansion and overall membership growth earnings from operations increased 306 in 2011 reflecting overall growth in our membership reduced hbr and leveraging of our general and administrative expenses 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 335 in 2011 primarily due to the growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership earnings from operations decreased 66 in 2011 reflecting the addition of the care management software business which operates at a loss and lower earnings in our individual health insurance business 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 105 in 2010 over 2009 as a result of membership growth discussed under the heading “membership” and net premium rate increases in 2010 in 2010 we received premium rate adjustments in certain markets which yielded a net 23 composite increase across all of our markets the increase in premium and service revenues was moderated by the removal of pharmacy services in two states in 2010 these pharmacy carve outs had the effect of reducing revenue by approximately 1850 million during 2010 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

  

the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

  

  

the consolidated hbr of 855 for 2010 represented a 02 increase from the 2009 consolidated hbr of 853 the increase is mainly due to a member mix shift to less favorable hbr categories partially offset by provider network and utilization management initiatives 

general and administrative expenses 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 was 112 and 115 respectively the decrease in the ratio in 2010 primarily reflects the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 

investment and other income net 

 

 

  

investment income the decrease in investment income in 2010 reflects the decline in market interest rates 

net gain on sale of investments as a result of tightening our investment criteria for municipal securities we sold municipal securities resulting in net gains of 25 million during 2010 

impairment of investment during 2010 we determined we had an otherthantemporary impairment of our cost method investment in casenet llc and recorded an impairment charge of 55 million including 35 million of convertible promissory notes 

gain on reserve primary fund distributions in 2010 we received distributions from the reserve primary fund of 57 million resulting in a gain of 33 million recorded for the distributions received in excess of our adjusted basis 

interest expense interest expense increased reflecting the borrowings on the loans associated with the construction of our corporate headquarters the real estate development was placed in service in the third quarter 2010 and accordingly we ceased capitalizing interest on the project the increase was partially offset by the reduction in debt outstanding under our revolving credit agreement as a result of the equity offering completed during the first quarter of 2010 

  

  

income tax expense 

 

excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate in 2010 was 397 compared to 362 in 2009 the increase in 2010 was primarily driven by legislation enacted in may 2010 in the state of georgia which replaced the state income tax with a premium tax for medicaid managed care organizations effective july 1 2010 accordingly a deferred tax asset of 17 million related to georgia state net operating loss carry forwards was written off during 2010 additionally the increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was also related to a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in state income taxes 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings related to discontinued operations consisting solely of the new jersey health plan operations were 83 million in 2010 compared to a pretax loss of 36 million in 2009 as a result of the sale of certain assets of the new jersey operations in march 2010 we recognized a pretax gain of 82 million which was 39 million after tax or 008 per diluted share additionally we recognized 12 million of restructuring costs associated with the exit primarily due to lease termination costs and employee retention programs the total revenue associated with uhp included in results from discontinued operations was 218 million and 1451 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment  in millions 

 

medicaid managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 80 in 2010 due to membership growth and net premium rate increases in 2010 earnings from operations increased 179 in 2010 reflecting overall growth in our membership and leveraging of our general and administrative expenses 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 60 in 2010 primarily due to growth of our operations in massachusetts as well as membership growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership earnings from operations increased 29 in 2010 reflecting the growth in service revenue for lower margin services higher hbr in 2010 and the effect of pharmacy carve outs in two states 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

  

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 that we use throughout our discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 

  

 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility operating activities provided cash of 2617 million in 2011 compared to 1689 million in 2010 and 2482 million in 2009 

cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we receive from our states states may prepay the following month premium payment which we record as unearned revenue or they may delay our premium payment by several days until the following month which we record as a receivable 

the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states  in millions 

 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was negatively impacted by the timing of payments from our states by 1204 million as of december 31 2011 we had received all december 2011 capitation payments from our states and had not received any prepayments of january 2012 capitation this was offset by an increase in medical claims liabilities related to the start up of our mississippi illinois and kentucky health plans as well as expansion of our texas health plan in 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities benefited in 2010 and 2009 as a result of prepayments from several of our states cash flows from operations in 2010 also reflected an increase in premium and related receivables and medical claims liability primarily due to increased business in florida massachusetts and south carolina 

  cash flows used in investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 1291 million in 2011 2106 million in 2010 and 2701 million in 2009 cash flows for each year primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to longterm investments and capital expenditures in 2009 cash flows from investing activities also included membership conversion fees in florida and acquisitions in florida and south carolina 

  

our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2011 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 20 years these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity recent trading activity in similar securities and other observable inputs our investment guidelines comply with the regulatory restrictions enacted in each state 

  

  

the following table summarizes our cash and investment balances as of december 31  in millions 

 

 

we spent 644 million 317 million and 232 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively on capital expenditures for system enhancements a new datacenter and market expansions we also spent 46 million 316 million and 05 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively for costs associated with our headquarters development including land tenant improvements and furniture we anticipate spending approximately 55 million on capital expenditures in 2012 primarily associated with system enhancements and market expansions 

during 2009 we executed an agreement as a joint venture partner in centene center llc that began construction of a real estate development that included the company’s corporate headquarters during 2010 the development was placed in service and we acquired the remaining ownership interest in centene center llc for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 centene center llc had capital expenditures of 47 million 553 million and 594 million respectively for costs associated with the real estate development we anticipate spending approximately 3 million on capital expenditures in 2012 associated with the real estate development 

cash flows provided by financing activities 

our financing activities provided cash of 69 million in 2011 721 million in 2010 and 466 million in 2009 during 2011 our financing activities primarily related to repayments and proceeds of long term debt as discussed below during 2010 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from our stock offering and resulting payoff of our revolving credit facility discussed below as well as borrowings for the construction of the real estate development discussed above during 2009 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our 300 million credit facility and construction financing of the real estate development discussed above 

in june 2009 centene center llc executed a 95 million construction loan associated with the real estate development that included our corporate headquarters in december 2010 we refinanced the 95 million construction loan with an 80 million 10 year mortgage note payable the mortgage note is nonrecourse to the company bears a 514 interest rate and has a financial covenant requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio 

during the first quarter of 2010 we completed the sale of 575 million shares of common stock for 1925 per share net proceeds from the sale of the shares were approximately 1045 million a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our 300 million revolving credit loan facility 840 million as of december 31 2009 the remaining net proceeds were used to fund our acquisition in south carolina as well as capital expenditures 

in january 2011 we replaced our 300 million revolving credit agreement with a new 350 million revolving credit facility or the revolver the revolver is unsecured and has a fiveyear maturity with nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum net worth borrowings under the revolver will bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from 025 to 050 depending on the total debt to ebitda ratio as of december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under the agreement leaving availability of 3500 million as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants 

in may 2011 we exercised our option to redeem the 175 million 725 senior notes due april 1 2014 175 million notes we redeemed the 175 million notes at 103625 and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs resulting in a pretax expense of 85 million 

in may 2011 pursuant to a shelf registration statement we issued 250 million of noncallable 575 senior notes due june 1 2017 250 million notes at a discount to yield 6 the indenture governing the 250 million notes contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio interest is paid semiannually in june and december we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the 175 million notes and call premium and to repay approximately 50 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility the additional proceeds were used for general corporate purposes in connection with the issuance we entered into 250 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements swap agreements that are scheduled to expire june 1 2017 under the swap agreements we receive a fixed rate of 575 and pay a variable rate of libor plus 35 adjusted quarterly which allows us to adjust the 250 million notes to a floating rate we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 

at december 31 2011 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 1024 million as compared to 1084 million at december 31 2010 we manage our shortterm and longterm investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm requirements as needed our working capital is negative from time to time due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm 

at december 31 2011 our debt to capital ratio defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity was 273 compared to 293 at december 31 2010 excluding the 778 million nonrecourse mortgage note our debt to capital ratio is 226 we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure among others of our leverage and financial flexibility 

we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions no duration has been placed on the repurchase program we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2011 or 2010 

during the year ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we received dividends of 691 million 679 million 191 million respectively from our regulated subsidiaries 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

  

 

 

1 includes 7868 separate account liabilities from third party reinsurance that will not be settled in cash 

  

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2011 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 6199 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 3420 million and we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2011 each of our health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financials statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors – failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2011 data 

 

 

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 38 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

  

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 

  

 

 

1 days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 

  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2011 will be known by the end of 2012 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member’s acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2011 we had 2820 million of goodwill and 274 million of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 

 

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had shortterm investments of 1305 million and longterm investments of 5330 million including restricted deposits of 268 million the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us treasury securities government sponsored obligations life insurance contracts asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our availableforsale investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2011 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 108 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

we entered into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements convert a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments as a result the fair value of our 250 million senior note debt varies with market interest rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2011 the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 123 million an increase in interest rates decreases the fair value of the debt and conversely a decrease in interest rates increases the value 

for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

in 2011 the inflation rate for medical care costs was higher than the inflation rate for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

we provide our services to the uninsured primarily through medicaid chip foster care abd medicare and other state programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid and chip market was approximately 355 billion in 2008 and estimate the market will grow to 896 billion by 2019 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 88 in fiscal 2010 and states appropriated an increase of 74 for medicaid in fiscal 2011 budgets 

  

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs— one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don’t select a health plan we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 

  

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs chip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

  

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 9 million dual eligible enrollees in 2010 these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our abd and longterm care programs and beginning in 2008 through special needs plans 

  

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

  

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives additionally a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured estimated there were over 46 million americans in 2008 that lacked health insurance we expect that continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip foster care and abd populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

our business strategy 

  

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and under insured population and state funded healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

  

 

 

 

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories and all of the company’s long lived assets are based in the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year our managed care subsidiaries in georgia ohio and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2010 other financial information about our segments is found in note 20 segment information  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

medicaid managed care 

benefits to states 

  

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

 

  

  

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

providers 

  

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2010 the health plans we currently operate contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

 

  

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

  

  

  

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservices per diems diagnostic related groups and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement 

 

 

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

  

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health life and health management managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

  

quality management 

  

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

  

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

 

information technology 

  

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions we continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

our predictive modeling technology enables the medical management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members it can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines interventions are determined by the clinical indicators the ability to improve health outcomes and the risk profile of members 

our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided under the business resumption plan 

    

  

  

specialty services 

  

our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core medicaid managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate compliance 

  

our corporate ethics and compliance program was established in 1998 and provides controls by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

  

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance which is assessed yearly using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization our internal corporate compliance intranet site accessible to all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy code of conduct compliance program description and various resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions if needed employees have access to the contact information for the members of the audit committee to report concerns our ethics and compliance helpline is a tollfree number operated by a third party independent of the company to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other compliance violations the board of directors reviews an ethics compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition 

  

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

  

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations  

  

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

  

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

  

  

  

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors — competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

  

regulation 

  

our medicaid medicare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

  

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

  

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

 

 

 

we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and hmo subsidiaries are domiciled these acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or hmo and its affiliates these holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and hmos within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations in addition various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system depending on the size and nature of the transactions some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies hmos their parent holding companies and affiliates among other provisions state insurance and hmo laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

  

additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company “control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of another person 

state contracts 

in addition to being a licensed health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

  

our state contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

 

a health plan or individual health insurance provider’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

  

  

  

the table below sets forth the term of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions as of december 31 2010 the contracts are subject to termination by the state for cause an event of default or lack of funding 

 

1 the texas medicaid chip and abd contract is currently subject to renewal under the state’s reprocurement process effective march 1 2012 

 

hipaa and hitech 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual’s information among the main requirements of hipaa are the “administrative simplification” provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act which was enacted as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandated individual notification in instances of data breach provided enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granted enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

 

the privacy and security rules and hitech enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of personal health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted the hitech act established a federal requirement for notification when the security of personal health information is breached in addition there is a patchwork of states laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements the transaction standards are being modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the icd10 coding system 

  

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with both hipaa and hitech including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach we provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to personal health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources we are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 4200 employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

 

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid chip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid chip and abd premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid chip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 

states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid chip foster care and abd the current adverse economic conditions have and are expected to continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the medicaid eligible population increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies with whom we contract to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for current programs and program expansions contraction of covered benefits limited or no premium rate increases or premium decreases in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid chip foster care and abd costs and eligibility if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

  

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted the acts permit states to expand medicaid to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level beginning april 1 2010 and requires this expansion by january 1 2014 additional federal funds will be provided to states in 2014 but the amount of the federal support decreases each year we cannot predict when the states will make these expansions further because the states have to pay for a portion of the care states may reduce our rates in order to afford the additional beneficiaries 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down on august 10 2010 a sixmonth extension of the enhanced match funding law was signed such that the enhanced match at a reduced level will continue until june 30 2011 we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs 

  

changes to medicaid chip foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order to afford to maintain eligibility levels we believe that reductions in medicaid chip foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

if we are unable to participate in chip programs our growth rate may be limited 

chip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in chip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

 

if chip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

  federal support for chip has been authorized through 2019 with funding authorized through 2015  we cannot be certain that funding for chip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2015 thus we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their chip programs which have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have chip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid chip and abd we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire or renew between june 30 2011 and december 31 2014 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on april 12 2010 the wisconsin department of health services notified us that our wisconsin subsidiary was not awarded a southeast wisconsin badgercare plus managed care contract while we will continue to serve other regions of the state we transitioned the affected members to other plans by november 1 2010   further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis our business will suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

  

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

  

  

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues most states including but not limited to georgia indiana texas and wisconsin have implemented promptpayment laws and many states are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

  

• cancellation of our contracts 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services and 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid chip foster care and abd programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of data breach providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

  

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa and will have to expend additional time and financial resources to comply with the hipaa provisions contained in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009   and the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act  we cann ot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage for example some states including indiana and ohio have removed and others could consider removing pharmacy coverage from the services covered by managed care entities we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general 

the recently enacted health care reform law and the implementation of that law could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted this legislation provides comprehensive changes to the us health care system which will be phased in at various stages over the next eight years among other things by january 1 2014 states will be required to expand their medicaid programs to provide eligibility to nearly all people under age 65 with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty line as a result millions of lowincome adults without children who currently cannot qualify for coverage as well as many lowincome parents and in some instances children now covered through chip will be made eligible for medicaid states were permitted to begin such expansions on april 1 2010 

 

the legislation also imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of 8 billion starting in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter such assessment may not be deductible for income tax purposes if this federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if the cost of the federal premium tax is not included in the calculation of our rates or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new tax our results of operations financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

 

there are numerous outstanding steps required to implement the legislation including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities 

 

in addition there have been a number of lawsuits filed that challenge all or part of the health care reform law on january 31 2011 a florida district court ruled that the entire health care reform law is unconstitutional other courts have ruled in favor of the law or have only struck down certain provisions of the law these cases are under appeal and others are in process we can not predict the ultimate outcome of any of the litigation further various congressional leaders have indicated a desire to revisit some or all of the health care reform law during 2011 while the us house of representatives voted to repeal the whole health care reform law the us senate voted against such a repeal and there have separately been a number of bills introduced that would repeal or change certain provisions of the law because of these challenges we cannot predict whether any or all of the legislation will be implemented as enacted overturned repealed or modified 

 

although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business the enacted reforms as well as future regulations and legislative changes may in fact have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our business may be materially adversely affected 

 

  

  

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

changes in funding for medicaid may affect our business for example on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 23 2008 the united states district court for the district of columbia vacated the final rule as improperly promulgated   on november 30 2010 cms issued final regulations that remove these provisions and restore the regulatory language that was in place before the 2007 regulations were issued while this rule has been removed we cannot predict whether another similar rule or any other rule that changes funding mechanisms will be promulgated and if any are  what impact they will have on our business 

 

legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs 

 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

  

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

  

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

we can not be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted ibnr by 97 million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 2006 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for example we commenced operations in south carolina in december 2007 began our foster care program in texas in april 2008 commenced operations in florida in february 2009 in massachusetts in july 2009 in mississippi in january 2011 and expect to commence operations in illinois in 2011 for a period of time after the inception of business in these states we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible for medicaid under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability and utilization patterns 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues profitability or cash flows 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted 

in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers’ completeness and quality of claims submission our processing of the claim submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states’ encounter systems and the states’ acceptance and analysis of the encounter data if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership our earnings will be affected negatively 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs or uncontrollable epidemic or pandemic costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in 2009 the h1n1 influenza pandemic resulted in heightened costs due to increased physician visits and increased utilization of hospital emergency rooms and pharmaceutical costs we cannot predict what impact the h1n1 influenza virus or any other epidemic or pandemic will have on our costs in the future additionally we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

  

  

our investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2010 we had 4553 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 6186 million of longterm investments and restricted deposits we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which may include asset backed securities bank deposits commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury and other government corporations and agencies insurance contracts and equity securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition for example in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a loss on investments of approximately 45 million due to a loss in a money market fund 

our investments in state municipal and corporate securities are not guaranteed by the united states government which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation liquidity or financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 we had 5563 million of investments in state municipal and corporate securities these securities are not guaranteed by the united states government state and municipal securities are subject to additional credit risk based upon each local municipality’s tax revenues and financial stability as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

  

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan and 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business for example effective july 2008 we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group inc the parent company of celtic insurance company or celtic celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families while we believed that the addition of celtic would be complementary to our business we had not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

  

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

business expansion costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover business expansion costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

  

  

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse affect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has been restricted such conditions may persist during 2011 and beyond in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses make payments on our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that if credit could be obtained the terms and costs of such credit could be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our medicaid contract with kansas which terminated december 31 2006 together with our medicaid contract with missouri accounted for 3170 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal or rfp process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition the impact of health care reform and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs increases in the number of competitors and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

  

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

  

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

  

  

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates additionally the number of individuals eligible for medicaid managed care will likely increase as a result of the recent health care reform legislation we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal or state funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

  

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management for example we have in the past or may be subject to in the future securities class action lawsuits irs examinations or similar regulatory actions any such matters could harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 further expands the coverage of hipaa by among other things extending the privacy and security provisions requiring new disclosures if a data breach occurs mandating new regulations around electronic medical records expanding enforcement mechanisms allowing the state attorneys general to bring enforcement actions and increasing penalties for violations despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own both of our corporate office headquarters buildings located in st louis missouri during 2008 2009 and 2010 our capital expenditures included costs for the construction of a new real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business 

we generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2008 the internal revenue services began an audit of the company’s 2006 and 2007 tax returns in connection with the irs examination the field agent initially denied the 349 million tax benefit related to the abandonment of the firstguard stock in 2007 based on certain assumptions of fact by the irs the most significant change was to recharacterize the loss as a capital loss versus an ordinary loss 

in connection with an appeals conference in august 2010 the company responded to the field agents original writeup and provided additional documentation to the appeals officer to support the companys view that sufficient technical tax authority existed at the time of the firstguard abandonment to support the companys tax position the company is proceeding with the appeals process and believes that once the factual issues surrounding the abandonment are understood by the irs the position more likely than not will be upheld 

we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain we do not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview 

our financial performance for 2010 is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we completed the sale of university health plans inc or uhp our new jersey health plan in the first quarter of 2010 unless specifically noted all discussions are in the context of continuing operations and therefore exclude uhp the results of operations for uhp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

the following items contributed to our revenue and membership growth over the last two years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect the following items to contribute to our future growth potential 

 

 

 

 

as part of an rfp process the state of texas added a second vendor to the rural chip product in september 2010 which we previously managed under an exclusive contract as a result our december 31 2010 membership in this product decreased by approximately 50000 as compared to the prior year 

in april 2010 we were notified by the wisconsin department of health services that our wisconsin subsidiary managed health services mhs was not awarded a southeast wisconsin badgercare plus managed care contract the change was effective november 1 2010 after a twomonth transition period september through october mhs no longer serves badgercare plus standard and benchmark members in milwaukee washington ozaukee waukesha and kenosha counties mhs continues to serve wisconsin core plan and abd members in this region as well as members in other regions of the state in 2010 we filed a legal challenge to the state of wisconsins decision on the southeast region reprocurement the lawsuit is currently pending before the wisconsin court of appeals the timing and outcome of any decision from the appellate court is unknown at this time 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act or the acts were enacted in the united states the acts contain provisions we expect will have a significant effect on our business in coming years including expanding medicaid eligibility beginning in 2014 to recipients with incomes below 133 of the federal poverty level retaining the chip program in its current form and requiring statebased exchanges similar to our experience in massachusetts in the future the acts allow states to receive the same level of rebates from pharmaceutical companies for their medicaid programs whether or not the states participate in managed care the acts also impose an excise tax on health insurers beginning in 2014 based upon relative market share effective in 2011 minimum health benefit cost ratios will be mandated for commercial fullyinsured major medical health plans in the individual market like our celtic subsidiary the minimum health benefit cost ratio for these commercial plans will be set at 80 of premium revenue adjusted for certain taxes fees assessments risk premium and a credibility factor based upon both the number of covered life years and an average plan cost sharing adjustment calculated for each state if the actual health benefit cost ratios do not meet the minimum calculated for any state rebates will be paid to those policyholders due to its complexity and lack of comprehensive interpretive guidance and implementing regulations the full impact of the acts on celtic is not yet fully known the health benefit cost ratio minimum does not apply to other centene subsidiaries

results of continuing operations 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

summarized comparative financial data for 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows  in millions 

 

  

  

  

overview 

revenues and revenue recognition 

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s membership some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

  

our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses in 2009 one of the states in which we operate increased their premium which was required to be passed through to hospitals in the state for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 this passthrough totaled 842 million and 1329 million we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we can not assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager’s external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 

other income expense 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of uhp our new jersey health plan accordingly the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented we completed the sale in the first quarter of 2010 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 105 in 2010 over 2009 as a result of membership growth discussed under the heading “membership” and net premium rate increases in 2010 the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments in 2010 we received premium rate adjustments in certain markets which yielded a net 23 composite increase across all of our markets the increase in premium and service revenues was moderated by the removal of pharmacy services in two states in 2010 these pharmacy carve outs had the effect of reducing revenue by approximately 1850 million during 2010

medical costs 

  

the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

  

the consolidated hbr of 838 for 2010 represented a 03 increase from the 2009 consolidated hbr of 835 the increase is mainly due to our florida and texas health plans and is partially offset by improvements from our georgia health plan the impact from our florida health plan is due to the higher hbr we have experienced in this market combined with the growth in membership and revenue from 2009 to 2010 the texas health plan performance was impacted in 2010 as member mix shifted to less favorable hbr categories the improvements from the georgia health plan are due to provider network and utilization management initiatives 

general and administrative expenses 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 was 128 and 133 respectively the decrease in the ratio in 2010 primarily reflects the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues partially offset by an increase in contributions to our charitable foundation as well as increased business expansion costs 

  

investment and other income net 

 

the following table summarizes the components of investment and other income net  in millions 

 

the decrease in investment income in 2010 reflects the decline in market interest rates 

in september 2010 we determined we had an otherthantemporary impairment of our investment in casenet llc a company that provides software to automate the clinical administrative and technical components of care management programs as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 5531 including 3531 of convertible promissory notes   additionally we are a customer of casenet llc and in december 2010 we purchased an additional investment interest in exchange for majority control of casenet llc 

as a result of tightening our investment criteria for municipal securities we sold municipal securities resulting in net gains of 25 million during 2010 also in 2010 we received distributions from the reserve primary fund of 57 million resulting in a gain of 33 recorded for the distributions received in excess of our adjusted basis 

interest expense increased reflecting the borrowings on the loans associated with the construction of our corporate headquarters the real estate development was placed in service in the third quarter 2010 and accordingly we ceased capitalizing interest on the project the increase was partially offset by the reduction in debt outstanding under our revolving credit agreement as a result of the equity offering completed during the first quarter of 2010 

income tax expense 

 

excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate in 2010 was 397 compared to 362 in 2009 the increase in 2010 was primarily driven by legislation enacted in may 2010 in the state of georgia which replaced the state income tax with a premium tax for medicaid managed care organizations effective july 1 2010 accordingly a deferred tax asset of 17 million related to georgia state net operating loss carry forwards was written off during the second quarter additionally the increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was also related to a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in state income taxes 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings related to discontinued operations consisting solely of the new jersey health plan operations were 83 million in 2010 compared to a pretax loss of 36 million in 2009 as a result of the sale of certain assets of the new jersey operations in march 2010 we recognized a pretax gain of 82 million which was 39 million after tax or 008 per diluted share additionally we recognized 12 million of restructuring costs associated with the exit primarily due to lease termination costs and employee retention programs the total revenue associated with uhp included in results from discontinued operations was 218 million and 1451 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively uhp had remaining statutory capital of approximately 25 million at december 31 2010 which will be transferred to unregulated cash as operations winddown subject to regulatory approval 

  

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment  in millions 

 

  

  

  

medicaid managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 80 in 2010 due to membership growth and net premium rate increases in 2010 earnings from operations increased 179 in 2010 reflecting overall growth in our membership and leveraging of our general and administrative expenses 

  

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 60 in 2010 primarily due to growth of our operations in massachusetts as well as membership growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership earnings from operations increased 29 in 2010 reflecting the growth in service revenue for lower margin services higher hbr in 2010 and the effect of pharmacy carve outs in two states 

  

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenues 

  

premium and service revenues increased 184 in 2009 over 2008 as a result of membership growth in all our states discussed under the heading “membership” the effect of a full year of the celtic acquisition in july 2008 and premium rate increases the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments in 2009 we received premium rate increases in certain markets which yielded a 29 composite increase across all of our markets 

in november 2007 we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia effective july 1 2007 the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january 2008 and accordingly we recorded the additional revenue retroactive to july 1 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 the premium revenue related to the period from july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 totals approximately 208 million 

contract amendments related to rate increases for the georgia health plan effective july 1 2009 and july 1 2010 were not fully executed until the respective fourth quarters and accordingly the premium revenue from july 1 to september 30 was recorded in the fourth quarter in each respective year 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category 

  

 

  

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2009 was 835 an increase of 10 over 2008 the increase in the total hbr in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to the effect of the following items 

 

 

 

 

these factors were partially offset by reductions in the hbr for our abd product particularly due to provider network improvements and exiting certain markets in ohio and growth in our south carolina abd membership which operates at a lower hbr than our normal range the decrease in our abd hbr lowered our total hbr by 17 for the year ended december 31 2009 

general and administrative expenses 

the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was 133 and 136 respectively the decrease in the ratio in 2009 primarily reflects the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of celtic our business expansion costs for florida massachusetts and mississippi and the consolidation of access 

investment and other income net 

 

 

decreases in investment income in 2009 reflect the decline in market interest rates 

the 2008 results included a loss of 45 million related to our investment in the reserve primary money market fund whose net asset value fell below 100 per share 

earnings from equity method investee decreased due to the inclusion of investment in access as a consolidated subsidiary beginning in 2009 interest expense was relatively stable reflecting modest increases in debt balances offset by the decline in market interest rates associated with variable rate debt 

  

  

income tax expense 

 

excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate in 2009 was 362 compared to 384 in 2008 the decrease in 2009 was primarily related to an increase in 2008 due to a change in the estimated benefit to be realized from new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 

discontinued operations 

the pretax loss from discontinued operations was 36 million in 2009 and 10 million in 2008 legal expenses of 18 million and employee retention expenses of 36 million related to the pending sale of uhp were included in the results from discontinued operations during 2009 the 2008 results include a onetime charge of 37 million primarily for asset impairments and employee severance related to the sale

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment  in millions 

 

  

medicaid managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 158 in 2009 due to membership growth in our states especially florida indiana south carolina and texas earnings from operations decreased in 2009 from 2008 levels due to the aforementioned effect of the georgia rate increase excluding the effects of recording this rate increase in 2008 earnings from operations increased 134 in 2009 over 2008 levels reflecting the overall growth in our membership and revenue base and improvements in our abd product especially in ohio and south carolina this increase was partially offset by a rate decrease in texas higher medical costs related to the flu and a higher hbr in florida 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 285 in 2009 primarily due to a full year effect of the celtic acquisition the commencement of our new health plan in massachusetts and membership growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership earnings from operations increased 674 in 2009 from 2008 levels primarily due to the increase in revenue and leveraging of the segments infrastructure costs over this higher revenue base earnings from operations also increased due to a lower hbr

during the year ended december 31 2010 we received dividends of 679 million from our regulated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31 2009 we received dividends of 191 million from our regulated subsidiaries on july 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of celtic for a purchase price of approximately 820 million net of unregulated cash acquired during the year ended december 31 2008 the company received a dividend from celtic of 314 million concurrent with the acquisition and received an additional dividend of 170 million from a regulated subsidiary 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

  

 

 

  

  

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2010 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 5161 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 3080 million and we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2010 each of our health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

for this information refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financials statements included herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors – failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2010 data 

 

 

  

  

  

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 28 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 

  

 

  

the acquisition in 2008 includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of celtic 

  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2010 will be known by the end of 2011 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member’s acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2010 we had 2781 million of goodwill and 291 million of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 

 

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had shortterm investments of 213 million and longterm investments of 6186 million including restricted deposits of 228 million the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts us treasury investments asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2010 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 112 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

while the inflation rate in 2010 for medical care costs was slightly less than that for all items historically inflation for medical care costs has generally exceeded that for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services additionally our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or chip foster care medicare special needs plans and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd our health plans in florida georgia indiana ohio south carolina texas and wisconsin are included in the medicaid managed care segment as of december 31 2009 medicaid accounted for 74 of our atrisk membership while chip also including foster care and abd also including medicare accounted for 18 and 6 respectively other state programs in massachusetts represent the remaining 2 atrisk membership our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health individual health insurance life and health management longterm care programs managed vision telehealth services and pharmacy benefits management to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries our health plans in arizona which is operated by our longterm care company and massachusetts which is operated by our individual health insurance provider are included in the specialty services segment our specialty services segment also provides a full range of healthcare solutions for the rising number of uninsured americans 

we expect to complete the sale of certain assets of university health plans inc or uhp our new jersey health plan during the first quarter of 2010 this sale is discussed in detail under the caption “discontinued operations” under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” accordingly our new jersey health plan operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 

our atrisk managed care membership totaled approximately 15 million as of december 31 2009 for the year ended december 31 2009 our revenues and net earnings from continuing operations were 41 billion and 861 million respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 2482 million 

in november 2009 the mississippi division of medicaid selected centene as one of two organizations to participate in the mississippi coordinated access network a program for mississippi medicaid beneficiaries we are continuing to work with mississippi to execute a contract in which we will serve eligible members throughout the state as magnolia health plan and expect to execute the contract and begin managing care for abd members in mississippi in 2010 

  

we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services we believe our local approach to managing our health plans including provider and member services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

  

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7711 carondelet avenue st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

  

industry 

we provide our services to the uninsured primarily through medicaid chip foster care abd medicare and other state programs for the uninsured the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 329 billion in 2007 and estimate the market will grow to 800 billion by 2018 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 79 in fiscal 2009 and states appropriated an increase of 63 for medicaid in fiscal 2010 budgets 

  

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs— one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don’t select a health plan we refer to these states as mandated managed care states eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

  

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 created chip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their chip programs chip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

  

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured there were approximately 88 million dual eligible enrollees in 2009 these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our abd and longterm care programs and beginning in 2008 through special needs plans 

  

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

  

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives additionally a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured estimated there were over 46 million americans in 2008 that lacked health insurance we expect that continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid chip foster care and abd populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 



 

 

 









  

our business strategy 

  

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured population and state funded healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

  













  

 

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 









all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of each year our managed care subsidiaries in georgia ohio and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 other financial information about our segments is found in note 21 segment information  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

medicaid managed care 

benefits to states 

  

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 





















  

 

  

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assists members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 



we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

  





 











  

providers 

  

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2009 the health plans we currently operate contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 



 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

  

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay hospitals under a variety of methods including feeforservices per diems diagnostic related groups and case rates we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement 









we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

  

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 













our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the memberconnections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the memberconnections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health health management managed vision telehealth services pharmacy benefit management and treatment compliance when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

  

quality management 

  

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 













we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

  

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

  

 

  

information technology 

  

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions we continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

our predictive modeling technology enables the medical management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members it can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines interventions are determined by the clinical indicators the ability to improve health outcomes and the risk profile of members 

our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided under the business resumption plan 

    

specialty companies 

  

our specialty companies are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core medicaid managed care business specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 



 









 

 





corporate compliance 

  

our corporate ethics and compliance program was first established in 1998 and provides methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

  

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 















  

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations the audit committee and the board of directors review a compliance report on a quarterly basis 

  

competition 

  

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

  

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations  

  







we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

  

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 

  

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors — competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

 

regulation 

  

our medicaid medicare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

  

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements or other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

  

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 









state contracts 

in addition to being a licensed health maintenance organization in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

  

our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 



a health plan or individual health insurance providers’ compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

 

the table below sets forth the term of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions as of december 31 2009 



 

1 the arizona behavioral health contract renewal is currently in process under the state’s reprocurement process 

2 the indiana medicaid and chip contract is subject to a reprocurement process with a contract effective date of january 1 2011 

3 the texas chip rural service area rsa contract covers chip members previously included under the exclusive provider organization epo contract the chip rsa contract has a start date of september 1 2010 under the previous epo contract we were the sole provider of services under the new rsa contract members have the option to select either our plan or the new alternate plan provided by another carrier 

4 the current contract excludes coverage for medicaid and chip members in six counties kenosha milwaukee ozaukee racine washington and waukesha the state has not yet determined the process for renewal and if it will require requalification or a complete reprocurement submission 

5 the contract covers six counties carved out by the state for medicaid and chip members kenosha milwaukee ozaukee racine washington and waukesha this contract extension is in place to cover members in these counties until the later of july 31 2010 or at a date which the state has awarded membership under the reprocurement currently in process 

 

  

hipaa and hitech 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims among the main requirements of hipaa are the “administrative simplification” provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions transactions standards requirements for protecting the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information privacy rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format security rule the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act which was enacted as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 amended certain provisions of hipaa and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates hitech also mandates individual notification in instances of data breach provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and grants enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

 

the privacy rule and hitech regulations establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

 















the security rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of personal health information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits the hitech act established a federal requirement for notification when the security of personal health information is breached in addition there is a patchwork of states laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

 

the requirements of the transactions standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under hipaa health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

 









we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with hipaa and hitech including administrative technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach education and training for employees in specific practices designed to help ensure against unauthorized use or access to personal health information and training on procedures for reporting a suspected breach in addition our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have 

patients’ rights legislation 

although no federal legislation has been enacted patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any enacted patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources 

employees

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid chip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid chip and abd premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid chip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints additionally state and federal entities may make changes to the design of their medicaid programs resulting in the cancellation or modification of these programs 

for example in august 2007 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms published a final rule regarding the estimation and recovery of improper payments made under medicaid and chip this rule requires a cms contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments in medicaid and chip and create national and state specific error rates states must provide information to measure improper payments in medicaid and chip for managed care and feeforservice each state will be selected for review once every three years for each program states are required to repay cms the federal share of any overpayments identified cms published a proposed rule on july 15 2009 that would make certain changes to the previously published rule among other things the proposed changes establish a process for appealing error determinations the changes will not become effective until the final rule is published we cannot predict whether a final rule will become effective and if it does what impact it will have on the states with which we have contracts 

 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 under this act states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs 

states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid chip foster care and abd the current adverse economic conditions have and are expected to continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the medicaid eligible population increases creating more need for funding we anticipate this will require government agencies with whom we contract to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for current programs and program expansions contraction of covered benefits limited or no premium rate increases or premium decreases in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid chip foster care and abd costs and eligibility if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

changes to medicaid chip foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business we believe that reductions in medicaid chip foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

if chip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

federal support for chip has been authorized through 2013 we cannot be certain that chip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2013 and if it is what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization thus we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their chip programs which matching funds have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have chip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid chip and abd we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire or renew between march 31 2010 and august 31 2013 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on august 25 2006 we received notification from the kansas health policy authority that firstguard health plan kansas inc’s contract with the state would not be renewed or extended and as a result our contract ended on december 31 2006 further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis our business will suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

if we are unable to participate in chip programs our growth rate may be limited 

chip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in chip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

for example congress is currently considering health care reform legislation we cannot predict the impact of any such legislation if adopted on our business 

the pending health care reform legislation could harm our business 

congress is currently considering legislation that could significantly reform the us health care system we cannot predict whether any legislation will be passed and if it is what impact it will have on our business if any reforms are implemented that reduce medicaid or chip spending or the payments we receive from states or increase taxes on hmos or mcos our business could suffer 

 

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues certain states including but not limited to georgia indiana new jersey texas and wisconsin have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

• cancellation of our contracts 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services and 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

 

  

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid chip foster care and abd programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

  

hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of data breach providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and granting enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa and will have to expend additional time and financial resources to comply with the hipaa provisions contained in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange or the nyse have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these compliance initiatives 

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 causes us to incur substantial expense and management effort moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage for example some states including indiana and ohio have removed and others could consider removing pharmacy coverage from the services covered by managed care entities we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

changes in funding for medicaid may affect our business for example on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 23 2008 the united states district court for the district of columbia vacated the final rule as improperly promulgated the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of 2009 indicates congressional intent is that final regulations should not be promulgated we cannot predict whether the rule will ever be finalized or otherwise implemented and if it is what impact it will have on our business 

legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs in addition the medicare prescription drug benefit interrupted the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

 

  

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

we can not be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those 

estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted ibnr by 97 million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 2006 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for example we commenced operations in south carolina in december 2007 began our foster care program in texas in april 2008 commenced operations in florida in february 2009 and in massachusetts in july 2009 and expect to commence operations in mississippi in 2010 for a period of time after the inception of business in these states we base our estimates on stateprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims 

from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our earnings could be negatively impacted 

in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers’ completeness and quality of claims submission our processing of the claim submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states’ encounter systems and the states’ acceptance and analysis of the encounter data if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership our earnings will be affected negatively 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs or uncontrollable epidemic or pandemic costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics or pandemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits in 2009 the h1n1 influenza pandemic resulted in heightened costs due to increased physician visits and increased utilization of hospital emergency rooms and pharmaceutical costs we cannot predict what impact the h1n1 influenza virus or any other epidemic or pandemic will have on our costs in the future additionally we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2009 we had 4405 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 5456 million of longterm investments and restricted deposits we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which may include asset backed securities bank deposits commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury insurance contracts and equity securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition for example in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a loss on investments of approximately 45 million due to a loss in a money market fund 

our investments in state and municipal securities are not guaranteed by the united states government which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2009 we had 3456 million of investments in state and municipal securities these securities are not guaranteed by the united states government state and municipal securities are subject to additional credit risk based upon each local municipality’s tax revenues and financial stability as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

 

  

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan and 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup 

operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business for example effective july 2008 we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group inc the parent company of celtic insurance company or celtic celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families while we believe that the addition of celtic will be complementary to our business we have not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse affect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 

the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years the availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has been restricted such conditions may persist throughout 2010 and beyond in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses make payments on our indebtedness pay capital expenditures including costs related to our corporate headquarters’ project or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 

our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that if credit could be obtained the terms and costs of such credit could be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our medicaid contract with kansas which terminated december 31 2006 together with our medicaid contract with missouri accounted for 3170 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal or rfp process our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided in addition current focus on health care reform and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs increases in the number of competitors and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

 

  

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

 

  

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management for example we have in the past or may be subject to in the future securities class action lawsuits irs examinations or similar regulatory actions any such matters could harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business 

as part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including hipaa and the grammleachbliley act the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 further expands the coverage of hipaa by among other things extending the privacy and security provisions requiring new disclosures if a data breach occurs mandating new regulations around electronic medical records expanding enforcement mechanisms allowing the state attorneys general to bring enforcement actions and increasing penalties for violations despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

if we are unable to complete the previously announced sale of certain assets of our new jersey health plan in a timely manner our business could suffer 

on november 20 2008 we announced that we had entered into an agreement with amerigroup corporation or amerigroup to sell certain assets of our subsidiary university health plans inc in the state of new jersey to amerigroup the agreement contains a number of conditions to closing including i the approval of regulators in new jersey ii the lack of a material adverse effect and iii other customary conditions on december 31 2008 we announced that we had received a termination notice from amerigroup relating to the new jersey transaction on october 23 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with amerigroup resolving all claims and expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2010 however if we are unable to complete the sale of our new jersey business our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

risks related to our corporate headquarters’ project could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in 2008 and 2009 our capital expenditures included costs associated with the construction of a real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business we are currently a joint venture partner in an entity that is developing the properties if the entity is unable to complete the development or if the entity delays or abandons the real estate project it may have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for example in 2007 we abandoned a previously planned redevelopment project and recorded a pretax impairment charge of 72 million our operations and efficiency could also be impacted if the development is not completed as there is limited office space for us to expand in the market near our existing headquarters as our business continues to grow 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own our corporate office headquarters building located in st louis missouri during 2008 and 2009 our capital expenditures included costs for the construction of a new real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business 

we generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2008 the internal revenue service or irs began an audit of our 2006 and 2007 tax returns as a result of this audit the irs has initially denied the 349 million tax benefit we recognized for the abandonment of the firstguard stock in 2007 we are proceeding with the appeals process and believe that it is more likely than not that our tax position will be upheld accordingly we have not made any adjustments to our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to this issue 

 

we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain we do not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

summarized comparative financial data for 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows  in millions 



 

 

  

revenues and revenue recognition 

  

our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

  

our specialty companies generate revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

some states enact premium taxes similar assessments and provider passthrough payments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses in 2009 one of the states in which we operate increased their premium which was required to be passed through to hospitals in the state for the year ended december 31 2009 this passthrough totaled 1329 million and increased our premium tax revenue and expense we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is in essence a passthrough of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 

premium and service revenues increased 184 in 2009 over 2008 as a result of membership growth in all our states discussed under the heading “membership” the effect of a full year of the celtic acquisition in july 2008 and premium rate increases the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments in 2009 we received premium rate increases in certain markets which yielded a 29 composite increase across all of our markets 

premium and service revenues increased 216 in 2008 over 2007 as a result of membership growth in arizona indiana and texas the celtic acquisition in july 2008 and premium rate increases in 2008 we received premium rate increases in certain markets which yield a 27 composite increase across all of our markets 

in november 2007 we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia of approximately 38 effective july 1 2007 we executed this amendment on november 16 2007 the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january 2008 and accordingly we recorded the additional revenue retroactive to july 1 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 the premium revenue related to the period from july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 totals approximately 208 million 

contract amendments related to rate increases for the georgia health plan effective july 1 2008 and 2009 were not fully executed until the respective fourth quarters and accordingly the premium revenue from july 1 to september 30 was recorded in the fourth quarter in each respective year 

 

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

  

medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we can not assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

  

results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred the health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category 

  



  

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2009 was 835 an increase of 10 over 2008 the increase in the total hbr in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to the effect of the following items 









these factors were partially offset by reductions in the hbr for our abd product particularly due to provider network improvements and exiting certain markets in ohio and growth in our south carolina abd membership which operates at a lower hbr than our normal range the decrease in our abd hbr lowered our total hbr by 17 for the year ended december 31 2009 

the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2008 was 825 a decrease of 14 over 2007 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2008 over 2007 is due to the effect of recording the georgia premium rate increase for the period to july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 in 2008 

cost of services 

cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager’s external revenues cost of services also includes all direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses associated with facilities and equipment used to provide services 

 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga increased in both the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our growth ga also increased in 2009 as result of the consolidation of access additionally ga increased in 2008 as a result of the acquisition of celtic ga expenses also include business expansion costs such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel contracting costs and information technology buildouts incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or state health plan for example we incurred business expansion costs for the foster care product in texas in 2008 and massachusetts in 2009 our ga in 2010 will include business expansion costs associated with our new contract in mississippi 

the ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were 133 136 and 143 respectively the decrease in the ratio in 2009 primarily reflects the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of celtic our business expansion costs for florida massachusetts and mississippi and the consolidation of access 

other income expense 





other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments earnings in equity method investments and interest expense on debt decreases in investment income in 2009 and 2008 reflect the decline in market interest rates the 2008 results included a loss of 45 million related to our investment in the reserve primary money market fund whose net asset value fell below 100 per share as of december 31 2009 the carrying amount of our investment in the reserve primary money market fund was 24 million in january 2010 we received a distribution from the fund of 54 million and will record a gain of 30 million in the first quarter of 2010 earnings from equity method investee decreased due to the inclusion of investment in access as a consolidated subsidiary beginning in 2009 interest expense was relatively stable reflecting modest increases in debt balances offset by the decline in market interest rates associated with variable rate debt 

income tax expense 

 

the effective tax rate in 2009 was 355 compared to 384 in 2008 and 359 in 2007 the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to the effect of the inclusion of the noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries for which we are not required to provide income taxes and an increase in 2008 due to a change in the estimated benefit to be realized from new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards excluding the effect of the noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate would have been 362 in 2009 the increase in 2008 from 2007 was due to higher state taxes as a result of a change in the estimated benefit to be realized from new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of uhp our new jersey health plan accordingly the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2010 uhp was previously reported in the medicaid managed care segment 

the pretax loss from discontinued operations was 36 million in 2009 and 10 million in 2008 compared to a pretax gain of 08 million in 2007 legal expenses of 18 million and employee retention expenses of 36 million related to the pending sale of uhp were included in the results from discontinued operations during 2009 the 2008 results include a onetime charge of 37 million primarily for asset impairments and employee severance related to the sale the assets and liabilities of the discontinued business are segregated in the consolidated balance sheet 

net earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 included tax benefits of 326 million net of asset writeoffs associated with the abandonment of the stock of our firstguard health plans 

segment results 

the following table summarizes our operating results by segment  in millions 



medicaid managed care 

premium and service revenues increased 158 in 2009 due to membership growth in our states especially florida indiana south carolina and texas premium and service revenues increased 185 in 2008 over 2007 due primarily to higher membership in texas from the foster care product atrisk membership growth in south carolina and the effect of recording the georgia premium rate increase of 208 million for the period july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 in 2008 

earnings from operations decreased in 2009 from 2008 levels due to the aforementioned effect of the georgia rate increase excluding the effects of recording this rate increase in 2008 earnings from operations increased 134 in 2009 over 2008 levels reflecting the overall growth in our membership and revenue base and improvements in our abd product especially in ohio and south carolina offset by a rate decrease in texas higher medical costs related to the flu and a higher hbr in florida 

 

specialty services 

premium and service revenues increased 285 in 2009 primarily due to a full year effect of the celtic acquisition the commencement of our new health plan in massachusetts and membership growth in our medicaid segment and the associated specialty services provided to this increased membership premium and service revenues increased 252 in 2008 over 2007 due primarily to the acquisition of celtic and higher membership in texas from the foster care product of which behavioral health comprises a significant percentage of the overall premium for this product 

earnings from operations increased 674 in 2009 from 2008 levels primarily due to the increase in revenue and leveraging of the segments infrastructure costs over this higher revenue base earnings from operations also increased due to a lower hbr 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

  

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 that we use throughout our discussion of liquidity and capital resources  in millions 

  



we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our total operating activities provided cash of 2482 million in 2009 2220 million in 2008 and 2022 million in 2007 cash flow from operations in 2009 reflects the receipt in december 2009 of premiums for the month of january 2010 for three of our health plans increasing our unearned revenue at december 31 2009 by 783 million as compared to the prior year end cash flow from operations also reflected an increase in medical claims liability primarily as a result of new business in florida massachusetts and south carolina cash flow from operations in 2008 reflected an increase in our medical claims liability as a result of new business in texas south carolina and arizona this was partially offset by a decrease in unearned revenue resulting from a timing difference with the receipt of our december revenue for our ohio health plan 

  

our investing activities used cash of 2701 million in 2009 1539 million in 2008 and 2255 million in 2007 cash flows from investing activities in 2009 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to longterm investments cash flows from investing activities also include the capital expenditures discussed below membership conversion fees in florida and acquisitions in florida and south carolina cash flows from investing activities in 2008 included the purchase price of celtic which we acquired on july 1 2008 capital expenditures and our investment in the reserve primary fund our investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to longterm investments 

our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2009 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 26 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury insurance contracts commercial paper bank deposits asset backed securities and equity securities these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity recent trading activity in similar securities and other observable inputs our investment guidelines are compliant with the regulatory restrictions enacted in each state 

the following table summarizes our cash and investment balances as of december 31  in millions 



 

we spent 831 million 652 million and 539 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of building construction software and hardware upgrades furniture equipment and leasehold improvements associated with office and market expansions exclusive of our real estate development discussed below we anticipate spending approximately 40 million on capital expenditures in 2010 primarily associated with system enhancements and market expansions 

during the second quarter of 2009 we executed an agreement as a joint venture partner in an entity that will develop property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we had capital expenditures of 595 million and 270 million respectively for costs associated with the real estate development the development is expected to be substantially complete in 2010 and we anticipate spending approximately 100 million on capital expenditures related to the construction in 2010 

in june 2009 this joint venture executed a 95 million construction loan associated with the development the construction loan is due june 1 2011 and may be extended for two additional one year terms the loan bears interest at the libor rate plus 4 with a minimum rate of 5 we and our development partner have each guaranteed up to 65 million associated with the construction loan the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements for us to maintain a specified net worth as of december 31 2009 there was 326 million outstanding under the construction loan additionally the joint venture has posted a 175 million letter of credit to a tenant of the development collateralized by a portion of the entity’s cash balances 

our financing activities provided cash of 466 million in 2009 424 million in 2008 and 208 million in 2007 during 2009 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our 300 million credit facility and construction financing of the real estate development discussed above during 2008 our financing activities primarily related to borrowings under our 300 million revolver and stock repurchases during 2007 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from issuance of 175 million in senior notes as discussed below 

at december 31 2009 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 998 million as compared to 254 million at december 31 2008 we manage our shortterm and longterm investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm requirements as needed our working capital was negative at december 31 2009 due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm 

at december 31 2009 our debt to capital ratio defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity was 332 as compared to 346 at december 31 2008 we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure among others of our leverage and financial flexibility 

 

on january 21 2010 we completed the sale of an additional 575 million shares of common stock for 1925 per share net proceeds from the sale of the additional shares were approximately 1045 million we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our 300 million revolving credit loan facility 840 million as of december 31 2009 we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include the repayment of indebtedness funding for acquisitions capital expenditures additions to working capital and to meet statutory capital requirements in new or existing states 

we have a 300 million revolving credit agreement borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from 015 to 0275 depending on the total debt to ebitda ratio the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum net worth the agreement will expire in september 2011 as of december 31 2009 we had 840 million in borrowings outstanding under the agreement and 405 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving availability of 1755 million as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants 

in 2007 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of our 725 senior notes due april 1 2014 or the notes the notes were registered under the securities act of 1933 pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers the indenture governing the notes contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio interest is paid semiannually in april and october as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants 

we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions no duration has been placed on the repurchase program and we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 332595 shares 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we received dividends of 191 million from our regulated subsidiaries on july 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of celtic for a purchase price of approximately 820 million net of unregulated cash acquired during the year ended december 31 2008 the company received a dividend from celtic of 314 million concurrent with the acquisition and received an additional dividend of 170 million from a regulated subsidiary during the year ended december 31 2007 we received dividends of 354 million for the excess regulatory capital remaining in our kansas and missouri health plans and dividends of 185 million from other regulated subsidiaries 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility and construction loan will be sufficient to finance our general operations planned acquisition of medicaid assets of south carolina and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future contractual obligations these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes credit facility mortgages construction loan and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

  



regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2009 our subsidiaries including uhp had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 4532 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 2865 million and we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage to be 347 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2009 each of our health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2009 the company adopted new guidance related to business combinations the changes from the previous guidance include but are not limited to 1 acquisition costs are recognized separately from the acquisition 2 known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition are considered part of the liabilities acquired and and measured at their fair value all other contingencies are part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability 3 contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events is recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition and 4 business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities as well as noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the full amounts of their fair values the new guidance has been utilized for all acquisitions since january 1 2009 

effective january 1 2009 the company adopted new guidance related to consolidation and reporting of noncontrolling interest which requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way that is as equity in the consolidated financial statements moreover this guidance eliminates the diversity that existed in accounting by requiring transactions between an entity and the noncontrolling interest be treated as equity transactions 

 

 

in april 2009 new guidance was issued related to the recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments the guidance applies to fixed maturity securities only and requires separate display of losses related to credit deterioration and losses related to other market factors when an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that an entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis it must recognize the credit component of an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

in june 2009 new guidance was issued related to the consolidation of variable interest entities to require an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the company a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity this guidance requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 and early adoption is prohibited the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

we have determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty and accordingly our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices healthcare service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors – failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

  

 

the paid and received completion factors claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2009 data 





while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 30 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 

  

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 

  



  

the acquisition in 2008 includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of celtic 

  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2009 will be known by the end of 2010 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions in addition claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member’s acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

 











  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2009 we had 2246 million of goodwill and 225 million of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 



 

  

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had shortterm investments of 396 million and longterm investments of 5456 million including restricted deposits of 201 million the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts us treasury investments asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2009 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 135 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

  

inflation 

  

while the inflation rate in 2009 for medical care costs was slightly less than that for all items historically inflation for medical care costs has generally exceeded that for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

 item 1 business 

 

overview 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or schip foster care medicare special needs plans and the supplemental security income program also known as the aged blind or disabled program or collectively abd medicaid currently accounts for 73 of our membership while schip also including foster care and abd also including medicare account for 22 and 5 respectively our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health individual health insurance life and health management longterm care programs managed vision nurse triage and pharmacy benefits management to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries our specialty services segment also provides a full range of healthcare solutions for the rising number of uninsured americans 

during 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of university health plans inc this pending sale is discussed in detail under the caption “discontinued operations” under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” accordingly our new jersey health plan operations are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements beginning with this annual report on form 10k the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified for the year ended december 31 2008 our revenues total cash flow from operations and net earnings were 34 billion 2220 million and 842 million respectively 

 

our medicaid managed care segment membership totaled approximately 12 million as of december 31 2008 while our specialty services segment external membership totaled 163100 we currently have health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in arizona georgia indiana ohio south carolina texas and wisconsin as well as new jersey additionally effective in july 2007 we acquired a minority interest in access health solutions llc or access which provides managed care on a nonrisk basis for medicaid recipients in florida in february 2009 we began operations in florida through our whollyowned subsidiary sunshine state health plan inc we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

 

we believe our local approach to managing our health plans including provider and member services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7711 carondelet avenue st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc” 

 

industry 

we provide our services to organizations and individuals primarily through medicaid schip foster care and abd programs the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 311 billion in 2006 and estimate the market will grow to 720 billion by 2017 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 53 in fiscal 2008 and states appropriated an increase of 58 for medicaid in fiscal 2009 budgets 

 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs— one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don’t select a health plan we refer to these states as mandated managed care states eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act abd covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to cms there were approximately seven million dual eligible enrollees in 2006 these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our abd and longterm care programs and beginning in 2008 through special needs plans 

 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

 

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives additionally a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans the us census bureau estimated there were 457 million americans in 2007 that lacked health insurance continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid schip foster care and abd populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our business strategy 

 

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured population and state funded healthcare initiatives we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medicaid managed care 

 

health plans 

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

 

 

 

 

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of each year our managed care subsidiaries in georgia ohio and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2008 other financial information about our segments is found in note 20 segment information  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

benefits to states 

 

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers 

 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2008 the health plans we operated contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

 

 

 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement 

 

 

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the member connections  epsdt case management and health management programs for example the member connections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health health management managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefit management and treatment compliance when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

 

quality management 

 

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

 

information technology 

 

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions we continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

 

  our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan 

 

specialty services 

 

our specialty services segment is a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complements our core medicaid managed care business specialty services diversifies our revenue stream provides higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assists in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate compliance 

 

our corporate ethics and compliance program was first established in 1998 and provides methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

 

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations the audit committee and the board of directors review a compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition 

 

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations  

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

 

 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 

 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors — competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

 

regulation 

 

our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements or other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state contracts 

in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

 

our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

 

a health plan or individual health insurance providers’ compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

 

the table below sets forth the term of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions as of january 1 2009 

 

 

 

hipaa 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims among the main requirements of hipaa are standards for the processing of health insurance claims and related transactions 

 

the regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under the hipaa regulations health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

 

 

hipaa regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations including education and training for employees in addition the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

Ÿ the state law is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the provision of and payment for healthcare 

Ÿ the state law is necessary to ensure appropriate state regulation of insurance and health plans 

Ÿ the state law is necessary for state reporting on healthcare delivery or costs or 

Ÿ the state law addresses controlled substances 

in 2003 hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information compliance with these regulations was required by april 2005 these regulations require healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits in addition numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

patients’ rights legislation 

the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in 2001 both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no such federal legislation has been enacted patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any enacted patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 3600 employees none of our employees are represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid schip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid schip and abd premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid schip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints additionally state and federal entities may make changes to the design of their medicaid programs resulting in the cancellation or modification of these programs 

for example in august 2007 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms published a final rule regarding the estimation and recovery of improper payments made under medicaid and schip this rule requires a cms contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments in medicaid and schip and create national and state specific error rates states must provide information to measure improper payments in medicaid and schip for managed care and feeforservice each state will be selected for review once every three years for each program states are required to repay cms the federal share of any overpayments identified 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 under this act states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs 

 

states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid schip foster care and abd in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid schip foster care and abd costs and eligibility 

 

changes to medicaid schip foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business we believe that reductions in medicaid schip foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

if schip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

federal support for schip has been authorized through 2013 we cannot be certain that schip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2013   and if it is what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization thus we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business  

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their schip programs which matching funds have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that these states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have schip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid schip and abd we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire or renew between march 31 2009 and december 31 2010 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on august 25 2006 we received notification from the kansas health policy authority that firstguard health plan kansas inc’s contract with the state would not be renewed or extended and as a result our contract ended on december 31 2006 further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis our business will suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 

if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be limited 

 

schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

 

 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

 

for example congress has previously considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and such legislation may be proposed again we cannot predict the impact of any such legislation if adopted on our business 

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues certain states including but not limited to georgia indiana new jersey texas and wisconsin have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

• cancellation of our contracts 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services and 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid schip foster care and abd programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange or the nyse have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these compliance initiatives 

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 causes us to incur substantial expense and management effort moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

 

for example in august 2007 cms issued guidance that imposes requirements on states that cover children in families with incomes above 250 of the federal poverty level under these requirements applicable states must provide assurances to cms that the state has enrolled at least 95 of the medicaid and schip eligible children in the state who are in families with incomes below 200 of the federal poverty level in medicaid or schip and that the number of children insured through private employers has not decreased by more than two percentage points over the prior five year period two states in which we have schip contracts georgia and new jersey are subject to these requirements if they are unable to meet these requirements they will be unable to continue to cover children in families with incomes above 250 of the federal poverty level which would likely decrease our membership in such states many states object to these requirements as unduly burdensome and likely to result in a decrease in the number of children covered by schip and some states including new jersey are pursuing legal challenges against cms in relation to these requirements in the guidance cms stated that it expected states to comply with the requirements within 12 months of the issuance of the guidance however in august 2008 a cms spokesperson stated that for the time being cms would not take compliance action to enforce this requirement further on february 4 2009 president obama issued a memorandum to the secretary of health and human services requesting the immediate withdrawal of the august 2007 guidance and implementation of schip without the requirements imposed by the august 2007 guidance we cannot predict whether legal challenges to august 2007 guidance will be successful or whether these requirements will be rescinded by cms we cannot predict the impact these requirements will have on our revenue if changes are implemented in states in which we serve schip beneficiaries 

 

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

the bush administration previously proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive instead of federal matching funds combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm healthcare for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 25 2007 president bush signed an iraq war supplemental spending bill that included a oneyear moratorium on the effectiveness of the final rule on june 30 2008 president bush signed another iraq war supplemental spending bill that extends the moratorium on the effectiveness of the final rule until april 1 2009 we cannot predict whether the rule will ever be implemented and if it is what impact it will have on our business 

 

recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs in its fiscal year 2009 budget proposal the bush administration has also proposed to further reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 174 billion over the next five years these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states’ medicaid programs which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance in addition the medicare prescription drug benefit interrupted the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

we can not be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted ibnr by 97 million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 2006 

 

additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability for example we commenced operations in south carolina in december 2007 and began our foster care program in texas in april 2008 for a period of time after the inception of business in these states we based our estimates on state provided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our earnings could be negatively impacted 

in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers’ completeness and quality of claims submission our processing of the claim submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states’ encounter systems and the states’ acceptance and analysis of the encounter data if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership our earnings will be affected negatively 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 4804 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 3417 million of longterm investments and restricted deposits we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which may include commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury insurance contracts and equity securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition for example in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a loss on investments of approximately 45 million due to a loss in a money market fund 

 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan and 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business for example effective july 2008 we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group inc the parent company of celtic insurance company or celtic celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families while we believe that the addition of celtic will be complementary to our business we have not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially for example our medicaid contract with kansas which terminated december 31 2006 together with our medicaid contract with missouri accounted for 3170 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our financial position results of operations or cash flows to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management for example we have in the past or may be subject to in the future securities class action lawsuits irs examinations or similar regulatory actions any such matters could harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to complete the previously announced sale of certain of assets of our new jersey health plan in a timely manner our business could suffer 

on november 20 2008 we announced that we had entered into an agreement with amerigroup corporation or amerigroup to sell certain assets of our subsidiary university health plan inc in the state of new jersey to amerigroup the agreement contains a number of conditions to closing including i the approval of regulators in new jersey ii the lack of a material adverse effect and iii other customary conditions on december 31 2008 we announced that we had received a termination notice from amerigroup relating to the new jersey transaction as we have previously stated we do not believe that there is cause to terminate the new jersey agreement and are prepared to pursue all available means to bring this transaction to closure to this end on january 8 2009 we announced that in response to amerigroup’s purported termination of this agreement we had filed a lawsuit against amerigroup in the superior court of new jersey chancery division nonetheless if we are unable to close the new jersey transaction in a timely manner our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

risks related to our corporate headquarters’ project could harm our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in 2008 our capital expenditures included 270 million for land and fees associated with the construction of a real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in an entity that will develop the properties due to the global financial crisis and disruptions in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to complete this project under economically feasible terms if the company is unable to complete the development or if the company delays or abandons the real estate project it may have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for example in 2007 we abandoned a previously planned redevelopment project and recorded a pretax impairment charge of 72 million our operations and efficiency could also be impacted if the development is not completed as there is limited office space for us to expand in the market near our existing headquarters as our business continues to grow 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own our corporate office headquarters building located in st louis missouri during 2008 our capital expenditures included land and fees for the construction of a new real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in the entity that will develop the relevant properties 

we generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on january 8 2009 we filed a complaint in the chancery division of the superior court of new jersey asserting a breach of contract claim against amerigroup new jersey or agpnj and a tortuous interference with contract claim against amerigroup corporation in connection with agpnj’s refusal to proceed to closing under its contract to purchase certain assets of university health plan’s or uhp’s business in december 2008 agpnj sent us a termination notice claiming that a material adverse effect had occurred under the contract and attempted to terminate the contract we are contesting whether a material adverse effect occurred and correspondingly the propriety and validity of the purported termination and are seeking to obtain specific performance of the contract and damages 

 

we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain we do not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or schip and supplemental security income including aged blind or disabled programs or abd our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health individual health insurance life and health management longterm care programs managed vision nurse triage and pharmacy benefits management to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries our specialty services segment also provides a full range of healthcare solutions for the rising number of uninsured americans 

during 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of university health plans inc or uhp our new jersey health plan in addition our medicaid contract in kansas terminated effective december 31 2006 and we sold the operating assets of firstguard health plan inc our missouri health plan effective february 1 2007 unless specifically noted the discussions below are in the context of continuing operations and therefore exclude our new jersey health plan uhp as well as our kansas and missouri health plans collectively referred to as firstguard the results of operations for uhp and firstguard are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

results of continuing operations and key metrics 

the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap 

summarized comparative financial data for 2008 2007 and 2006 are as follows  in millions 

 

 

 

revenues and revenue recognition 

 

our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members in some instances our base premiums are subject to an adjustment or risk score based on the acuity of our membership generally the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state’s medicaid membership some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

 

our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

 

our total revenue increased in the year ended december 31 2008 over the previous year primarily through 1 membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment 2 premium rate increases and 3 growth in our specialty services segment 

 

 

from december 31 2006 to december 31 2008 we increased our medicaid managed care membership by 113 the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

 

 

from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 our membership increased as a result of growth in indiana and texas in texas we increased our membership through organic growth of schip especially in the exclusive provider organization or epo market in addition we increased texas membership through our new foster care program with 33100 members at december 31 2008 we increased our membership in indiana through temporary eligibility determinations and network expansions our membership decreased in wisconsin due to the termination of certain provider contracts in south carolina we continue to add atrisk membership as additional counties convert with 31300 atrisk members at december 31 2008 substantially all of the prior year membership in south carolina was on a nonrisk basis in florida access served 97100 members on a nonrisk basis at december 31 2008 

from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 our membership increased primarily as a result of increases in ohio south carolina and texas we increased our medicaid membership in ohio by adding members under our new contract in the northwest region we also increased our membership in ohio with the commencement of our new contract to serve aged blind or disabled members our membership in south carolina was primarily on a nonrisk basis we began conversion to atrisk in december 2007 with 100 atrisk members at december 31 2007 in texas we increased our membership through new medicaid schip and abd contracts in the corpus christi san antonio austin and lubbock markets our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs eligibility administration issues and the termination of certain physician contracts associated with a high cost hospital system our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to adjustments made to our provider network made in connection with our new statewide contract as well as the termination of certain nonexclusive physician contracts in florida access served 90600 members on a nonrisk basis at december 31 2007 

the total revenue associated with university health plans included in results from discontinued operations was 1506 million 1503 million and 1395 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our university health plan membership was 55200 57300 and 58900 at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the total revenue associated with firstguard included in results from discontinued operations was 0 67 million and 3170 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our firstguard membership was 138900 at december 31 2006 

 

in 2008 we received premium rate increases in some markets which yield a 27 composite increase across all of our markets in 2007 we received premium rate increases in some markets which yield a 26 composite increase across all of our markets 

in november 2007 we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia of approximately 38 effective july 1 2007 the state also mandated service changes retroactively recalculated certain rate cells and adjusted for duplicate member issues we executed this amendment on november 16 2007 the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january 2008 and accordingly we recorded the additional revenue retroactive to july 1 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 this premium revenue related to the period from july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 totals approximately 208 million approximately 73 million of this amount is related to the mandated services rate cell changes and duplicate member issues the remaining 135 million yields the calculated 38 increase 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 specialty services segment revenue from external customers was 3443 million compared to 2454 million for the same prior year period the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of celtic as well as increasing membership for both our behavioral health company cenpatico and bridgeway 

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our specialty services segment 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

medical costs 

 

our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate the assumptions we consider include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices health care service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 

while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates accordingly we can not assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

 

our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

 

 

our consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2008 was 825 a decrease of 14 over 2007 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2008 over 2007 is due to the effect of recording the georgia premium rate increase retroactive to july 1 2007 in 2008 our consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31 2007 was 839 a decrease of 02 over 2006 the decrease is primarily attributable to increased premium yield combined with a moderating medical cost trend particularly with a decrease in pharmacy costs offset by the new abd business in ohio and the transition of these new members into a managed care environment 

cost of services 

our cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager’s external revenues cost of services also includes all direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses associated with facilities and equipment used to provide services 

general and administrative expenses 

our general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga increased in both the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth ga also increased in 2008 as a result of the acquisition of celtic ga in 2007 also included charges totaling 124 million for fixed asset impairment severance for an organizational realignment and a contribution to our charitable foundation with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of firstguard missouri the fixed asset impairment resulted from abandoning a previously planned headquarters development in clayton missouri 

our ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of the sum of premium revenues and service revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues the consolidated ga expense ratio for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 136 143 and 150 respectively the decrease in the ratio in 2008 primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of celtic and of our startup costs in florida and for our texas foster care product the decrease in the ratio in 2007 primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues offset by the effect of our startup costs in south carolina and for our texas foster care product and the 124 million charge discussed above 

other income expense 

 

 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments our equity in earnings of investments and interest expense on our debt investment income decreased 86 million in 2008 over the comparable periods in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was due to a loss on investments of 45 million recorded in the third quarter of 2008 and an overall decline in market interest rates the loss was primarily related to investments in the reserve primary money market fund whose net asset value fell below 100 per share the loss represents less than 1 of centene’s cash and investment portfolio as of december 31 2008 we expect to recover 95 of our reserve primary fund investments money market funds are generally recorded in cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheet however our investment in the reserve primary money market fund is recorded in shortterm investments due to the restrictions placed on redemptions imposed by the fund as of december 31 2008 we had recovered most of the investment in the reserve primary fund these decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings from our equity method investee access investment income increased 84 million in 2007 over the comparable period in 2006 the increase was primarily a result of larger investment balances interest expense increased in 2007 over the comparable period in 2006 due to larger debt balances resulting from our senior notes issuance 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate in 2008 was 384 compared to 359 in 2007 the increase in the current year was due to higher state taxes as a result of a change in the estimated benefit to be realized from new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards our 2007 effective tax rate was 359 compared to 352 for the corresponding period in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the effect of an increase in taxexempt investment income and lower state taxes 

 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we announced our intention to sell certain assets of university health plans inc or uhp our new jersey health plan accordingly the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented uhp was previously reported in the medicaid managed care segment in november 2008 we announced a definitive agreement to sell certain assets of our new jersey health plan to amerigroup new jersey or agpnj in december 2008 agpnj sent us a termination notice we have filed a complaint seeking specific performance of the contract and damages additional information regarding this matter is included in “item 3 legal proceedings” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

in august 2006 firstguard health plan kansas inc or firstguard kansas our wholly owned subsidiary received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december 31 2006 would not be renewed in 2006 we also evaluated our strategic alternatives for our firstguard missouri health plan and decided to divest the business the sale of the operating assets of firstguard missouri was completed effective february 1 2007 accordingly the results of operations for firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri were previously reported in the medicaid managed care segment additionally the assets and liabilities of the discontinued businesses are segregated in the consolidated balance sheet 

net earnings losses from discontinued operations were a net loss of 07 million in 2008 compared to earnings of 324 million in 2007 and a net loss of 612 million in 2006 the 2008 results include a onetime charge of 37 million primarily for asset impairments and employee severance related to the sale of the new jersey health plan at december 31 2008 the remaining liability for these charges was 11 million in 2007 we abandoned the stock of our firstguard health plans resulting in tax benefits of 326 million net of the associated asset writeoffs the 2007 results also included a gain on the sale of firstguard missouri of 75 million as well as operational and exit costs associated with firstguard the 2006 results included a firstguard goodwill impairment charge of 811 million a firstguard intangible asset impairment charge of 60 million as well as operational and exit costs associated with firstguard 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 that we use throughout our discussion of liquidity and capital resources in millions 

 

 

we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our total operating activities provided cash of 2220 million in 2008 2022 million in 2007 and 1950 million in 2006 cash flow from operations in 2008 reflected an increase in our medical claims liability as a result of new business in texas south carolina and arizona cash flow from operations also increased by a change in our cash management procedure whereby negative book cash balances resulting from checks issued but not yet presented to our bank for payment are now included in accounts payable and accrued expenses these factors were partially offset by a decrease in unearned revenue resulting from a timing difference with the receipt of our december revenue for our ohio health plan the medical claims liability increased in 2007 reflecting new business in ohio and texas offset by the payment in 2007 of firstguard claims incurred in 2006 

 

our investing activities used cash of 1539 million in 2008 2255 million in 2007 and 1502 million in 2006 cash flows from investing activities in 2008 included the purchase price of celtic which we acquired on july 1 2008 capital expenditures and our investment in the reserve primary fund previously discussed at december 31 2008 our investment in the reserve fund totaled 130 million and was included in shortterm investments our investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to longterm investments our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2008 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 24 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds corporate bonds instruments of the us treasury insurance contracts commercial paper and equity securities these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity and other observable inputs the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 

we spent 652 million 539 million and 503 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of software and hardware upgrades and furniture equipment and leasehold improvements associated with office and market expansions the expenditures in 2008 included 320 million for computer hardware and software we anticipate spending approximately 30 million on capital expenditures in 2009 primarily associated with system enhancements and market expansions 

in 2008 our capital expenditures included 270 million for land and fees associated with the construction of a real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in an entity that will develop the properties if the company is unable to complete the development or if the company delays or abandons the real estate project it may have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows our operations and efficiency could also be impacted if the development is not completed as there is limited office space for us to expand in the market near our existing headquarters as our business continues to grow 

our financing activities provided cash of 424 million in 2008 208 million in 2007 and 789 million in 2006 during 2008 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our 300 million credit facility and stock repurchases during 2007 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from issuance of 175 million in senior notes as discussed below 

at december 31 2008 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 254 million as compared to 405 million at december 31 2007 we manage our shortterm and longterm investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm requirements as needed our working capital was negative at december 31 2007 due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 4804 million at december 31 2008 and 3134 million at december 31 2007 longterm investments were 3417 million at december 31 2008 and 3235 million at december 31 2007 including restricted deposits of 93 million and 64 million respectively at december 31 2008 cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 241 million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled 7980 million additionally we held regulated cash and investments of 301 million from discontinued operations upon completion of the sale of assets of uhp and the subsequent payment of medical claims liabilites and other liabilities at the closing date the remaining regulated cash of uhp will be transferred to our unregulated cash 

we have a 300 million revolving credit agreement borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from 015 to 0275 depending on the total debt to ebitda ratio the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum net worth the agreement will expire in september 2011 as of december 31 2008 we had 630 million in borrowings outstanding under the agreement and 241 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving availability of 2129 million as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants 

in 2007 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 ¼ senior notes due april 1 2014 or the notes the notes were registered under the securities act of 1933 pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers the indenture governing the notes contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio interest is paid semiannually in april and october as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants 

we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in october 2008 the repurchase program was extended through october 31 2009 but we reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any time during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 1218858 shares at an average price of 1929 we have established a trading plan with a registered broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions 

on july 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of celtic for a purchase price of approximately 820 million net of unregulated cash acquired concurrent with the acquisition we received regulatory approval to pay a dividend from celtic to centene in an amount of 314 million while still maintaining a capital structure we believe to be conservative as a result of the dividend the net effect on our unregulated cash was approximately 50 million during the year ended december 31 2008 we received additional dividends of 170 million from other regulated subsidiaries 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our planned acquisition of amerigroup community care of south carolina our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

 

 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2008 consisted of medical claims liability debt operating leases purchase obligations interest on longterm debt unrecognized tax benefits and other longterm liabilities our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facilities mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

1 includes debt related to capital lease obligations 

2 interest on 175000 senior notes 

3 unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provision for fasb interpretation no 48 

4 includes 15949 s epar ate account liabilities from third party reinsurance that will not be settled in cash

 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

 

our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2008 our subsidiaries including uhp had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 3914 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 2415 million and we estimate our risk based capital or rbc percentage to be 340 of the authorized control level 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2008 each of our health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb statement no141 revised 2007 business combinations  the purpose of issuing the statement was to replace current guidance in fasb statement no141 business combinations to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction the changes to be effected with fasb statement no 141r from the current guidance include but are not limited to 1 acquisition costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition 2 known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired and and measured at their fair value all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability 3 contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition 4 business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities as well as noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the full amounts of their fair values and 5 a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisitiondate fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer fasb statement no 141r will be effective for any business combinations that occur after january 1 2009 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fasb statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which was issued to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way that is as equity in the consolidated financial statements moreover fasb statement no 160 eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions fasb statement no 160 will be effective january 1 2009 the adoption of fasb statement no 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 

we have determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty and accordingly our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

medical claims liability 

our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 

we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include without limitation claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience changes in membership provider billing practices health care service utilization trends cost trends product mix seasonality prior authorization of medical services benefit changes known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza provider contract changes changes to medicaid fee schedules and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 

we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability see “risk factors – failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

additionally we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information together with management’s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 

our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period as additional information becomes known to us we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 

 

the completion factor claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2008 data 

 

 

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by 23 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

 

the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

1 days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 

 

the acquisition in 2008 includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of celtic the acquisition in 2006 includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare 

 

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result the liability generally is described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31 2008 will be known by the end of 2009 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim accordingly any change in behavior leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us additionally certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member’s acuity in these cases determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined because of the complexity of our business the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2008 we had 1634 million of goodwill and 176 million of other intangible assets 

intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the following periods 

 

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

 

goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors these factors include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 

 

in november 2008 as a result of our decision to divest the new jersey health plan we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assts as a result of the analysis and expected selling price we determined that the identifiable intangible assets were not impaired 

in august 2006 firstguard health plan kansas inc or firstguard kansas our wholly owned subsidiary received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december 31 2006 would not be renewed as a result of these events we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value the impairment analysis resulted in a total noncash intangible asset impairment charge of 871 million consisting of 811 million of goodwill and 60 million of other identifiable intangible assets which was recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

investments 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had shortterm investments of 1094 million and longterm investments of 3417 million including restricted deposits of 93 million the shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts us treasury investments and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2008 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 62 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to see risk factors–risks related to our business–our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity” 

 

inflation 

 

while the inflation rate in 2008 for medical care costs was slightly less than that for all items historically inflation for medical care costs has generally exceeded that for all items we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

 

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

overview 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or schip and supplemental security income program or ssi medicaid currently accounts for 74 of our membership while schip and ssi account for 20 and 6 respectively our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health life and health management longterm care programs managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries on marketbased terms for the year ended december 31 2007 our revenues from continuing operations cash flow from operations and net earnings were 29 billion 2022 million and 734 million respectively 

 

our medicaid managed care membership totaled approximately 11 million as of december 31 2007 we currently have seven health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in georgia indiana new jersey ohio south carolina texas and wisconsin additionally effective in july 2007 we acquired a minority interest in access health solutions llc or access which provides managed care on a nonrisk basis for medicaid recipients in florida we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

 

we believe our local approach to managing our health plans including provider and member services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7711 carondelet avenue st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “cnc”

industry 

we provide our services to organizations and individuals primarily through medicaid schip and ssi programs the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 313 billion in 2005 and estimate the market will grow to 680 billion by 2016 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 29 in fiscal 2007 and states appropriated an increase of 63 for medicaid in fiscal 2008 budgets 

 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs— one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don’t select a health plan we refer to these states as mandated managed care states currently 44 of the 56 programs including each of the seven states in which we operate health plans have mandated managed care for some or all of their medicaid recipients eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

 

 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act ssi covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments ssi beneficiaries including aged blind or disabled or abd program beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition ssi recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services there were approximately seven million dual eligible enrollees in 2006 these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our ssi and longterm care programs and beginning in 2008 through special needs plans 

 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

 

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states including each of the seven states in which we operate health plans have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the medicaid schip and ssi populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our business strategy 

 

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on medicaid and medicaidrelated services we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medicaid managed care 

 

health plans 

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

 

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness for example cold and flu season resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of each year our managed care subsidiaries in georgia indiana ohio texas and wisconsin had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2007 other financial information about our segments is found in note 19 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

benefits to states 

 

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers 

 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2007 the health plans we currently serve contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a feeforservice capitation arrangement or risksharing arrangement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the connections epsdt case management and health management programs for example the connections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health health management managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefit management and treatment compliance when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

 

quality management 

 

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including health management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

 

 

information technology 

 

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions we believe we have the ability to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

 

our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan 

    

specialty services 

 

our specialty services segment is a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complements our core medicaid managed care business the specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate compliance 

 

our corporate ethics and compliance program was first established in 1998 and provides methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and helps assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

 

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations the audit committee and the board of directors review a compliance report on a quarterly basis 

competition 

 

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations  

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 

 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors — competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

 

 

regulation 

 

our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

 

 

 

 

state contracts 

in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

 

our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

 

a health plan’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

 

 

  the table below sets forth the term of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

hipaa 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims among the main requirements of hipaa are standards for the processing of health insurance claims and related transactions 

 

the regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under the hipaa regulations health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

 

hipaa regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations including education and training for employees in addition the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

Ÿ the state law is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the provision of and payment for healthcare 

Ÿ the state law is necessary to ensure appropriate state regulation of insurance and health plans 

Ÿ the state law is necessary for state reporting on healthcare delivery or costs or 

Ÿ the state law addresses controlled substances 

in 2003 hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information compliance with these regulations was required by april 2005 these regulations require healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits in addition numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

patients’ rights legislation 

the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in 2001 both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no such federal legislation has been enacted patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any enacted patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

 

 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 3100 employees our employees are not represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid schip and ssi funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid schip and ssi premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid schip and ssi funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints additionally state and federal entities may make changes to the design of their medicaid programs resulting in the cancellation or modification of these programs 

for example in august 2007 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms published a final rule regarding the estimation and recovery of improper payments made under medicaid and schip this rule requires a cms contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments in medicaid and schip and create national and state specific error rates states must provide information to measure improper payments in medicaid and schip for managed care and feeforservice each state will be selected for review once every three years for each program states are required to repay cms the federal share of any overpayments identified 

 

on february 8 2006 president bush signed the deficit reduction act of 2005 to reduce the size of the federal deficit the act reduces federal spending by nearly 40 billion over 5 years including a 5 billion reduction in medicaid the act reduces spending by cutting medicaid payments for prescription drugs and gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits this law may also lead to lower medicaid reimbursements in some states the bush administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2009 proposes cutting medicaid funding by 174 billion in funding reductions over five years states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid schip and ssi in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid schip and ssi costs and eligibility 

changes to medicaid schip and ssi programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs all of which could have a negative impact on our business we believe that reductions in medicaid schip and ssi payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

 

 

if schip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls our business could suffer 

schip was initially authorized for a period of ten years through 2007 in late 2007 congress passed two separate schip reauthorization bills that would have expanded schip coverage however president bush vetoed each of these bills since they could not come to agreement on longterm schip reauthorization terms president bush and congress agreed to extend schip funding through march 31 2009 we cannot be certain that schip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in 2009   and if it is what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization there are differing views as to what should be contained in an schip reauthorization bill it is unclear how and when these differences will be resolved and therefore we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business assuming schip is reauthorized 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their schip programs which matching funds have a per state annual cap because of funding caps there is a risk that these states could experience shortfalls in future years which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have schip contracts 

if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid schip and ssi we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire between march 31 2008 and december 31 2010 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on august 25 2006 we received notification from the kansas health policy authority that firstguard health plan kansas inc’s contract with the state would not be renewed or extended and as a result our contract ended on december 31 2006 further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially affected 

if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be limited 

 

schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

• force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network 

• require us to implement additional or different programs and systems 

• mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 

• restrict revenue and enrollment growth 

• require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers 

• increase our healthcare and administrative costs 

• impose additional capital and reserve requirements and 

• increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 

 

for example congress has previously considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and such legislation may be proposed again we cannot predict the impact of any such legislation if adopted on our business 

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue in certain circumstances our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues certain states including but not limited to georgia indiana new jersey and texas have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 

 

 

we face periodic reviews audits and investigations under our contracts with state government agencies and these audits could have adverse findings which may negatively impact our business 

we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

• refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts 

• imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us 

• loss of our right to participate in various markets 

• increased difficulty in selling our products and services and 

• loss of one or more of our licenses 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid schip and ssi programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business we have already expended significant time effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 

in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange or the nyse have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these compliance initiatives 

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

 

 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

for example in august 2007 cms issued guidance that imposes new requirements on states that cover children in families with incomes above 250 of the federal poverty level under these new requirements applicable states must provide assurances to cms that the state has enrolled at least 95 of the medicaid and schip eligible children in the state who are in families with incomes below 200 of the federal poverty level in medicaid or schip and that the number of children insured through private employers has not decreased by more than two percentage points over the prior five year period three states in which we have schip contracts georgia new jersey and wisconsin are subject to these new regulations if they are unable to meet these new requirements they will be unable to continue to cover children in families with incomes above 250 of the federal poverty level which would likely decrease our membership in such states many states object to these new requirements as unduly burdensome and likely to result in a decrease in the number of children covered by schip and some states including new jersey are pursuing legal challenges against cms in relation to these new requirements cms expects states to comply with the new requirements within 12 months of the issuance of the guidance we cannot predict whether legal challenges to the new policy will be successful or whether the reauthorized version of schip will expressly address these new requirements we cannot predict the impact these requirements will have on our revenue if changes are implemented in states in which we serve schip beneficiaries 

  

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

the bush administration previously proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive instead of federal matching funds combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm healthcare for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

on may 29 2007 cms issued a final rule that would reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this rule may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance on may 25 2007 president bush signed an iraq war supplemental spending bill that includes a oneyear moratorium on the effectiveness of the final rule we cannot predict whether the rule will ever be implemented and if it is what impact it will have on our business 

recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs in its fiscal year 2009 budget proposal the bush administration has also proposed to further reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 174 billion over the next five years these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states’ medicaid programs which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance in addition the new medicare prescription drug benefit is interrupting the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

 

 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible clients into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible clients into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 

our medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if necessary are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted our ibnr by 97 million for adverse medical cost development from the first quarter of 2006 in addition when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities for example we commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia on june 1 2006 and the southwest region of georgia on september 1 2006 and have based our estimates on state provided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received data from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our earnings could be negatively impacted 

 

 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

• additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture 

• provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks 

• existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan and 

• disparate administrative accounting and finance and information systems 

additionally our growth strategy includes startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue as a result these startup operations may decrease our profitability in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally we would become subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions or startup operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 

 

 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date for example our medicaid contract with kansas which terminated december 31 2006 together with our medicaid contract with missouri accounted for 3170 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and operating results could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could cause our operating results to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

 

 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and require significant attention from our management for example in 2006 we were named in two securities class action lawsuits the status of these lawsuits is discussed below under “item 3 legal proceedings” in addition we may in the future be the target of similar litigation as with other litigation securities litigation could be costly and time consuming require significant attention from our management and could harm our business and operating results

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own our corporate office headquarters building located in st louis missouri in september 2007 we announced the signing of a letter of intent to locate our corporate headquarters in downtown st louis missouri we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in the entity that will develop the relevant properties we expect that the other partners will serve as project developers and coordinate the project financing 

we lease claims processing facilities in missouri and montana we generally lease space in the states where our health plans and specialty companies operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 

 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously disclosed two class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri or eastern district court the lawsuits were consolidated on november 2 2006 and an amended consolidated complaint was filed in the eastern district court on january 17 2007 which we refer to as the consolidated lawsuit the consolidated lawsuit alleges on behalf of purchasers of our common stock from april 25 2006 through july 17 2006 that we and certain of our officers and directors violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false statements prior to the announcement of our fiscal 2006 second quarter results according to the consolidated lawsuit these allegedly materially false statements had the effect of artificially inflating the price of our common stock which subsequently dropped after the issuance of a press release announcing our preliminary fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings and revised guidance we filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuit on june 29 2007 the motion to dismiss was granted the plaintiffs have appealed the order of dismissal and briefing on the appeal has been completed oral argument on the appeal has not yet been held we anticipate receiving a decision on the appeal during 2008 

additionally in august 2006 a separate derivative action was filed on behalf of centene corporation against us and certain of our officers and directors in the eastern district court plaintiff purported to bring suit derivatively on behalf of the company against the company’s directors for breach of fiduciary duties gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets by reason of the directors’ alleged failure to correct the misstatements alleged in the consolidated lawsuit discussed above the derivative complaint largely repeated the allegations in the consolidated lawsuit based on discussions that have been held with plaintiff’s counsel it is our understanding that plaintiff did not intend to pursue this action unless the consolidated lawsuit proceeded past the dismissal stage the derivative action has been dismissed 

in addition we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain we do not expect the results of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or schip and supplemental security income including aged blind or disabled programs or ssi our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health life and health management longterm care programs managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance to state programs healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries on marketbased terms 

our medicaid contract in kansas terminated effective december 31 2006 and we sold the operating assets of firstguard health plan inc our missouri health plan effective february 1 2007 unless specifically noted the discussions below are in the context of continuing operations and therefore exclude the kansas and missouri health plans collectively referred to as firstguard health plans the results of operations for firstguard are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

our financial performance for 2007 is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over the last two years we have experienced membership and revenue growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 587 the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth 

 

 

 

 

 

we have opportunities to expand our operations through the following acquisitions and new contract awards 

 

 

the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to the growth in our specialty services segment during the last two years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of continuing operations and key metrics 

summarized comparative financial data for 2007 2006 and 2005 are as follows  in millions 

 

 

revenues and revenue recognition 

 

our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenue as well as operating expenses some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

 

our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries on marketbased terms revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

our total revenue increased in the year ended december 31 2007 over the previous year primarily through 1 membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment 2 premium rate increases and 3 growth in our specialty services segment 

 

from december 31 2005 to december 31 2007 we increased our medicaid managed care membership by 587 the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

 

from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 our membership increased primarily as a result of increases in ohio south carolina and texas we increased our medicaid membership in ohio by adding members under our new contract in the northwest region we also increased our ssi membership in ohio with the commencement of our new contract to serve aged blind or disabled members our membership in south carolina is primarily on a nonrisk basis we began conversion to atrisk in december 2007 with 100 atrisk members at december 31 2007 in texas we increased our membership through new medicaid schip and ssi contracts in the corpus christi san antonio austin and lubbock markets our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs eligibility administration issues and the termination of certain physician contracts associated with a high cost hospital system our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to adjustments made to our provider network made in connection with our new statewide contract as well as the termination of certain nonexclusive physician contracts in florida access served 90600 members on a nonrisk basis at december 31 2007 

during 2006 our subsidiary peach state health plan commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia in june and in the southwest region in september we increased our membership in ohio through the mediplan acquisition while also adding members under our new contract in the east central and northwest markets in texas we increased our membership through new contracts in the corpus christi austin and lubbock markets our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs and eligibility administration issues our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to provider terminations 

the total revenue associated with firstguard included in results from discontinued operations was 67 million 3170 million and 2737 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our firstguard membership was 138900 and 149300 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

in 2007 we received premium rate increases ranging from 19 to 101 or 27 on a composite basis across our markets in 2006 we received premium rate increases ranging from 18 to 95 or 58 on a composite basis across our markets 

in november 2007 we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia of approximately 38 effective july 1 2007 the state also mandated service changes retroactively recalculated certain rate cells and adjusted for duplicate member issues we executed this amendment on november 16 2007 the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january 2008 and accordingly we will record the additional revenue retroactive to july 1 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 this revenue related to the period from july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 totals approximately 208 million approximately 73 million of this amount is related to the mandated services rate cell changes and duplicate member issues the remaining 135 million yields the calculated 38 increase 

 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 specialty services segment revenue from external customers was 2454 million compared to 1920 million for the same prior year period the increase is primarily attributable to a full year of operations in 2007 of our acquisition of opticare in july 2006 and the commencement of operations of bridgeway health solutions in october 2006 at december 31 2007 our behavioral health company cenpatico provided behavioral health services to 99900 members in arizona and 39000 members in kansas compared to 94500 members in arizona and 36600 members in kansas at december 31 2006 

in january 2006 we began offering pharmacy benefits management through our acquisition of us script representing most of the 2006 increase in consolidated service revenue additionally in may 2006 we expanded our life and health management services through our acquisition of cardium in july 2006 we began offering managed vision care through our acquisition of opticare in october 2006 our subsidiary bridgeway health solutions began performing under our longterm care contract in arizona 

operating expenses 

 

medical costs 

 

our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties associated with fluctuations in physician billing patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available we employ actuarial professionals and use the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

 

our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

 

 

our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december 31 2007 was 832 a decrease of 11 over 2006 the decrease is primarily attributable to increased premium yield combined with a moderating medical cost trend particularly with a decrease in retail pharmacy costs 

our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december 31 2006 was 843 an increase of 28 over 2005 the increase in hbr for the year ended december 31 2006 is caused primarily by increased cost trends for maternity related costs including neonatal intensive care costs increased physician costs and increased pharmacy costs 

the increase in the ssi hbr for the year ended december 31 2007 is a result of the new ssi business in ohio and the transition of these new members into a managed care environment 

the decrease in our specialty services hbr for year ended december 31 2007 is caused by the diversification of business in that segment   our specialty services hbr for 2006 includes twelve months of the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas six months of opticare and three months of bridgeway the 2005 results include twelve months of our behavioral health contract in kansas and six months of arizona results 

cost of services 

our cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager’s external revenues cost of services also includes all direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses associated with facilities and equipment used to provide services 

 

 

general and administrative expenses 

our general and administrative expenses or ga primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs associated with our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing ga increased in the year ended december 31 2007 over the comparable period in 2006 primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth ga in 2007 also included charges totaling 124 million for fixed asset impairment severance for an organizational realignment and a contribution to our charitable foundation with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of firstguard missouri the fixed asset impairment resulted from abandoning our previously planned headquarters development in clayton missouri ga expenses increased in the year ended december 31 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth especially in arizona and georgia and the adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 the results for the year ended december 31 2006 include 139 million of implementation expenses in georgia and 99 million of additional stock compensation expense 

our ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of the sum of premium revenue and service revenue and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues the following table sets forth the ga expense ratios by business segment 

 

the decrease in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2007 primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues offset by the effect of our startup costs in south carolina and for our texas foster care product and the 124 million charge discussed above   the increase in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2006 primarily reflects the adoption of sfas 123r offset by the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 

the decrease in the specialty services ga expense ratio in 2007 primarily reflects the overall leveraging of expenses over higher revenues with the addition s   of bridgeway and opticare and the growth of us script’s business since the acquisition in january 2006    the 2006 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona the acquisitions of us script and airlogix as well as the acquisition of cardium effective may 9 2006 and opticare effective july 1 2006 the results for the year ended december 31 2006 include approximately 07 million in implementation costs associated with our longterm care contract in arizona the 2005 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona including 15 million in implementation costs and 02 million in georgia implementation costs 

other income expense 

 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments our equity in earnings of investments and interest expense on our debt investment and other income increased 88 million in 2007 over the comparable periods in 2006 the increase was primarily a result of larger investment balances interest expense increased 50 million in 2007 primarily from increased debt 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate in 2007 was 351 compared to 376 in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the effect of an increase in taxexempt investment income and lower state taxes our 2006 effective tax rate was 376 compared to 343 for the corresponding period in 2005 

discontinued operations 

net earnings from discontinued operations were 321 million in 2007 compared to a net loss of 646 million in 2006 in 2007 we abandoned the stock of our firstguard health plans resulting in tax benefits of 326 million net of the associated asset writeoffs the 2007 results also included a gain on the sale of firstguard missouri of 75 million as well as operational and exit costs associated with firstguard the 2006 results included a goodwill impairment charge of 811 million an intangible asset impairment charge of 60 million as well as operational and exit costs

at december 31 2007 we had negative working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 405 million as compared to 639 million at december 31 2006 our working capital is negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm we manage our shortterm and longterm investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm requirements as needed

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

 

our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2007 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 3021 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 1923 million 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2007 each of our health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no141 revised 2007 “business combinations” or sfas no 141r the purpose of issuing the statement is to replace current guidance in sfas no141 to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction the changes to be effected with sfas no 141r from the current guidance include but are not limited to 1 acquisition costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition 2 known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability 3 contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition 4 business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities as well as noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the full amounts of their fair values and 5 a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisitiondate fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer sfas no 141r will be effective for any business combinations that occur after january 1 2009 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” or sfas no 160 sfas no 160 was issued to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way that is as equity in the consolidated financial statements moreover sfas no 160 eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions sfas no 160 will be effective january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 160 will have our financial statements and disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 

 

medical claims liabilities 

 

our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 

 

our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates in developing our estimate for ibnr we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities see “risk factors – failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results” these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

 

the completion factor claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2007 data 

 

 

 

 

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by 21 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

 

the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 

     

  1 days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 

 

the acquisition in 2006 includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare 

 

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december 31 2007 will be known by the end of 2008 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development including changes in medical utilization and cost trends as well as the effect of establishing the liabilities under moderately adverse conditions we implement various medical management initiatives in our markets which may contribute to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 

 

intangible assets 

 

we have made several acquisitions since 2005 that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2007 we had 1410 million of goodwill and 132 million of other intangible assets purchased contract rights are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to ten years provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to ten years customer relationships are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to fifteen years trade names are amortized using the straightline method over 20 years 

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

 

 

goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors these factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts in august 2006 firstguard health plan kansas inc or firstguard kansas our wholly owned subsidiary received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december 31 2006 would not be renewed as a result of these events we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans 

the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value the impairment analysis resulted in a total noncash intangible asset impairment charge of 871 million consisting of 811 million of goodwill and 60 million of other identifiable intangible assets which was recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2006

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

investments 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had shortterm investments of 463 million and longterm investments of 3443 million including restricted deposits of 273 million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts us treasury investments and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2007 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 53 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

 

 

inflation 

 

although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

 

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

overview 

 

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating primarily in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid the state children’s health insurance program or schip and supplemental security income or ssi medicaid currently accounts for 79 of our membership while schip and ssi account for 19 and 2 respectively our specialty services segment provides specialty services including behavioral health disease management longterm care programs managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance to state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries on marketbased terms our firstguard health plans exited the kansas and missouri markets effective january 1 and february 1 2007 respectively 

our medicaid managed care membership totaled approximately 13 million as of december 31 2006 an increase of 45 from december 31 2005 that membership includes 107000 and 31900 members in kansas and missouri respectively we currently have six health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in georgia indiana new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin we provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

we believe our local approach to managing our subsidiaries including provider and member services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities our disease management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing 

our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in 1984 we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 our corporate office is located at 7711 carondelet avenue st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 

we maintain a website with the address wwwcentenecom we are not including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this filing we make available free of charge through our website our section 16 filings annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the sec 

 

industry 

 

we provide our services to organizations and individuals primarily through medicaid schip and ssi programs the congressional budget office or cbo estimated the total medicaid market was approximately 330 billion in 2005 and the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimate the market will grow to over 450 billion by 2010 according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid spending increased by 28 in fiscal 2006 and states appropriated an increase of 50 for medicaid in fiscal 2007 budgets 

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states providing health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs—one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs currently 37 of the 56 programs including each of the six states in which we operate health plans have mandated managed care for some or all of their medicaid recipients eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

established in 1972 and authorized by title xvi of the social security act ssi covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments ssi beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition ssi recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 

the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

 

a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare according to information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured dual eligibles account for 14 of medicaid enrollees these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues we serve dual eligibles through our ssi and longterm care programs 

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality health care and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states including each of the six states in which we operate health plans have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the medicaid schip and ssi populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

our competitive strengths 

 

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

 

 

 

 

  through employment and education on how best to access care we complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing which allows us to minimize general and administrative expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions we believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both medicaid and specialty services while maintaining our local accountability and improved access 

 

 

 

 

our strategy 

 

our objective is to become the leading multiline healthcare enterprise focusing on medicaid and medicaidrelated services we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medicaid managed care 

 

health plans 

 

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

 

 

 

benefits to states 

 

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our specialized programs in working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member programs and services 

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locallybased staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

 

 

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    medicaid population such as asthma diabetes and prenatal care our specialty services segment manages many of our disease management programs our ssi program uses a proprietary assessment tool that effectively identifies barriers to care unmet functional needs available social supports and the existence of behavioral health conditions that impede a member’s ability to maintain a proper health status care coordinators develop individual care plans with the member and healthcare providers ensuring the full integration of behavioral social and acute care services these care plans while specific to an ssi member incorporate “condition specific” practices in collaboration with physician partners and community resources 

 

providers 

 

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2006 the health plans we currently serve contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

 

our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians specialty care physicians include orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services 

 

our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a feeforservice or capitation arrangement 

 

 

 

 

  we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies 

 

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members this approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs improve services to our members and simplify the administrative burdens on our providers it has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the connections epsdt case management and disease management programs for example the connections staff facilitates doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

where appropriate our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health disease management managed vision nurse triage pharmacy benefit management and treatment compliance when necessary we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare vision care diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 

 

quality management 

 

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including disease management and complex case management that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

 

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

 

in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

 

information technology 

 

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions we believe we have the ability to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

 

our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner as needed 

 

we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan 

specialty services 

 

  our specialty services segment is a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complements our core medicaid managed care business the specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and assist in controlling costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following interrelated businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate compliance 

 

our corporate ethics and compliance program was first established in 1998 and provides methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and helps assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

 

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services 

our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations the audit committee and the board of directors review a full compliance report including an incident log on a quarterly basis 

 

competition 

 

we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure in addition our specialty companies also compete with other providers such as disease management companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts 

 

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 

 

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities see “risk factors  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve” 

 

financial information 

 

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories our managed care subsidiaries in georgia indiana kansas texas and wisconsin had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2006 other financial information about our segments is found in note 18 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

regulation 

 

our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

 

states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

 

 

 

 

 

state contracts 

in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 

our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

 

 

a health plan’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

the table below sets forth the term of our state contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

hipaa 

 

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims among the main requirements of hipaa are standards for the processing of health insurance claims and related transactions 

the regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under the hipaa regulations health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

hipaa regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations including education and training for employees in addition the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant   exceptions   allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

in 2003 hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information compliance was required by april 2005 these rules require healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits in addition numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

patients’ rights legislation 

the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in june and august 2001 respectively both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no such federal legislation has been enacted patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

 

other fraud and abuse laws 

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 2600 employees our employees are not represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

risks related to being a regulated entity 

reduction in medicaid schip and ssi funding could substantially reduce our   profitability 

most of our revenues come from medicaid schip and ssi premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid schip and ssi funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints additionally state and federal entities may make changes to the design of their medicaid programs resulting in the cancellation or modification of these programs 

for example in august 2006 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms published an interim final rule regarding the estimation and recovery of improper payments made under medicaid and schip this rule requires a cms contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments in medicaid and schip and create national and state specific error rates states must provide information to measure improper payments in medicaid managed care as well as in feeforservice medicaid each state will be selected for review once every three years for each program states are required to repay to cms the federal share of any overpayments identified 

on february 8 2006 president bush signed the deficit reduction act of 2005 to reduce the size of the federal deficit the act reduces federal spending by nearly 40 billion over the next 5 years including a 5 billion reduction in medicaid the act reduces spending by cutting medicaid payments for prescription drugs and gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits this law may also lead to lower medicaid reimbursements in some states the bush administration’s budget proposal also seeks to further reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 14 billion over the next five years in addition the bush administration has proposed freezing federal spending for schip at the levels set in 2007 for ten years states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid schip and ssi in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid schip and ssi costs and eligibility 

changes to medicaid schip and ssi programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs we believe that reductions in medicaid schip and ssi payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

if schip is not reauthorized our business could suffer 

 

the authorization for schip expires at the end of federal fiscal year 2007 we cannot guarantee that federal funding of schip will be reauthorized and if it is what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization if schip is not reauthorized by september 30 2007 it will continue to be funded at the current 2006 federal funding levels we expect congress to begin the reauthorization process in early february 2007 at this time it is not clear whether the relevant congressional committees of jurisdiction over this program will be able to reach agreement on an schip reauthorization package that could cost 50 billion in additional federal spending 

 

several states face a shortfall in federal schip funding which could have an impact on our business 

states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their schip programs which matching funds have a per state annual cap it is predicted that two states in which we have schip contracts georgia and new jersey will spend all of their federal allocation for fiscal year 2007 prior to the end of the year in december 2006 congress passed legislation that will redistribute funds that were not spent in prior years to the states that are facing these shortfalls the congressional research service estimates that this legislation will delay the shortfall to the first part of may 2007 we cannot predict whether the us congress will appropriate additional funds or take other legislative action to cover the shortfalls further we cannot predict if states will provide additional funding to cover the federal shortfall our contracts with georgia and new jersey expire at the end of june and we cannot guarantee that they will be renewed and if renewed whether the terms will be modified if either of the contracts is not renewed or if either state delays paying us or fails to pay the full amount owed due to the shortfall our business could suffer 

 

 

if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business   will suffer 

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid schip and ssi we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so our current contracts are set to expire between june 30 2007 and september 30 2011 when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended for example on august 25 2006 we received notification from the kansas health policy authority that firstguard health plan kansas inc’s contract with the state would not be renewed or extended and as a result our contract ended on december 31 2006 further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies for example the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially affected 

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of   providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we   operate and could harm our business 

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example congress has previously considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and such legislation may be proposed again we cannot predict the impact of any such legislation if adopted on our business 

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or establish limits on our profitability other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue for example our texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the state of texas in the event profits exceed established levels these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues certain states including but not limited to georgia indiana new jersey and texas have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results 

 

 

we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services pursuant to these contracts we are subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations any adverse review audit or investigation could result in 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal   penalties 

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid schip and ssi programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations   and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations the issuance of new regulations or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange or the nyse have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these new compliance initiatives 

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being 

 

considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment   into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will   likely decrease 

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for twoyear periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

the bush administration previously proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive instead of federal matching funds combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm healthcare for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in april 2004 the bush administration adopted a policy that seeks to reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers this policy if continued may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs the bush administration has also proposed to further reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 14 billion over the next five years these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states’ medicaid programs which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance in addition the new medicare prescription drug benefit is interrupting the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state   regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations or hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be limited 

schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our   subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business   strategy 

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

risks related to our business 

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect   our business 

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible clients into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible clients into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our   reported results 

our medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if necessary are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations for example in the three months ended june 30 2006 we adjusted our ibnr by 97 million for adverse medical cost development from the first quarter of 2006 in addition when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities for example we commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia on june 1 2006 and the southwest region of georgia on september 1 2006 and have based our estimates on state provided historical actuarial data and limited 2006 actual incurred and received data from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our   revenues and profitability 

our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed in addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs our earnings could be negatively impacted 

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would   reduce our profitability 

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our   business 

historically the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

 

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

our acquisitions may increase costs increase liabilities or create disruptions in our   business 

we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire even an indepth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies as a result we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems integration may be hindered by among other things differing procedures including internal controls business practices and technology systems we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

 

 

 

 

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably 

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from   us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our   business lines 

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our   results of operations 

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

  we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of   states and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in   premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

operations in georgia indiana kansas texas and wisconsin have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states for example our medicaid contract with kansas terminated december 31 2006 our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we   serve 

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our   profitability may be harmed 

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and operating results could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and   operating results 

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services 

 

require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our   business 

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could   cause our operating results to suffer if state and federal budgets   decrease or do not increase 

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could   cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are   improving 

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our   operations could be disrupted 

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments   inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from time to time states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a 

 

state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

from time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and   other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our   management 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results in addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and require significant attention from our management for example we have been named in two recentlyfiled securities class action lawsuits that are now consolidated in addition we may in the future be the target of similar litigation as with other litigation securities litigation could be costly and time consuming require significant attention from our management and could harm our business and operating results 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties   

our corporate office headquarters building is located in st louis missouri the real estate we own surrounding this building is adequate to accommodate office expansion needs to support future company growth effective december 30 2005 we executed an agreement with the city of clayton missouri a suburb of st louis for the redevelopment of certain properties surrounding our corporate offices our primary purpose for the agreement is to accommodate office expansion needs for future company growth the total scope of the project includes building two new office towers and streetlevel retail space we plan to occupy a portion of those towers the total expected cost of the project is approximately 190 million it is not our intent to serve as developer of the project or finance the project construction costs we operate claims processing facilities in missouri and montana we lease space in the states where our health plans and specialty companies operate we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously disclosed two class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri one in july 2006 or the july class action lawsuit and one in august 2006 or the august class action lawsuit the july class action lawsuit and the august class action lawsuit were consolidated on november 2 2006 and an amended consolidated complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri on january 17 2007 which we refer to as the consolidated class action lawsuit the consolidated class action lawsuit alleges on behalf of purchasers of our common stock from april 25 2006 through july 17 2006 that we and certain of our officers and directors violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false statements prior to the announcement of our fiscal 2006 second quarter results according to the consolidated class action lawsuit these allegedly materially false statements had the effect of artificially inflating the price of our common stock which subsequently dropped after the issuance of a press release announcing our preliminary fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings and revised guidance we believe the case is without merit and have filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action lawsuit 

 

additionally in august 2006 a separate derivative action was filed on behalf of centene corporation against us and certain of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri plaintiff purports to bring suit derivatively on behalf of the company against our directors for breach of fiduciary duties gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets by reason of the directors’ alleged failure to correct the misstatements alleged in the consolidated class action lawsuits discussed above the derivative complaint largely repeats the allegations in the consolidated class action lawsuits based on discussions that have been held with plaintiff’s counsel it is our understanding that plaintiff does not intend to pursue this action until the consolidated class action lawsuits proceed past the dismissal stage although this matter is in its early stages and no precise prediction of its outcome can be made we believe the case is without merit and plan to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 

 

 

in addition we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain we do not expect the results of any of these matters discussed above individually or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

over the last two years we have experienced membership and revenue growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 633 excluding our membership in kansas and missouri from the total membership as of december 31 2006 our membership growth was 454 the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have been awarded the following new contracts to expand our operations in ohio and texas 

 

 

 

our specialty services segment has experienced significant year over year growth largely because of the acquisition of us script the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations and key metrics 

summarized comparative financial data for 2006 2005 and 2004 are as follows  in millions 

 

 

revenues and revenue recognition 

 

our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments collectively premium taxes and these taxes are recorded as ga expenses some contracts allow for additional premium related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

 

our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations as well as from our own subsidiaries on marketbased terms revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

 

our total revenue increased in the year ended december 31 2006 over the previous year primarily through 1 membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment 2 premium rate increases and 3 growth in our specialty services segment 

 

from december 31 2004 to december 31 2006 we increased our total membership by 633 or 454 if we exclude our membership in kansas and missouri at december 31 2006 the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment 

 

 

during 2006 our subsidiary peach state health plan commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia in june and in the southwest region in september we increased our membership in ohio through the mediplan acquisition while also adding members under our new contract in the east central and northwest markets in texas we increased our membership through new contracts in the corpus christi austin and lubbock markets our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs and eligibility administration issues our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to provider terminations the revenue associated with our kansas and missouri health plans was 3170 and 2737 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in 2005 we increased our membership in ohio through our acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of summacare inc our membership increased in indiana new jersey and wisconsin from additions to our provider networks expansion into ssi in wisconsin increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries in kansas we increased our membership by eliminating a ceiling on our membership total with the state our membership decreased in missouri and texas because of more stringent eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs 

 

in 2006 we received premium rate increases ranging from 18 to 95 or 56 on a composite basis across our markets in 2005 we received premium rate increases ranging from 06 to 87 or 32 on a composite basis across our markets 

 

in 2005 we began performing under our behavioral health contracts with the states of arizona and kansas in july 2005 we began offering disease management services through our acquisition of airlogix in january 2006 we began offering pharmacy benefits management through our acquisition of us script representing most of the 2006 increase in service revenue additionally in may 2006 we expanded our disease management services through our acquisition of cardium in july 2006 we began offering managed vision care through our acquisition of opticare in october 2006 our subsidiary bridgeway health solutions began performing under our longterm care contract in arizona the increase in service revenue reflects the acquisitions of us script airlogix and cardium at december 31 2006 our behavioral health company cenpatico provided behavioral health services to 

 

94500 members in arizona and 36600 members in kansas compared to 94700 members in arizona and 38800 members in kansas at december 31 2005 

operating expenses 

 

medical costs 

 

our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available we employ actuarial professionals and use the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

 

our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our health benefits ratio or hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category 

 

 

 

our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december 31 2006 was 826 an increase of 08 over 2005 the hbr for the year ended december 31 2005 included 45 million for settlement of a lawsuit with aurora health care inc or aurora a provider of medical professional services to our wisconsin health plan this settlement increased the hbr 03 for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in hbr for the year ended december 31 2006 is caused primarily by increased cost trends for maternity related costs including neonatal intensive care costs increased physician costs and increased pharmacy costs 

our specialty services hbr for 2006 includes twelve months of the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas six months of opticare and three months of bridgeway the 2005 results include twelve months of our behavioral health contract in kansas and six months of arizona results 

our medicaid and schip hbr increased in 2005 due to our settlement of a lawsuit with aurora and expansion into new markets previously unmanaged by us for example we experienced higher cost trends in indiana where we added membership in 2005 as the state expanded their medicaid managed care program to include all medicaid and schip enrollees 

cost of services 

our cost of services expense includes all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide services cost of services also includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pbms external revenues cost of services rose 549 million for the year ended december 31 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 the increase in cost of services reflects the acquisitions of us script airlogix and cardium 

general and administrative expenses 

our general and administrative or ga expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits including stock compensation expense and other administrative costs related to our health plans specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing premium taxes are also classified as ga expenses ga expenses increased in the year ended december 31 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth especially in arizona and georgia an increase in premium taxes the adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 and the exit costs for our firstguard operations premium taxes totaled 425 million in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 98 million for the comparable period in 2005 the results for the year ended december 31 2006 include 139 million of implementation expenses in georgia 99 million of additional stock compensation expense and 134 million of firstguard exit costs 

our ga expense ratio represents ga expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues the following table sets forth the ga expense ratios by business segment 

 

 

the increase in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2006 primarily reflects the increase in premium taxes the adoption of sfas 123r and exit costs of our firstguard operations offset by the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 

the decrease in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2005 reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues and lower compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans these factors were partially offset by implementation costs in georgia of 62 million higher spending on information systems process improvements and increased charitable contributions 

the specialty services ga ratio varies depending on the nature of the services provided and will generally be higher than the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio the 2006 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona the acquisitions of us script and airlogix as well as the acquisition of cardium effective may 9 2006 and opticare effective july 1 2006 the results for the year ended december 31 2006 include approximately 07 million in implementation costs related to our longterm care contract in arizona the 2005 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona including 15 million in implementation costs and 02 million in georgia implementation costs   

in 2006 we reassessed the calculations used to determine the proportion of certain costs allocated among each of our two segments this assessment included an evaluation of whether the costs should be allocated based on revenue number of claims or headcount measures and altered the proportion of certain ga costs the altered percentages resulted in the allocation of an additional 136 million to the medicaid managed care segment for the year ended december 31 2006 than would have been allocated under the previous formulas 

other income expense 

 

other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments and interest expense on our debt   investment and other income increased 72 million in 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates and larger investment balances interest expense increased 66 million primarily from increased borrowings under our credit facilities 

income tax expense 

 

we recorded 220 million of income tax expense in 2006 despite having a 216 million pretax loss because the 811 million goodwill impairment loss is not deductible for income tax purposes excluding the goodwill impairment our 2006 effective tax rate was 370 compared to 352 for the corresponding period in 2005 the 2005 effective tax rate included lower expense resulting from the resolution of state income tax examinations and the recognition of deferred tax benefits related to a change in law 

 

impairment loss 

  in august 2006 firstguard health plan kansas inc or firstguard kansas our wholly owned subsidiary received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december 31 2006 would not be renewed we appealed this decision and initiated litigation in an attempt to renew this medicaid contract these actions were unsuccessful and the contract terminated december 31 2006 in 2006 we also evaluated the strategic alternatives for our firstguard missouri health plan and decided to divest the business the sale of the operating assets of firstguard missouri was completed effective february 1 2007 firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri are reported in the medicaid managed care segment 

 

as a result of the notification from the kansas health policy authority we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit which encompassed both the firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri health plans the fair value of the firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value the impairment analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment of 811 million recorded as impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes however a tax benefit for the stock of firstguard kansas may be realized in 2007 the cash proceeds in 2007 from the firstguard missouri sale and tax benefit for the stock of firstguard kansas are estimated to total between 30 and 40 million 

earnings per share and shares outstanding 

 

our earnings per share calculations in 2006 reflect lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the exclusion of the effect of outstanding stock awards which would be antidilutive to net earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our total operating activities provided cash of 1950 million in 2006 740 million in 2005 and 994 million in 2004 the increase in cash flow from operations in 2006 reflects an increase in medical claims liabilities primarily from the commencement of our operations in georgia and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses those increases are partially offset by an increase in premium and related receivables in 2006 that reflect an increase in maternity delivery receivables reimbursements due to us from providers including amounts due under capitated risksharing contracts and the inclusion of us script receivables cash flow from operations in 2005 reflects an increase in premium and related receivables and a 45 million increase in medical claims liabilities the increase in receivables resulted primarily from the timing of delivery receivable collections the increase in medical claims liabilities lower than in prior years reflects the 95 million payment made to aurora to settle a lawsuit information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona 

 

our investing activities used cash of 1503 million in 2006 564 million in 2005 and 1225 million in 2004 during 2006 our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of us script cardium mediplan and opticare our investing activities in 2006 also included additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries during 2005 our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of airlogix and the operating assets of summacare inc our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2006 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 12 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds corporate bonds insurance contracts commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 

we spent 503 million 269 million and 250 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of software and hardware upgrades and furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions the expenditures in 2006 included 277 million for computer hardware and software we anticipate spending 60 million on additional capital expenditures in 2007 primarily related to system upgrades and market expansions 

the expenditures in 2006 also included 95 million to purchase several properties contiguous to our corporate headquarters as part of our redevelopment agreement with the city of clayton missouri we anticipate spending approximately 20 million for additional property in clayton missouri related to this agreement in the second quarter of 2006 our subsidiary executed a threeyear 25 million nonrecourse revolving credit facility to finance the property already acquired or expected to be acquired under the redevelopment agreement as of december 31 2006 we had 84 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 

our primary purpose for the redevelopment agreement is to accommodate office expansion needs for future company growth the total scope of the project includes building two new office towers and streetlevel retail space we plan to occupy a portion of those towers the total expected cost of the project is approximately 190 million it is not our intent to serve as developer of the project or finance the project construction costs 

our financing activities provided cash of 789 million in 2006 457 million in 2005 and 428 million in 2004 during 2006 and 2005 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility these borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction with the acquisition of summacare airlogix us script cardium and mediplan 

at december 31 2006 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 639 million as compared to 580 million at december 31 2005 we manage our shortterm and longterm investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm capital requirements as needed 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 3380 million at december 31 2006 and 2041 million at december 31 2005 longterm investments were 1707 million at december 31 2006 and 1462 million at december 31 2005 including restricted deposits of 253 million and 226 million respectively at december 31 2006 cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 289 million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled 4798 million 

 

in september 2006 we executed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement the amendment increases the total amount available under the credit agreement to 300 million from 200 million including a subfacility for letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to 75 million borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from 015 to 0275 depending on the 

 

total debt to ebitda ratio the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth the agreement will expire in september 2011 as of december 31 2006 we had 1490 million in borrowings outstanding under the agreement and 156 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving availability of 1354 million as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all covenants 

 

we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the repurchase program extends through october 31 2007 but we reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any time during the year ended december 31 2006 we repurchased 397400 shares at an average price of 1971 we have established a trading plan with a registered broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions 

we have a shelf registration statement on form s3 on file with the securities and exchange commission or the sec covering the issuance of up to 300 million of securities including common stock and debt securities no securities have been issued under the shelf registration we may publicly offer securities from timetotime at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing additionally the cash and investments in our kansas and missouri health plans are sufficient to satisfy the remaining liabilities we expect the excess funds will become available to us for general corporate purposes when our regulatory obligations have been satisfied 

our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2006 consisted of medical claims liabilities debt operating leases and purchase obligations our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facilities mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts in addition to agreements pertaining to the expansion of our corporate headquarters the contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

 

 

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

 

our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2006 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 2489 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 1540 million 

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2006 our georgia indiana new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin health plans were in compliance with the riskbased capital requirements enacted in those states had kansas or missouri adopted riskbased capital requirements we believe we would be in compliance at december 31 2006 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued interpretation 48 or fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by the taxing authority the adoption of fin 48 on january 1 2007 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 063 “how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” or eitf 063 the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net 

basis is an accounting policy decision premium taxes and similar assessments are within the scope of eitf 063 we plan to adopt eitf 063 effective january 1 2007 and will report premium revenues net of premium taxes and similar assessments the adoption of eitf 063 is expected to result in lower revenue and general and administrative expenses with no effect on our net earnings statement of financial position or stockholders’ equity the amount of premium taxes and similar assessments reported in 2006 was 425 million 

critical accounting policies 

 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 

 

medical claims liabilities 

 

our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid or inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 

 

our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates in developing our estimate for ibnr we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates when we commence operations in a new state or region we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities see “risk factors  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results” the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

 

the completion factor claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2006 data 

 

 

 

 

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions in 2006 and 2004 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare and firstguard respectively 

 

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december 31 2006 will be known by the end of 2007 

actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

 

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development including changes in medical utilization and cost trends these changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our “margin protection” programs and changes in our member demographics for all of our membership we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer to as our “margin protection” programs that assist with the control of medical utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies while we try to predict the savings from these programs actual savings have proven to be better than anticipated which has contributed to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 

 

intangible assets 

 

we have made several acquisitions since 2004 that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships purchased contract rights provider contracts trade names and goodwill at december 31 2006 we had 1359 million of goodwill and 162 million of other intangible assets purchased contract rights are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to ten years provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to ten years customer relationships are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from five to seven years trade names are amortized using the straightline method over 20 years 

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

 

goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors these factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts in august 2006 firstguard health plan kansas inc or firstguard kansas our wholly owned subsidiary received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december 31 2006 would not be renewed as a result of these events we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans 

the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value the impairment analysis resulted in a total noncash intangible asset impairment charge of 871 million consisting of 811 million of goodwill and 60 million of other identifiable intangible assets is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2006

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

 

investments 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had shortterm investments of 669 million and longterm investments of 1707 million including restricted deposits of 253 million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts and us treasury investments and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are 

classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2006 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 23 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

 

inflation 

 

although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

 

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases

industry 

  

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states providing health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states the majority of funding is provided at the federal level each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs—one for each us state each us territory and the district of columbia the national association of state budget officers nasbo estimates the total medicaid market was approximately 310 billion in 2004 and the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimate the market will grow to over 400 billion by fiscal year 2007 medicaid spending increased by 75 in fiscal 2005 according to the most recent survey by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured states appropriated an increase of 55 for medicaid in fiscal 2006 budgets the nasbo reports medicaid expenditures are approximately 22 of all state spending medicaid eligibility is based on a combination of income and asset requirements subject to federal guidelines often determined by an income level relative to the 

  

federal poverty level the number of persons covered by medicaid increased from 23 million in 1989 to approximately 45 million in 2005 historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

  

ssi beneficiaries receive the majority of their healthcare needs through medicaid ssi beneficiaries are people with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments state medicaid expenditures related to the ssi population represents the largest component of all medicaidrelated expenses 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose household income level does not allow them to qualify for medicaid schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid and some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 

  

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

  

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality health care and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states including each of the seven states in which we operate health plans have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans currently 42 states have mandated managed care for some or all of their medicaid recipients and other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the medicaid ssi and schip populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

  

our approach 

  

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our strategy 

  

our objective is to become the leading multiline medicaid and medicaidrelated healthcare enterprise we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

medicaid managed care 

  

health plans 

  

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve we have never been denied a contract renewal from a state in which we do business the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve 

  

   

states 

  

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our customerfocused approach to working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

  

   

member programs and services 

  

we recognize the importance of memberfocused delivery of quality managed care services our locally based staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

  

   

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

  

   

   

   

   

providers 

  

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of december 31 2005 our health plans contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals 

  

   

the primary care physician is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obgyns specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians 

  

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs in addition we are governed by state prompt payment policies our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

  

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

  

   

   

   

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the connections epsdt case management and disease management programs for example the connections staff facilitate doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

  

we provide access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a capitated or feeforservice arrangement 

  

   

   

where appropriate our health plans utilize cenpatico to provide behavioral health services we also contract with thirdparty providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy home healthcare vision care diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit in our health plans where prescription and limited overthecounter drugs are a covered benefit we have feeforservice arrangements with national pharmacy vendors that provide a pharmacy network beginning in 2006 we intend to move our pharmacy network to us script the pbm we acquired in january 2006 

  

quality management 

  

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including disease management and complex case management that are 

  

finetuned for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

  

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system as sources to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

  

   

   

   

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 

  

in order to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

  

management information systems 

  

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems which are located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate internal growth and growth from acquisitions we have the ability to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

  

our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner as needed 

  

we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan 

  

specialty services 

  

our specialty services segment is a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complements our core medicaid managed care business the specialty services diversify our revenue stream provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others and effectively control costs our specialty services are provided primarily through the following interrelated businesses 

  

   

   

   

   

   

corporate compliance 

  

our corporate ethics and compliance program was first established in 1998 and provides methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and helps assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

  

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services 

  

our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and 

  

procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations the audit committee and the board of directors review a full compliance report including an incident log on a quarterly basis 

  

competition 

  

in our business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations 

  

   

   

   

we will continue to face varying levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations already in our service areas to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market the licensing requirements and bidding and contracting procedures in some states in the absence of specific healthcare experience however present barriers to entry into the medicaid managed healthcare industry 

  

we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure 

  

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 

  

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities 

  

financial information 

  

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories our managed care subsidiaries in indiana kansas texas and wisconsin have revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2005 other financial information about our segments is found in note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

regulation 

  

our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

  

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

  

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is lengthy and involved and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

  

states have adopted a number of new regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

  

   

   

   

   

state contracts 

  

in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state

our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth in great detail the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to 

  

   

a health plan’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports 

  

hipaa 

  

in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims among the main requirements of hipaa are standards for the processing of health insurance claims and related transactions 

  

the regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted under the hipaa regulations health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

  

hipaa regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations including educating and training for employees in addition the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as 

  

resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have among numerous other requirements the privacy regulations 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

in 2003 hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information compliance was required by april 2005 these rules require healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits in addition numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 

  

patients’ rights legislation 

  

the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in june and august 2001 respectively both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no such federal legislation has been enacted patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

  

other fraud and abuse laws 

  

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources

 item 1a risk factors 

  

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

  

risks related to being a regulated entity 

  

reduction in medicaid schip and ssi funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

  

most of our revenues come from medicaid schip and ssi premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid 

  

schip and ssi funding and premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints for example in august 2004 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms proposed a rule that would have required states to estimate improper payments made under their medicaid and schip programs report such overpayments to congress and if necessary take actions to reduce erroneous payments in october 2005 cms announced an interim rule under which a cms contractor will randomly select states for review once every three years to estimate each state’s rate of erroneous payments the federal share of which the states will be required to return to cms 

  

in february 2005 the bush administration called for changes in medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs and give states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits the bush administration has also proposed to reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 10 billion over the next five years and both the house of representatives and the senate have approved budget bills containing medicaid reductions some states including texas have been authorized to implement special measures to accommodate the arrival of large numbers of beneficiaries from gulf coast areas evacuated as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita but it is unknown whether these measures will be sufficient to cover the additional medicaid costs incurred by these states the newly effective medicare prescription drug benefit is interrupting prescription drug coverage for many medicaid beneficiaries prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from medicaid 

  

changes to medicaid schip and ssi programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid schip and ssi in recent years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid schip and ssi costs and eligibility we believe that reductions in medicaid schip and ssi payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

  

if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

  

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid ssi and schip we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate the contracts expire on various dates between june 30 2006 and august 31 2008 our contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory agencies in addition the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially affected 

  

changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

  

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than stockholders changes in existing laws and rules the enactment of new laws and rules or changing interpretations of these laws and rules could among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

for example congress has considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and such legislation is frequently proposed in congress we cannot predict the impact of this legislation if adopted on our business 

  

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

  

our texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels similarly our new jersey plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event its health benefits ratio is less than 80 these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues the states of indiana new jersey and texas have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results 

  

in recent years cms has reduced the rates at which states are permitted to reimburse nonstate governmentowned or operated hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital services with the upper payment limit decreasing to 100 of medicare payments for comparable services any further reductions in this limit could decrease the profitability of our health plans 

  

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

  

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid ssi and schip programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business for example failure to pay our providers promptly could result in the imposition of fines and other penalties in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse further hipaa imposes civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

  

we may incur significant increased costs as a result of compliance with new government regulations and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 

  

the issuance of future judicial or regulatory guidance regarding the interpretation of regulations the states’ ability to promulgate stricter rules and continuing uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations’ implementation may make compliance with this regulatory landscape difficult for example our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with recent security regulations in order to comply with new regulatory requirements we were required to employ additional or different programs and systems further compliance with new regulations could require additional changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the new regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange or the nyse have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these new compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

  

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

  

changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 

  

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for medicaid reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage more generally we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

  

if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

  

states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for twoyear periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal 

  

process if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state’s application for renewal membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 

  

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

  

the bush administration has proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive instead of federal matching funds combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm healthcare for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

in april 2004 the bush administration adopted a new policy that seeks to reduce states’ use of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers as part of states’ medicaid contributions this policy if continued may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

  

in february 2005 the bush administration called for changes in medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs and give states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits the administration has also proposed to reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by 10 billion over the next five years and both the house and the senate have approved budget bills containing medicaid reductions some states including texas have been authorized to implement special measures to accommodate the arrival of large numbers of beneficiaries from gulf coast areas evacuated as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita but it is unknown whether these measures will be sufficient to cover the additional medicaid costs incurred by these states any reduction or reconfiguration of state funding could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

  

recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 revised costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states’ medicaid programs which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance the new medicare prescription drug benefit is interrupting the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services 

  

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

  

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be limited 

  

schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

  

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

  

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

  

risks related to our business 

  

ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 

  

our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible clients into the health plans the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible clients into health plans or chooses new contractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 

  

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 

  

our medical expenses include estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr medical expenses we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if necessary are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

  

receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

  

nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed 

  

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 

  

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

  

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

  

historically the acquisition of medicaid businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

  

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities 

  

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

  

   

   

   

   

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

  

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

  

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in 2005 for example we 

  

acquired airlogix inc a disease management company in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

  

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

  

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

  

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

  

operations in arizona indiana kansas missouri new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative actions economic conditions and similar factors in those states our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

  

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

  

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

  

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

  

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

  

if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed 

  

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

  

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

  

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

  

changes in stock option accounting rules may have a significant adverse affect on our operating results 

  

we have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options that would result in expense recognition for all options granted or using an intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” or apb 25 with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method we have previously elected to apply apb 25 and accordingly we generally have not recognized any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 123 revised 2004 “share based payment” sfas123r which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value in april 2005 the sec delayed the implementation until the first annual period beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to and will adopt sfas 123r on january 1 2006 the effect of expensing stock options in accordance with the original sfas 123 is presented in note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

  

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and operating results could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

  

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 

  

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 

  

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

  

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

  

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

  

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

  

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could cause our operating results and stock prices to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

  

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

  

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

  

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

  

we intend to expand our medicaid managed care business primarily into markets where medicaid recipients are required to enroll in managed care plans 

  

we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid enrollment in managed care is mandatory currently the majority of states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in all or a portion of their counties the programs are voluntary in other states because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment we expect the geographic expansion of our medicaid managed care segment to be limited to those states 

  

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

  

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

  

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

  

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

  

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from timetotime states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

  

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

  

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing the discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including those set forth under item 1a risk factors of this form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a multiline healthcare enterprise operating in two segments our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaidrelated programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid supplemental security income ssi and the state children’s health insurance program schip our specialty services segment operates through contracts with our health plans as well as other healthcare organizations state programs and other commercial organizations these specialty services include behavioral health disease management nurse triage and treatment compliance effective january 2006 our specialty services also include pharmacy benefits management through our acquisition of us script inc 

  

our 2005 financial highlights include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

over the last 2 years we have experienced strong growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 78 highlights of our growth include the following acquisitions or new contracts 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we have also experienced growth in our specialty services segment highlighted by the following acquisitions or new contracts 

  

   

   

   

   

results of operations and key metrics 

  

summarized comparative financial data for 2005 2004 and 2003 are as follows  in millions 

  

   

revenues and revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues in our medicaid managed care segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members some contracts allow for additional premium related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these adjustments are immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

  

we generate revenues in our specialty services segment under contracts with states and local government entities our health plans and thirdparty customers revenues are recognized when the services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services for performancebased contracts we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance such amounts are recorded as unearned revenue 

  

premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

we have increased our total revenue each year primarily through 1 membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment 2 premium rate increases and 3 growth in our specialty services segment 

  

1 membership growth 

  

from december 31 2003 to december 31 2005 we increased our membership by 781 the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment 

  

   

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment 

  

   

in 2005 we increased our membership in ohio through our acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of summacare inc our membership increased in indiana new jersey and wisconsin from additions to our provider networks expansion into ssi in wisconsin increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries in kansas we increased our membership by eliminating a ceiling on our membership total with the state our membership decreased in missouri and texas because of more stringent eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs 

  

in 2004 we entered the kansas and missouri markets through our acquisition of firstguard and the ohio market with our acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of fhp we increased our texas membership by approximately 87500 members from the epo contract award effective september 1 2004 our membership increased in indiana and wisconsin from additions to our provider network increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries 

  

2 premium rate increases 

  

in 2005 we received premium rate increases ranging from 06 to 87 or 32 on a composite basis across our markets in 2004 we received premium rate increases ranging from 23 to 53 or 44 on a composite basis across our markets 

  

3 specialty services segment growth 

  

in 2005 we began performing under our behavioral health contracts with the states of arizona and kansas at december 31 2005 our behavioral health company cenpatico provided behavioral health services to 94700 members in arizona 38800 members in kansas and 702100 members through contracts with our health plans compared to 584500 members through contracts with our health plans at december 31 2004 additionally in july 2005 we began offering disease management services through our acquisition of airlogix 

  

operating expenses 

  

medical costs 

  

our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

  

our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category 

  

   

our medicaid and schip hbr increased in 2005 due to our settlement of a lawsuit with aurora health care inc which increased our ratio by 03 and expansion into new markets previously unmanaged by us which increased our ratio by 12 for example we experienced higher cost trends in indiana where we added membership in 2005 as the state expanded their medicaid managed care program to include all medicaid and schip enrollees our specialty services ratio includes the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas and reflects the state of arizona’s minimum hbr requirements 

  

our medicaid and schip hbr decreased in 2004 from 2003 due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate emergency room usage and to establish preferred drug lists 

  

cost of services 

  

our cost of services expenses include all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses primarily consist of the salaries and wages of the physicians clinicians therapists and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide services 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

our general and administrative ga expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to health plans specialty companies and our centralized functions that support all of our business units our major centralized functions are finance information systems and claims processing premium taxes are classified as ga expenses ga expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth especially in arizona georgia kansas and missouri 

  

our ga expense ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratios by business segment and in total 

  

   

the decrease in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2005 reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues and lower compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans these factors were partially offset by implementation costs in georgia of 62 million higher spending on information systems process improvements and increased charitable contributions premium taxes totaled 98 million in 2005 increasing the ratio by 05 

  

the increase in the medicaid managed care ga expense ratio in 2004 reflects the impact of premium taxes enacted in september 2003 in texas and july 2004 in new jersey these taxes totaled 55 million in 2004 and 14 million in 2003 and had the effect of increasing our ga expense ratio by 05 in 2004 and 02 in 2003 additionally the 2004 results include 1 startup costs associated with the texas epo contract our claims processing facility in montana and firstguard 2 severance costs related to job eliminations and 3 higher compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans 

  

the specialty services ga ratio varies depending on the nature of the services provided and will have a higher general and administrative expense ratio than the medicaid managed care segment the 2005 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona including 15 million in implementation costs and 02 million in georgia implementation costs the 2004 results were affected by expenses associated with transitioning certain activities within specialty services including closing costs of our clinic facilities in texas and california as cenpatico fully transitioned to a thirdparty service model for behavioral health services due diligence costs related to a potential transaction we decided not to pursue and costs related to investing in new business opportunities 

  

other income expense 

  

other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments and interest expense on our debt investment and other income increased 42 million in 2005 as a result of higher average investment balances and an increase in market interest rates interest expense increased 33 million from increased borrowings under our credit facility and mortgages 

  

income tax expense 

  

our effective tax rate in 2005 was 352 compared to 370 in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a lower state income tax expense resulting from the resolution of state income tax examinations and the recognition of deferred tax benefits related to a change in law during the third quarter of 2005 this change was recorded in our operating results in the period known 

  

earnings per share and shares outstanding 

  

our earnings per share calculations in 2005 reflect higher basic weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued upon exercise of stock awards and the shares issued for the acquisition of assets from summacare inc our earnings per share calculations in 2004 reflect an increase in the weighted average shares primarily resulting from 6900000 common shares sold in august 2003 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our operating activities provided cash of 740 million in 2005 994 million in 2004 and 560 million in 2003 cash flow from operations in 2005 reflects an increase in premium and related receivables and a 45 million increase in medical claims liabilities the increase in receivables resulted primarily from the timing of delivery receivable collections the increase in medical claims liabilities lower than in prior years reflects the 95 million payment made to aurora health care inc to settle a lawsuit information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona during 2004 the increase in operating cash flow was due primarily to continued profitability increases in membership and increases in medical claims liabilities 

  

our investing activities used cash of 564 million in 2005 1225 million in 2004 and 1407 million in 2003 during 2005 our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of airlogix and certain medicaidrelated assets of summacare inc approximately 341 million was paid net of cash acquired for airlogix of the total purchase price of approximately 304 million paid to summacare 214 million was paid in cash and the remaining 90 million was paid through the issuance of our common stock during 2004 our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisition of firstguard in 2003 the largest component of investing activities related to increases in our investment portfolio as a result of our stock offering our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2005 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 16 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds corporate bonds insurance contracts commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 

  

we spent 269 million 147 million and 66 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of new software software and hardware upgrades and furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions we anticipate spending 43 million on additional capital expenditures in 2006 primarily related to market expansions and system upgrades and approximately 20 million for the acquisition of additional property related to our redevelopment agreement discussed below 

  

effective december 30 2005 we executed an agreement with the city of clayton missouri a suburb of st louis for the redevelopment of certain properties surrounding our corporate offices our primary purpose for the agreement is to accommodate office expansion needs for future company growth the total scope of the project includes building two new office towers and streetlevel retail space we plan to occupy a portion of those towers the total expected cost of the project is approximately 190 million it is not our intent to serve as developer of the project we expect a commercial real estate developer to fund the majority of the project cost 

  

during 2005 we acquired 50 million of property under capital leases this property consists primarily of the land and building related to our new claims processing facility in montana during 2004 we purchased the property adjacent to our corporate headquarters in st louis missouri for an aggregate purchase price of 103 million this property is being used for the expansion of our corporate offices we financed a portion of the purchase price through a 55 million nonrecourse mortgage loan arrangement in july 2003 we purchased the building in which our corporate headquarters is located for an aggregate purchase price of 126 million we financed a portion of the purchase price through an 80 million nonrecourse mortgage loan arrangement the mortgage agreements bear interest at the prevailing prime rate less 75 at december 31 2005 our mortgages bore interest at 65 

  

our financing activities provided cash of 457 million in 2005 428 million in 2004 and 894 million in 2003 during 2005 and 2004 our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our 

  

credit facility these borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction with the acquisition of new business during 2003 our financing cash flows primarily consisted of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our public offering completed in august 2003 

  

at december 31 2005 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 580 million as compared to 221 million at december 31 2004 our working capital is sometimes negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital we manage our shortterm and longterm investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund shortterm capital requirements as needed 

  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 2041 million at december 31 2005 and 1784 million at december 31 2004 longterm investments were 1462 million at december 31 2005 and 1390 million at december 31 2004 including restricted deposits of 226 million and 222 million respectively at december 31 2005 cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 277 million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled 3226 million 

  

on september 9 2005 we executed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement dated september 14 2004 with several lending institutions for which lasalle bank national association serves as administrative agent and colead arranger the amendment increased the total amount available under the credit agreement to 200 million from 100 million including a subfacility for letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to 50 million in addition the lending institutions released our prior grant of a security interest in the outstanding common stock and membership interests of each of our subsidiaries the credit agreement is now an unsecured facility borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate under our current capital structure borrowings under the agreement bear interest at libor plus 125 this rate may change under differing capital structures over the life of the agreement the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios maximum debttoebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth the agreement will expire on september 9 2010 or on an earlier date in the instance of a default as defined in the agreement as of february 23 2006 we had 1090 million in borrowings outstanding under the agreement and 150 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving an availability of 760 million as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all covenants 

  

we have filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the securities and exchange commission or the sec covering the issuance of up to 300 million of securities including common stock and debt securities no securities have been issued under the shelf registration we may publicly offer securities from timetotime at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 

  

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

  

our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2005 consisted of medical claims liabilities debt operating leases and purchase obligations our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facility mortgages and capital leases the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts in addition to agreements pertaining to the expansion of our corporate headquarters the contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

  

   

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

as managed care organizations certain of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 

  

as of december 31 2005 our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 1835 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 877 million 

  

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2005 our georgia indiana new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin health plans were in compliance with riskbased capital requirements enacted in these states if adopted by kansas or missouri riskbased capital requirements may increase the minimum capital required for these subsidiaries we continue to monitor the requirements in kansas and missouri and do not expect that they will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows acquisitions in new states or new markets in existing states may require additional capital funding for our regulated subsidiaries 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “share based payment” sfas 123r sfas 123r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions sfas 123r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using optionpricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award we will adopt sfas 123r on january 1 2006 using the modifiedprospective method and expect the 2006 effect to decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately 015 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 

  

medical claims liabilities 

  

our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid inventory estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 

  

our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates in developing our estimate for ibnr we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

the completion factor claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2005 data 

  

   

    

while we believe our estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by 11 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

  

the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands 

  

   

   

acquisitions in 2004 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of firstguard acquisitions in 2003 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of uhp 

  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 5 of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december 31 2005 will be known by the end of 2006 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development including changes in medical utilization and cost trends these changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our “margin protection” programs and changes in our member demographics for all of our membership we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer to as our “margin protection” programs that assist with the control of medical utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies while we try to predict the savings from these programs actual savings have proven to be better than anticipated which has contributed to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 

  

intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions since 2003 that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights provider contracts noncompete agreements and 

  

goodwill at december 31 2005 we have 1573 million of goodwill and 174 million of other intangible assets purchased contract rights are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from 5 to 15 years provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over 5 years the period of the agreement 

  

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors these factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts we did not recognize any impairment losses during the three years ended december 31 2005 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this filing contains forwardlooking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including “believe” “anticipate” “plan” “expect” “estimate” “intend” “seek” “goal” “may” “will” “should” “can” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements include statements about our market opportunity our growth strategy competition expected activities and future acquisitions investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources these statements may be found in item 1 “business” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” readers are cautioned that matters subject to forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including economic regulatory competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors including the factors set forth in item 1a “risk factors” our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses a variety of factors including competition changes in healthcare practices changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations inflation provider contract changes new technologies governmentimposed surcharges taxes or assessments reduction in provider payments by governmental payers major epidemics disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare such as major healthcare providers’ inability to maintain their operations may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses once set premiums are generally fixed for oneyear periods and accordingly unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums the expiration cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively affect us due to these factors and risks we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had shortterm investments of 567 million and longterm investments of 1462 million including restricted deposits of 226 million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts and us treasury investments and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2005 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 31 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

  

inflation 

  

although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 

  

compliance costs 

  

federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued in recent years due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted implementation of additional systems and programs may be required further compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

industry 

  

established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states providing health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title xix of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs—one for each state each territory and the district of columbia the national association of state budget officers estimates the total medicaid market was approximately 310 billion in 2004 and the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms estimate the market will grow to over 400 billion by fiscal year 2007 medicaid eligibility is based on a combination of income and asset requirements subject to federal guidelines often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level the number of persons covered by medicaid increased from 23 million in 1989 to over 50 million in 2003 historically children have represented the largest eligibility group 

  

ssi beneficiaries receive the majority of their healthcare needs through medicaid ssi beneficiaries are people with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments state medicaid expenditures related to the ssi population represent a growing percentage of all medicaid related expenses 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earn too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid and some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs 

  

costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics obgyn and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population additionally behavioral health issues represent a growing component of total medicaid expenditures 

  

while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who could not afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tend to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 

  

since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives continued pressure on states’ medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality health care and effectively controlling costs a growing number of states including each of the seven states in which we operate have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans currently 42 states have mandated managed care for some or all of their medicaid recipients and other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach 

  

in addition several states have initiated specialized programs that focus on specific chronic diseases often chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma can be treated more successfully and efficiently when a comprehensive treatment plan is properly executed such a plan includes not only timely and appropriate medical care but requires that the patient maintain an appropriate diet and exercise regimen take medicines as prescribed keep appointments with doctors and monitor their health status 

  

historically commercial managed care organizations contracted with states to provide healthcare benefits to medicaid enrollees many of these organizations encountered difficulties in adapting their commercial approaches and infrastructures to address the medicaid market in a costeffective manner some commercial plans have chosen to exit all or a portion of their medicaid markets as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the medicaid ssi and schip populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 

  

our approach 

  

our multiline managed care approach is based on the following key attributes 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our strategy 

  

our objective is to become the leading multiline medicaid and medicaidrelated managed care organization we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

   

medicaid managed care 

  

health plans 

  

we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in indiana kansas missouri new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin we have never been denied a contract renewal from a state in which we do business the table below provides summary data for the markets we currently serve 

  

   

states 

  

our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs and from our customerfocused approach to working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are 

  

   

member programs and services 

  

we recognize the importance of memberfocused services in the delivery of quality managed care services our locally based staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services 

  

   

we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner 

  

   

   

   

   

providers 

  

for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of january 31 2005 our health plans had the following numbers of physicians and hospitals 

  

   

the primary care physician is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obgyns specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians 

  

we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs in addition we adhere to a prompt payment policy our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 

  

we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members the following are among the services we provide to support physicians 

  

   

   

   

our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the connections epsdt case management and disease management programs for example the connections staff facilitate doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 

  

we provide access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days’ prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a capitated or feeforservice arrangement 

  

   

   

some of our health plans utilize cenpatico to provide behavioral health services we also contract with ancillary providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy mental health and chemical dependency care home healthcare vision care diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit in our health plans where prescription and limited overthecounter drugs are a covered benefit we have a feeforservice arrangement with a national pharmacy vendor that provides a pharmacy network 

  

quality management 

  

our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including disease management and complex case management that are finetuned for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 

  

we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system as sources to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include 

  

   

   

   

we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team additionally during 2004 cenpatico received full accreditation under the health plan standards of the utilization review accreditation committee also known as urac the accreditation is effective january 1 2005 through january 1 2007 

  

in order to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

  

management information systems 

  

the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate internal growth and growth from acquisitions we have the ability to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

  

this integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner as needed 

  

we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan 

  

specialty services 

  

in 2003 we entered the specialty services market our specialty services are provided primarily through the following interrelated businesses 

  

   

   

   

   

our entry into the behavioral health field allows us to continue to offer solutions to the states in which we have health plans as well as other states where behavioral health for medicaid recipients has been underserved 

  

corporate compliance 

  

our corporate ethics and compliance programs were first established in 1998 and provide methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do 

  

the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services 

  

our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations of our corporate compliance program the audit committee and the board of directors review the incident log on a quarterly basis 

  

competition 

  

in the medicaid business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations 

  

   

   

   

we will continue to face varying levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations already in our service areas to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market the licensing requirements and bidding and contracting procedures in some states however present barriers to entry into the medicaid managed healthcare industry 

  

we compete with other managed care organizations for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure 

  

we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 

  

we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities 

  

competition for specialty services consists of specialized programs that focus on specific chronic diseases and are often administered by companies that developed comprehensive care guidelines and patient support services appropriate to each specific disease or disorder high cost and highrisk conditions offer the best return on investment in these programs and a number of companies compete for these contracts managed care organizations have long had disease specific initiatives but such programs are now offered by pharmacy benefit managers pharmaceutical makers and a number of specialty companies 

  

financial information 

  

all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states our managed care subsidiaries in indiana new jersey texas and wisconsin have revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of consolidated revenues in 2004 other financial information about our segments is found in note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

regulation 

  

our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 

  

our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations andor insurance companies in their respective states in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 

  

the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is lengthy and involved and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas 

  

states have adopted a number of new regulations that may affect our business and results of operations these regulations in certain states include 

  

   

   

   

   

medicaid

the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in june and august 2001 respectively both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no version of this type of federal legislation has yet to become law patients’ rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take 

  

other fraud and abuse laws 

  

investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources

we have organized this management’s discussion and analysis to address the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

recent acquisitions 

  

effective december 1 2004 we acquired firstguard inc and firstguard health plan inc or firstguard for a purchase price of approximately 961 million firstguard serves approximately 135000 members in kansas and missouri the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning december 1 2004 the preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in estimated identifiable intangible assets of 80 million and goodwill of 868 million the estimated identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated life of ten years 

  

effective january 1 2004 we commenced operations in ohio through the acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of family health plan inc for a purchase price of 69 million we are currently serving 23800 members in toledo ohio the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january 1 2004 the purchase price allocation resulted in identified intangible assets of 18 million representing purchased contract rights provider network and a noncompete agreement and goodwill of 51 million the contract rights provider network and noncompete agreement are being amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 

  

effective august 1 2003 we acquired the medicaidrelated contract rights of hmo blue texas in the san antonio texas market this transaction allows us to serve approximately 17000 additional members in the state the purchase price of 10 million was allocated to acquired contracts the contracts are being amortized over a period of five years the expected period of benefit 

  

during 2003 we acquired a 100 ownership interest in group practice affiliates llc a behavioral healthcare services company 637 in march 2003 and 363 in august 2003 in september 2004 we renamed this subsidiary cenpatico behavioral health llc or cenpatico this acquisition is consistent with our 

  

strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population we paid an aggregate purchase price of 18 million for cenpatico assumed net liabilities of 19 million and recorded goodwill of 37 million related to the acquisition 

  

in march 2003 we purchased certain assets of scriptassist a treatment compliance company we are administering the purchased contracts under the scriptassist name scriptassist uses various approaches and medical expertise to promote adherence to prescription drugs the asset acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population the purchase price of 563000 was allocated to acquired contracts we are amortizing the contracts over five years the expected period of benefit 

  

on december 1 2002 we acquired 80 of the outstanding capital stock of university health plans inc or uhp from university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in october 2003 we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 20 uhp is a managed health plan operating in 20 counties in new jersey we paid an aggregate purchase price of 133 million for our interest in uhp the purchase price allocation resulted in intangible assets of 38 million representing provider contracts and purchased contract rights which are being amortized over 10 years and goodwill of 50 million 

  

in june 2002 we entered into an agreement with texas universities health plan inc to purchase the schip contracts in three texas service areas thereby adding approximately 24000 members to our texas health plan the cash purchase price of 595000 was recorded as purchased contract rights which are being amortized over five years the expected period of benefit 

  

with our acquisition of cenpatico and our purchase of scriptassist assets we began operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services the medicaid managed care segment consists of our regulated subsidiaries including all of the functions needed to operate them the specialty services segment consists of our specialty services including our behavioral health nurse triage and treatment compliance functions 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 3 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 

  

medical claims liabilities 

  

our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 

  

our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates in developing our estimate for ibnr we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated for more recent periods incurred noninpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors for older periods we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 

  

the completion factor claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2004 data 

  

   

    

while we believe these estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by 10 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

  

the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands 

  

   

   

acquisitions in 2004 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of firstguard acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of uhp 

  

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 10 of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december 31 2004 will be known by the end of 2005 

  

actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate in many situations the claims amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

  

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development in all of our markets including changes in medical utilization and cost trends these changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our “margin protection” programs and changes in our member demographics for example our membership increased 383 during the fourth quarter of 2002 this member growth led to changes in our medical utilization and cost trends that were subject to estimates at december 31 2002 for all of our membership we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer to as our “margin protection” programs that assist with the control of medical utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies while we try to predict the savings from these programs actual savings have proven to be better than anticipated which has contributed to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 

  

intangible assets 

  

we have made several acquisitions since 2002 that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements purchased contract rights provider contracts and goodwill at december 31 2004 we have outstanding 1016 million of goodwill and 144 million of net other intangible assets noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over 60 months purchased contract rights are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from 60 to 120 months provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over 120 months 

  

our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor future utility and other internal and external factors in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

  

goodwill is reviewed at each yearend for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors these factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts we did not recognize any impairment losses during the three years ended december 31 2004 

  

revenue and expense discussion and key metrics 

  

revenues and revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues in our medicaid managed care segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to provide health benefits to our members we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data these adjustments are immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known typically within two months 

  

our specialty services companies generate revenues from a variety of sources our behavioral health company generates revenue via capitation payments from our health plans and others it also receives fees for the direct provision of care and certain school programs in arizona our treatment compliance program receives fee income from the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals our nurse triage line receives fees from health plans physicians and other organizations for providing continuous access to nurse advisors 

  

premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premiums due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive premiums during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total premium revenue and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

the primary drivers of our increasing revenue have been membership growth in our medicaid managed care segment we have increased our membership through internal growth and acquisitions from december 31 2002 to december 31 2004 we increased our membership by 886 the following table sets forth our membership by state 

  

   

the following table sets forth our membership by line of business 

  

   

in 2004 we entered the kansas and missouri markets through our acquisition of firstguard and the ohio market with our acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of family health plan inc we increased our texas membership by approximately 87500 members from the epo contract award effective september 1 2004 our membership increased in indiana and wisconsin from additions to our provider network increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries 

  

in 2003 our membership increased by 17000 members in texas due to the purchase of contract rights from hmo blue texas our membership increased in all our markets from additions to our provider network increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries 

  

in 2002 our membership increased by 24000 members in texas due to the purchase of schip contract rights from texas universities health plan in addition two smaller plans exited the austin texas market as a result our texas plan increased its membership by 28000 members this increase includes approximately 12000 members that we managed for the state of texas on an interim basis we entered the new jersey market through our acquisition of uhp membership increases in our wisconsin and indiana markets resulted from additions to our provider network and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries 

  

operating expenses 

  

our operating expenses include medical costs cost of services and general and administrative expenses 

  

our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty product claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 

  

our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our health benefits ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our health benefits ratios by member category and in total 

  

   

our medicaid and schip ratio decreased in 2004 from 2003 due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate emergency room usage and to establish preferred drug lists such as generics the addition of the ssi members resulting from our acquisition in new jersey in december 2002 caused our total health benefits ratio to increase slightly in 2003 the health benefits ratio for ssi is affected by a low membership base and is subject to greater volatility as a percentage of premiums although relatively immaterial in total dollars to total medical costs 

  

our cost of services expenses include all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses primarily consist of the salaries and wages of the physicians clinicians therapists and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide services 

  

our general and administrative expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to health plans specialty companies and our centralized functions that support all of our business units the major centralized functions are claims processing information systems and finance premium taxes are classified as general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expense ratio represents 

  

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to drive those revenues the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratios by business segment and in total 

  

   

the increase in the medicaid managed care general and administrative expenses ratio in 2004 reflects the impact of premium taxes enacted in september 2003 in texas and july 2004 in new jersey these taxes totaled 55 million in 2004 and 14 in 2003 and had the effect of increasing our general and administrative expenses ratio by 05 in 2004 and 02 in 2003 additionally the 2004 results include 1 startup costs associated with the texas epo contract our claims processing facility in montana and firstguard 2 severance costs related to job eliminations and 3 higher compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans 

  

the specialty services ratio may vary depending on the various contracts and nature of the services provided and will have a higher general and administrative expense ratio than the medicaid managed care segment the 2004 results were affected by expenses associated with transitioning certain activities within specialty services including closing costs of our clinic facilities in texas and california as cenpatico fully transitions to a thirdparty service model for behavioral health services due diligence costs related to a potential transaction we decided not to pursue and costs related to investing in new business opportunities 

  

other income expense 

  

other income expense consists principally of investment and other income and interest expense

revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 300 from the comparable period in 2003 this increase was due to organic growth in our existing markets the addition of epo members in texas effective september 1 2004 the acquisition of the medicaid related assets of family health plan effective january 1 2004 and the acquisition of firstguard effective december 1 2004 additionally we received premium rate increases ranging from 23 to 53 or 44 on a composite basis across our markets 

  

operating expenses 

  

medical costs increased 278 due to the growth in our membership as discussed above our health benefits ratio decreased to 807 from 824 primarily due to continued improvements in our initiatives to reduce emergency room usage and to establish preferred drug lists throughout all our markets 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 448 primarily due to expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth expansion into the specialty services segment the effect of a premium tax in two states and startup costs related to our acquisition of firstguard the epo contract and our claims processing facility in montana 

  

other income 

  

investment and other income increased 158 as a result of higher average investment balances and an increase in market interest rates partially offset by higher interest expense from increased borrowings under our credit facility and mortgages 

  

income tax expense 

  

our effective tax rate in 2004 was 370 compared to 376 in 2003 the decrease was primarily due to a lower effective state tax rate 

  

earnings per share and shares outstanding 

  

our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2004 primarily resulting from the followon offering of 6900000 common shares sold in august 2003 

  

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

  

summarized comparative financial data for 2003 and 2002 are as follows  in millions

services revenues increased due to an increase in our nonrisk ssi membership in our texas market and the addition of services revenues of cenpatico beginning march 1 2003 

  

operating expenses 

  

medical costs increased 650 due to the growth in our membership as discussed above our medicaid and schip health benefits ratio decreased to 817 from 822 due in part to our initiatives to reduce emergency room usage and to establish preferred drug lists 

  

cost of services increased due to the inclusion of direct costs related to the services revenues of cenpatico beginning march 1 2003 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 763 primarily due to expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth and expansion into the specialty services segment additionally general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the institution of a premium tax tax planning costs incurred during the year and ohio startup costs 

  

other income 

  

other income expense in 2002 included a onetime dividend of 51 million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment excluding this onetime gain other income increased from 2002 with higher investment balances in 2003 partially offset by a lower interest rate environment and interest expense on our corporate headquarters’ mortgage 

  

income tax expense 

  

our effective tax rate in 2003 was 376 compared to 380 in 2002 the decrease was primarily due to increased levels of taxexempt interest income and a lower effective state tax rate 

  

earnings per share and shares outstanding 

  

our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2003 primarily resulting from the followon offering of 6900000 common shares sold in august 2003 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our operating activities provided cash of 994 million in 2004 560 million in 2003 and 397 million in 2002 the increases were due primarily to continued profitability increases in membership and increases in medical claims liabilities 

  

our investing activities used cash of 1225 million in 2004 1407 million in 2003 and 797 million in 2002 during 2004 our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisition of firstguard in 2003 and 2002 the largest component of investing activities related to increases in our investment portfolio as a result of our stock offerings in those years our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2004 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 18 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds corporate bonds insurance contracts commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 

  

our financing activities provided cash of 428 million in 2004 894 million in 2003 and 108 million in 2002 during 2004 our financing activities primarily consisted of borrowings under our credit facility these borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction with the acquisition of firstguard during 2003 our financing cash flows primarily consisted of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our public offering completed in august 2003 during 2002 financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our offering completed in june 2002 

  

we spent 147 million and 66 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of new software software and hardware upgrades and furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions in 2002 we purchased 39 million of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements we anticipate spending 168 million on additional capital expenditures in 2005 related to office and market expansions and system upgrades 

  

during 2004 we purchased the property adjacent to our corporate headquarters in st louis missouri for an aggregate purchase price of 103 million this property will be used for the future expansion of our corporate offices we financed a portion of the purchase price through a 55 million nonrecourse mortgage loan arrangement in july 2003 we purchased the building in which our corporate headquarters is located for an aggregate purchase price of 126 million we financed a portion of the purchase price through an 80 million nonrecourse mortgage loan arrangement during 2004 we renewed this mortgage at the original principal amount of 80 million the mortgage agreements bear interest at the prevailing prime rate less 25 at december 31 2004 our mortgages bore interest at 50 

  

at december 31 2004 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 221 million as compared to 185 million at december 31 2003 our working capital is sometimes negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm our investment policies are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital we manage our shortterm and longterm investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund working capital as needed 

  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1784 million at december 31 2004 and 795 million at december 31 2003 longterm investments were 1390 million at december 31 2004 and 2052 million at december 31 2003 including restricted deposits of 222 million and 204 million respectively cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 460 million and 1267 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

in september 2004 we executed a fiveyear 100 million revolving credit agreement with various financial institutions and lasalle bank national association as administrative agent and arranger borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates the federal funds rate or the prime rate the agreement is secured by the common stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries the agreement contains nonfinancial and financial covenants including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum debttoebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth the agreement will expire in september 2009 or on an earlier date in the instance of a default as defined in the agreement in conjunction with this agreement we cancelled our prior existing 50 million credit facility as of december 31 2004 we had 34 million outstanding under the agreement and were in compliance with all covenants 

  

in january 2005 we executed a definitive agreement subject to regulatory approvals to acquire the medicaidrelated assets of summacare inc for approximately 31 million plus transaction costs the purchase price will consist of approximately 22 million in cash and 9 million in common stock the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005 

  

based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations the planned acquisition of summacare inc and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing 

  

our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2004 consisted of medical claims liabilities borrowings from our credit facility and mortgages operating leases and purchase obligations the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts in addition to development agreements pertaining to our montana claims facility and the future expansion of our corporate headquarters the contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands 

  

   

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

  

our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2004 our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 1236 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 651 million 

  

the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2004 our indiana ohio texas and wisconsin health plans were in 

  

compliance with riskbased capital requirements enacted in these states if adopted by kansas missouri or new jersey riskbased capital requirements may increase the minimum capital required for these subsidiaries we continue to monitor the requirements in kansas missouri and new jersey and do not expect that they will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows acquisitions in new states or new markets in existing states may require additional capital funding for our regulated subsidiaries 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 sfas no 123 revised 2004 “share based payment” was issued this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions this statement requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using optionpricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award this statement is required to be adopted by july 1 2005 the effect of expensing stock options in accordance with the original sfas no 123 is presented in note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading stock based compensation included elsewhere in this form 10k after the adoption of sfas no 123 revised 2004 the level of stock compensation expense may differ depending on the fair value method and assumptions utilized 

  

in january 2003 fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51” was issued the primary objectives of this interpretation as amended are to provide guidance on the identification and consolidation of variable interest entities or vies which are entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights we have completed an analysis of this interpretation and have determined that we do not have any vies 

  

in november 2002 fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of sfas no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34” was issued this interpretation clarifies the requirements of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” relating to a guarantor’s accounting for and disclosure of the issuance of certain types of guarantees the adoption of fasb interpretation no 45 did not have a significant impact on our net income or equity 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this filing contains forwardlooking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including “believe” “anticipate” “plan” “expect” “estimate” “intend” “seek” “goal” “may” “will” “should” “can” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements include statements about our market opportunity our growth strategy competition expected activities and future acquisitions investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources these statements may be found in the sections of this filing entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “business” readers are cautioned that matters subject to forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including economic regulatory competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses a variety of factors including competition changes in healthcare practices changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations inflation provider contract changes new technologies governmentimposed surcharges taxes or assessments reduction in provider payments by governmental payers major epidemics disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare such as major healthcare providers’ inability to maintain their operations may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses once set premiums are generally fixed for oneyear periods and accordingly unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums the expiration cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively affect us due to these factors and risks we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 

  

factors that may affect future results and the 

trading price of our common stock 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 

  

risks related to being a regulated entity 

  

reduction in medicaid schip and ssi funding could substantially reduce our profitability 

  

most of our revenues come from medicaid schip and ssi premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid schip and ssi funding and premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints for example in august 2004 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms proposed a rule requiring states to estimate improper payments made under their medicaid and schip programs report such overpayments to congress and if 

  

necessary take actions to reduce erroneous payments in february 2005 the bush administration called for changes in medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs and give states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits changes to medicaid schip and ssi programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid schip and ssi over the past two years the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid schip and ssi costs and eligibility we believe that reductions in medicaid schip and ssi payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

  

if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed our business will suffer 

  

we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid ssi and schip we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate the contracts expire on various dates between june 30 2005 and august 31 2007 our contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory agencies in addition the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts are generally intended to run for two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially affected 

  

changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 

  

our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan providers and members rather than stockholders changes in existing laws and rules the enactment of new laws and rules or changing interpretations of these laws and rules could among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

for example congress has considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and the legislation is frequently proposed in congress we cannot predict the impact of this legislation if adopted on our business 

  

regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 

  

our texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels similarly our new jersey plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event its health benefits ratio is less than 80 these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements 

  

by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues the states of indiana new jersey and texas have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results 

  

also on january 18 2002 cms published a final rule that removed a provision contained in the federal medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting states to reimburse nonstate governmentowned or operated hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to 150 of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services furnished by these hospitals under medicaid payment principles the upper payment limit was reduced to 100 of medicare payments for comparable services this development in federal regulation decreased the profitability of our health plans 

  

failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

  

federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid ssi and schip programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business for example failure to pay our providers promptly could result in the imposition of fines and other penalties in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse further hipaa imposes civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

  

we will incur significant increased costs as a result of compliance with new government regulations and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance 

  

on february 20 2003 hhs published the final hipaa health data security regulations compliance with the security regulations is required by april 21 2005 these regulations will require covered entities to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect electronic health information maintained or transmitted by the organization 

  

the issuance of future judicial or regulatory guidance regarding the interpretation of regulations the states’ ability to promulgate stricter rules and continuing uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations’ implementation may make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult for example our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with the new security regulations in order to comply with the regulatory requirements we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems further compliance with these regulations could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the new regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

  

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in particular we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses our compliance with section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

  

changes in healthcare law may reduce our profitability 

  

numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for medicaid and reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services more generally we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

  

if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied our membership in that state will likely decrease 

  

states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for twoyear periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies we have no control over this renewal process if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state’s application for renewal our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 

  

changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 

  

the bush administration has proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive instead of federal matching funds combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm healthcare for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted or if so how it may change from a similar proposal initiated by the bush administration in february 2003 accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

in april 2004 the bush administration adopted a new policy that seeks to reduce states’ use of accounting devices such as intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of medicaid program funding by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers as part of states’ medicaid contributions this policy if continued may restrict some states’ funding for medicaid which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

  

in february 2005 the bush administration called for changes in medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs and give states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits any reduction or reconfiguration of state funding could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

  

recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 enacted in december 2003 will upon taking effect in 2006 revise costsharing requirements for some beneficiaries and require states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states’ medicaid programs which could adversely affect our growth operations and financial performance 

  

if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 

  

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include hmos and managed care organizations or mcos hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additionally state regulatory agencies may require at their discretion individual hmo’s to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be limited 

  

schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

  

if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 

  

we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 

  

risks related to our business 

  

receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

  

nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of 

  

healthcare services delivered to our members if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed 

  

failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 

  

our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses historically our health benefits ratio has fluctuated for example over the last six years our health benefits ratio has ranged from 807 to 889 because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

  

failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 

  

our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr medical expenses we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if necessary are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

  

difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 

  

historically the acquisition of medicaid businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 

  

we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities furthermore our credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the consent of our bank lender 

  

in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of 

  

   

   

   

   

accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

  

if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 

  

we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in 2003 for example we acquired cenpatico behavioral health a behavioral health services company and purchased contract and name rights of scriptassist a treatment compliance company in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

  

failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 

  

startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

  

we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 

  

operations in indiana kansas missouri new jersey ohio texas and wisconsin have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative actions economic conditions and similar factors in those states our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

  

competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 

  

we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 

  

some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 

  

in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

  

if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our provider networks our profitability will be harmed 

  

our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

  

from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

  

we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 

  

if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

  

changes in stock option accounting rules may have a significant adverse affect on our operating results 

  

we have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for 

  

options that would result in expense recognition for all options granted or using an intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” or apb 25 with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method we have previously elected to apply apb 25 and accordingly we generally have not recognized any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “share based payment” which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value this statement is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations we believe however that our adoption of this standard will adversely affect our operating results in future periods 

  

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

  

we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and operating results could be harmed our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

  

negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 

  

the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 

  

claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 

  

our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

  

loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

  

our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level 

  

of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

  

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns could cause our operating results and stock prices to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 

  

less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

  

growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 

  

historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

  

we intend to expand our medicaid managed care business primarily into markets where medicaid recipients are required to enroll in managed care plans 

  

we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid enrollment in managed care is mandatory currently approximately twothirds of the states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in all or a portion of their counties the programs are voluntary in other states because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment we expect the geographic expansion of our medicaid managed care segment to be limited to those states 

  

if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted 

  

our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information 

  

our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

  

we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 

  

premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments from timetotime states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program alternatively a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

  

we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 

  

we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits

as of december 31 2004 we had shortterm investments of 943 million and longterm investments of 1390 million including restricted deposits of 222 million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal corporate and us agency bonds life insurance contracts and us treasury investments and have maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies restricted deposits are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states’ requirements our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2004 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 41 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

  

inflation 

  

although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 

  

while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 

  

compliance costs 

  

federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued recently due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted implementation of additional systems and programs may be required further compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states

 item 1 business tableend overview   we are a multiline managed care organization that provides medicaid and medicaidrelated programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid supplemental security income ssi and the state children’s health insurance program schip in addition we provide specialty services including behavioral health nurse triage and pharmacy compliance to our own and other healthcare organizations we have health plans in wisconsin texas indiana new jersey and ohio and provide specialty services in texas california arizona colorado wisconsin and indiana we believe our local approach to managing our subsidiaries including provider and member services enables us to provide accessible high quality culturallysensitive healthcare services to our communities our disease management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing   we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in 2001 we initially were formed to serve as a holding company for a medicaid managed care line of business that has been operating in wisconsin since 1984 our corporate office is located at 7711 carondelet avenue suite 800 st louis missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477   we maintain a website with the address wwwcentenecom we are not including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this filing we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the sec industry   established in 1965 medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states providing health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities authorized by title ixx of the social security act medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs — one for each state each territory and the district of columbia the congressional budget office cbo estimates the total medicaid market was approximately 270 billion in 2003 and the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services cms estimate the market will grow to over 400 billion by fiscal year 2007 medicaid eligibility is based on a combination of income and asset requirements subject to federal guidelines often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level the number of persons covered by medicaid increased from 23 million in 1989 to 51 million in 2003 historically children have represented the largest eligibility group   ssi covers lowincome aged blind and disabled persons ssi beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients in addition ssi recipients typically utilize more services because of their more critical health issues   the balanced budget act of 1997 created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earn too much to qualify for medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid and some states are expanding their schip coverage to include adults 3   costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics ob gyn and family care these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population additionally behavioral health issues represent a growing component of total medicaid expenditures   while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who could not afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare medicaid recipients typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tend to be more expensive as a result many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory   since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives in recent years a growing number of states including each of the five states in which we operate have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans currently 37 states have mandated managed care for some or all of their medicaid recipients and other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach   in addition several states have initiated specialized programs that focus on specific chronic diseases often chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma can be treated more successfully and efficiently when a comprehensive treatment plan is properly executed such a plan includes not only timely and appropriate medical care but requires that the patient maintain an appropriate diet and exercise regimen take medicines as prescribed keep appointments with doctors and monitor their health status   historically commercial managed care organizations contracted with states to provide healthcare benefits to medicaid enrollees many of these organizations encountered difficulties in adapting their commercial approaches and infrastructures to address the medicaid market in a costeffective manner some commercial plans have chosen to exit all or a portion of their medicaid markets as a result a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the medicaid including ssi and schip populations we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market our approach   our approach to our multiline managed care organization is based on the following key attributes  4  our strategy   our objective is to become the leading multiline medicaid and medicaidrelated managed care organization we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy  5  medicaid managed care health plans   we have five health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in wisconsin texas indiana new jersey and ohio we have never been denied a contract renewal from a state in which we do business the table below provides summary data for the markets we currently serve  6 states   our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs for and our customerfocused approach to working with state governments among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are  member programs and services   we recognize the importance of memberfocused services in the delivery of quality managed care services our locally based staff assist members in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following services    we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner  7  providers   for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as of january 31 2004 our health plans had the following numbers of physicians and hospitals    the primary care physician is a critical component in care delivery management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians internal medicine physicians and obgyns specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians   we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs in addition we adhere to a prompt payment policy our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices   we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members the following are among the services we provide to support physicians    our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members including the connections epsdt case management and disease management programs for example the connections staff facilitate doctorpatient relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease   we provide access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to 8 termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days’ prior written notice in the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a capitated or feeforservice arrangement 

   some of our health plans utilize gpa to provide behavioral health services we also contract with ancillary providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy mental health and chemical dependency care home healthcare vision care diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit in our healthplans where prescription and limited overthecounter drugs are a covered benefit we have a feeforservice arrangement with a national pharmacy vendor that provides a pharmacy network quality management   our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies including disease management and complex case management that are finetuned for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program   we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and amisys as sources to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements some examples of these intervention programs include    additionally we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse state and health employer data and information set or hedis reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team   in order to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance management information systems   the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective manner our centralized information systems located in st louis missouri support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate internal growth and growth from acquisitions 9 we have the ability to leverage the platform we have developed for one state for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 

  this integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans our amisys production system is capable of supporting over one million members   we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by the plan specialty services   in 2003 we entered the specialty services market our specialty services are provided primarily through the following interrelated businesses    currently approximately 6 of our ambulatory care is behavioral health related and will increase as our ssi membership increases our entry into the behavioral health field allows us to continue to offer solutions to the states in which we have health plans as well as other states where behavioral health for medicaid recipients has been underserved corporate compliance   our corporate ethics and compliance programs were first established in 1998 and provide methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values are reflected in everything we do   the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing guidelines and the “compliance program guidance” series issued by the office of the inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services 10   our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are    our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations of our corporate compliance program competition   in the medicaid business our principal competitors for state contracts members and providers consist of the following types of organizations    we will continue to face varying levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations already in our service areas to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market the licensing requirements and bidding and contracting procedures in some states however present barriers to entry into the medicaid managed healthcare industry   we compete with other managed care organizations for state contracts in order to grant a contract state governments consider many factors these factors include quality of care financial requirements an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure   we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits in certain markets where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base   we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to 11 contract with us include existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities 

  specialized programs that focus on specific chronic diseases are often administered by companies that developed comprehensive care guidelines and patient support services appropriate to each specific disease or disorder high cost and high risk conditions offer the best return on investment in these programs and a number of companies compete for these contracts managed care organizations have long had disease specific initiatives but such programs are now offered by pharmacy benefit managers pharmaceutical makers and a number of specialty companies financial information   all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states our managed care subsidiaries in wisconsin texas indiana and new jersey have revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of consolidated revenues in 2003 our operations in ohio began on january 1 2004 other financial information about our segments is found in note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k regulation   our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically managed care organizations   our five health plan subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations in each of wisconsin texas indiana new jersey and ohio in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees   the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is lengthy and involved and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan’s organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs complaint procedures provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as deposit and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements in addition each health plan must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes including the development of new product offerings and in some states the expansion of service areas   the state of texas recently adopted a number of new regulations that may affect our business and results of operations under these regulations  12 medicaid   in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the state’s medicaid agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program   we have entered into a contract

commission to provide medicaid and schip managed care services in our texas markets through our superior healthplan inc subsidiary our texas medicaid contracts commenced september 1 2001 and have scheduled termination dates of august 31 2004 each medicaid contract is renewable for an additional oneyear period our schip contract began on october 1 2002 and is scheduled to end on august 31 2004

the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth in great detail the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector including provisions relating to    a health plan’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan a health plan must also submit many reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports hipaa   in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims one of the main requirements of hipaa is the implementation of standards for the processing of health insurance claims and for the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information   in august 2000 the department of health and human services or hhs issued new standards for submitting electronic claims and other administrative healthcare transactions the new standards were designed to streamline the processing of claims reduce the volume of paperwork and provide better service the administrative and financial healthcare transactions covered include    health plans other than certain smaller health plans were required to comply with the new standards by october 2002 but the deadline was extended to october 2003 for health plans that submitted a written compliance plan to cms by october 2002 the regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic media” since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media” many communications are considered electronically transmitted under the regulations health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format the regulation sets forth other rules that apply specifically to health plans as follows  14    on december 28 2000 hhs published final regulations setting forth new standards for protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information in any medium these regulations were modified by additional regulations published on august 14 2002 in which hhs addressed some of the implementation concerns on the part of the healthcare industry that had been raised by the initial final rule the regulations are designed to protect medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses compliance with the privacy regulations was required by april 2003 except for certain small health plans which have until april 2004 we have implemented processes policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations all employees received education and training regarding the new privacy requirements in addition the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have among numerous other requirements the new standards    the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements in addition the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not limited to the following    in february 2003 hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information these rules require healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored maintained or

patients’ rights legislation   the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients’ rights legislation in june and august 2001 respectively both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries although no version of this type of federal legislation has yet to become law patients’ rights proposals are currently pending in congress if enacted this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations we cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights legislation will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might take other fraud and abuse laws   investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and will require substantial resources employees   as of january 31 2004 we had approximately 950 employees our employees are not represented by a union we believe our relationships with our employees are good

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing the discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including those set forth below under “factors that may affect future results and the trading price of our common stock” overview   we are a multiline managed care organization that provides medicaid and medicaidrelated programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs including medicaid supplemental security income ssi and the state children’s health insurance program schip we have health plans in wisconsin texas indiana new jersey and ohio we also provide specialty services in texas california arizona colorado wisconsin and indiana these specialty services include behavioral health nurse triage and pharmacy compliance   we have organized this management’s discussion and analysis to address the following  recent acquisitions   effective january 1 2004 we commenced operations in ohio through the acquisition of the medicaidrelated assets of family health plan inc a subsidiary of mercy health partners for a purchase price of 68 million this transaction includes the right to serve up to 24000 of fhp’s medicaid members in toledo ohio a new market for us while we did incur startup cost in 2003 the results of operations of this entity will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january 1 2004   effective august 1 2003 we acquired the medicaidrelated contract rights of hmo blue texas in the san antonio texas market this transaction allows us to serve approximately 17000 additional members in the state our purchase price was 10 million we allocated the entire purchase price to acquired contracts the contracts are being amortized on a straightline basis over a period of five years the expected period of benefit   during 2003 we acquired a 100 ownership interest in group practice affiliates llc 637 in march 2003 and 363 in august 2003 gpa a behavioral healthcare services company serves over 700000 individuals in five states through a combination of networks groups and schools including a portion of our membership this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population we paid an aggregate purchase price of 18 million for gpa resulting in goodwill of 39 million   in march 2003 we purchased certain assets of scriptassist a medication compliance company we are administering the purchased contracts under the scriptassist name scriptassist uses various approaches and medical expertise to promote adherence to prescription drugs the asset acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population 19 the purchase price of 563000 was allocated to acquired contracts we are amortizing the contracts on a straightline basis over five years the expected period of benefit 

  on december 1 2002 we acquired 80 of the outstanding capital stock of university health plans inc from university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in october 2003 we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 20 uhp is a managed health plan operating in 20 counties in new jersey we paid an aggregate purchase price of 133 million for our interest in uhp the purchase price allocation resulted in intangible assets of 38 million representing provider contracts and purchased contract rights which are being amortized over 10 years and goodwill of 79 million   in june 2002 we entered into an agreement with texas universities health plan inc to purchase the schip contracts in three texas service areas thereby adding approximately 24000 members to our texas health plan the cash purchase price of 595000 was recorded as purchased contract rights which are being amortized on a straightline basis over five years the expected period of benefit   with our acquisition of gpa and our purchase of scriptassist assets we began operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services the medicaid managed care segment consists of our health plans including all of the functions needed to operate them the specialty services segment consists of our specialty services including our behavioral health nurse triage and pharmacy compliance functions critical accounting policies   our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 3 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein two of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty medical claims liabilities   our medical costs include claims paid claims adjudicated but not yet paid estimates for claims received but not yet adjudicated estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns cost trends product mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments if necessary are reflected in the period known   in applying this policy our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the determination of the required estimates while we believe these estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates for example a 1 increase or decrease in our health benefits ratio would have affected net earnings by 47 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 20   the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands    acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of uhp acquisitions in 2001 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of the remaining shares of superior healthplan   changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development in all of our markets including lower than anticipated utilization of medical services intangible assets   we have made several acquisitions since 2001 that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights provider contracts and goodwill purchased contract rights are amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from 60 to 120 months provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over 120 months   our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets impairment of an intangible asset is triggered when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible asset and related goodwill if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and estimates such as the discount factor in determining the estimated fair values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results   goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment analysis of intangible assets more frequently based on other factors these factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical contracts and provider networks and contracts we did not recognize any impairment losses during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 or 2001 revenue and expense discussion and key metrics   we are providing certain nongaap financial measures in this discussion of revenues and expenses which exclude the impact of a newly enacted premium tax which totaled 14 million in 2003 we believe that these figures are helpful in allowing the reader to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our 21 operations and measure our performance more consistently we use the presented nongaap financial measures internally to focus management on periodtoperiod changes in our business therefore we believe that this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the gaap presentation of financial information the presentation of this additional nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

revenues   we generate revenues in our medicaid managed care segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to provide health benefits to our members we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally receive premiums during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members   our specialty services companies generate revenues from a variety of sources our behavioral health company generates revenue via capitation payments from our health plans and others it also receives fees for the direct provision of care and certain school programs in arizona our pharmacy compliance program receives fee income from the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals nursewise receives fees from health plans physicians and other organizations for providing continuous access to nurse advisors   premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue premiums due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive premiums during the month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total premium revenue and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial position or results of operations   the primary drivers of our increasing revenue have been membership growth in our medicaid managed care segment and our entry into the specialty services segment we have increased our membership through internal growth and acquisitions from december 31 2001 to december 31 2003 we increased our membership by 108 the following table sets forth our membership by state    the following table sets forth our membership by line of business    in 2003 our membership increased by 17000 members in texas due to the purchase of contract rights from hmo blue texas our membership increased in all our markets from additions to our provider network increases in counties served and growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries 22   in 2002 our membership increased by 24000 members in texas due to the purchase of schip contract rights from texas universities health plan in addition two smaller plans exited the austin texas market as a result our texas plan increased its membership by 28000 lives this increase includes 12000 lives that we are managing for the state of texas on an interim basis and that will become part of a reprocurement process scheduled for mid2004 we entered the new jersey market through our acquisition of uhp membership increases in our wisconsin and indiana markets resulted from additions to our provider network and growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries operating expenses   our operating expenses include medical costs cost of services and general and administrative expenses   our medical costs include payments to physicians hospitals and other providers for healthcare and specialty product claims medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported or ibnr monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates   our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred our health benefits ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided the table below depicts our health benefits ratios by member category and in total    our medicaid and schip ratio decreased in 2003 from 2002 due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate emergency department usage and to establish preferred drug lists such as generics the addition of the ssi members in new jersey in december 2002 has caused our total health benefits ratio to increase slightly the health benefits ratio for ssi is affected by a low membership base and is subject to greater volatility as a percentage of premiums although relatively immaterial in total dollars to total medical costs we expect the health benefits ratio for ssi to decrease as these members become fully integrated into our medical management programs as our membership base grows within the state of new jersey and as our membership base grows in other markets   our cost of services expenses include all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues these expenses primarily consist of the salaries and wages of the physicians clinicians therapists and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to the clinics and supporting facilities and equipment used to provide services   our general and administrative expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to health plans specialty companies and our centralized functions that support all of our business units the major centralized functions are claims processing information systems and finance in september 2003 concurrent with a rate increase received in one state we began to be charged premium taxes by that state premium taxes are classified as general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expense ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to drive those 23 revenues the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratios by business segment and in total 

    the improvement in the medicaid managed care general and administrative expenses ratio reflects growth in membership and leveraging of our overall infrastructure this ratio decreased in 2003 from 2002 despite 1 the levying of the premium tax from one of our states which resulted in 14 million additional general and administrative expense 2 increased spending on tax planning initiatives and 3 startup costs primarily in the fourth quarter related to our new health plan in ohio the specialty services ratio may vary depending on the various contracts and nature of the service provided and will have a higher general and administrative expense ratio than the medicaid managed care segment other income expense   other income expense consists principally of investment and other income and interest expense  24 results of operations year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002   summarized comparative financial data for 2003 and 2002 are as follows  in millions  

 

   premiums for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 648 from the comparable period in 2002 this increase was due to organic growth in our existing markets changes in our member mix by product category the purchase of the texas contracts and the addition of our new jersey membership through our acquisition of uhp in addition we received premium rate increases ranging from 10 to 75 or 46 on a composite basis across our markets   services revenues increased due to an increase in our nonrisk ssi membership in our texas market and the addition of services revenues of gpa beginning march 1 2003 

 

   medical costs increased 650 due to the growth in our membership as discussed above our medicaid and schip health benefits ratio decreased to 817 from 822 due in part to our initiatives to reduce emergency department usage and to establish preferred drug lists as previously discussed   cost of services increased due to the inclusion of direct costs related to the services revenues of gpa beginning march 1 2003   general and administrative expenses increased 763 primarily due to expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth and expansion into the specialty services segment additionally general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the institution of a premium tax tax planning costs incurred during the year and ohio startup costs previously discussed 

 

   other income expense in 2002 included a onetime dividend of 51 million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment excluding this onetime gain other income increased from 2002 with higher investment balances in 2003 partially offset by a lower interest rate environment and interest expense on our corporate headquarters’ mortgage 25 

 

   our effective tax rate in 2003 was 376 compared to 380 in 2002 the decrease was primarily due to increased levels of taxexempt interest income and a lower effective state tax rate 

 

   our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2003 primarily resulting from the followon offering of 3450000 shares sold in august 2003 year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001   summarized comparative financial data for 2002 and 2001 are as follows  in millions  

 

   premiums for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 413 due to organic growth in our existing markets the purchase of the texas schip contracts and the inclusion of one month of revenues of uhp in addition we received premium rate increases ranging from 15 to 107 or 51 on a composite basis across our markets   services revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 increased due to increases in our nonrisk ssi membership in our texas market 

 

   medical costs for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 405 reflecting the growth in our membership   cost of services increased 12000 from the comparable period in 2001 while the nonrisk ssi membership increased between periods the cost of services remained flat as we leveraged existing systems to support the increased membership   general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 331 reflecting a higher level of wages and related expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth 

 

   other income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 60 million from 2001 a majority of the increase was due to the receipt of a onetime dividend of 51 million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment in addition investment income increased due to a larger 26 amount of dollars invested and interest expense decreased year over year due to the repayment of our subordinated debt in december 2001 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 380 this compares to an effective tax rate of 415 for the year ended december 31 2001 our effective tax rate decreased year over year due to increased levels of taxexempt interest income and a lower effective state tax rate 

 

   our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2002 resulting from the followon offering of 705743 shares sold in june 2002 and 4875000 shares sold in our initial public offering in december 2001 liquidity and capital resources   in august 2003 we closed our followon public offering of 3450000 shares of common stock at 2500 per share we received net proceeds totaling 813 million from this offering we intend to use our net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions of businesses assets and technologies that are complementary to our business we may use proceeds to acquire medicaid and schip businesses specialty services businesses and contract rights in order to increase our membership and to expand our business into new service areas   in june 2002 we closed our followon public offering whereby 7919258 shares were sold by selling stockholders and 705743 shares were sold by us at 1650 per share we received net proceeds of 103 million from this offering   in december 2001 we closed our initial public offering of 4875000 shares of common stock at 933 per share we received net proceeds of 410 million prior to this offering we financed our operations and growth through private equity and debt financings and internally generated funds   our operating activities provided cash of 560 million in 2003 397 million in 2002 and 302 million in 2001 the increases in 2003 and 2002 were due to continued profitability increases in membership increases in medical claims liabilities and the timing of premium receipts   our investing activities used cash of 1407 million in 2003 and 797 million in 2002 and provided cash of 27 million in 2001 the largest component of investing activities related to increases in our investment portfolio our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases sales and maturities as of december 31 2003 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixedincome securities with an average duration of 36 years cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash the average annualized portfolio yield was 37 for the year ended december 31 2003 and 69 for 2002 exclusive of a onetime dividend of 51 million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment our yield decreased due to our investment in taxadvantaged securities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002 as well as a decrease in the overall interest rate environment   our financing activities provided cash of 894 million in 2003 108 million in 2002 and 370 million in 2001 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our public offering completed in august 2003 during 2002 financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our offering completed in june 2002 during 2001 financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our initial public offering net of the repayment of subordinated notes with 40 million of our proceeds 27   we spent 66 million and 39 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively on capital assets consisting primarily of new software software and hardware upgrades and furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions in 2001 we purchased 36 million of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements due to the addition of the austin and san antonio markets and the expansion of the wisconsin market we anticipate spending 105 million on additional capital expenditures in 2004 related to office and market expansions and system upgrades   in july 2003 we purchased the building in which our corporate headquarters in st louis missouri is located for an aggregate purchase price of 126 million we financed a portion of the purchase price through an 80 million nonrecourse mortgage loan arrangement the mortgage bears interest at the prevailing prime rate less 25 at december 31 2003 our mortgage bore interest at 375   at december 31 2003 we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities of 185 million as compared to 88 million at december 31 2002 our working capital is negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm our investment policies are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital we manage our shortterm and longterm investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund working capital as needed   cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 795 million at december 31 2003 and 692 million at december 31 2002 longterm investments were 2052 million at december 31 2003 and 954 million at december 31 2002 including restricted deposits of 204 million and 158 million respectively cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 1267 million and 520 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively based on our operating plan we expect that our available cash cash equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing contractual commitments   our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2003 consisted of obligations under operating leases and mortgage obligations for our corporate headquarters the noncancelable lease and mortgage payments over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands    we have a 25 million revolving line of credit facility with lasalle bank na lasalle which expires in may 2004 the facility has interest rates based on lasalle’s prime rate or libor the line is secured by the common stock of our subsidiaries the facility includes financial covenants including requirements of minimum ebitda and minimum tangible net worth we are required to obtain lasalle’s consent to any proposed acquisition that would result in a violation of any of the covenants contained in the facility as of december 31 2003 we were in compliance with all covenants and no funds were outstanding on the facility regulatory capital and dividend restrictions   our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as managed care organizations these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us generally the amount of 28 dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

  our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate as of december 31 2003 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 647 million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of 309 million   the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage as of december 31 2003 our wisconsin texas and ohio health plans were in compliance with riskbased capital requirements indiana has adopted riskbased capital rules that will take effect as of december 31 2004 if adopted by new jersey riskbased capital may increase the minimum capital required for our health plan in new jersey we continue to monitor the requirements in indiana and new jersey and do not expect that they will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows recent accounting pronouncements   a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on our financial position and results of operations can be found in note 3 to our annual consolidated financial statements under the caption recent accounting pronouncements included elsewhere herein forwardlooking statements   this filing contains forwardlooking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including “believe” “anticipate” “plan” “expect” “estimate” “intend” “seek” “goal” “may” “will” “should” “can” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements include statements about our market opportunity our growth strategy competition expected activities and future acquisitions investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources these statements may be found in the sections of this filing entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “business” readers are cautioned that matters subject to forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including economic regulatory competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions   actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses a variety of factors including competition changes in health care practices changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations inflation provider contract changes new technologies governmentimposed surcharges taxes or assessments reduction in provider payments by governmental payers major epidemics disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare such as major healthcare providers’ inability to maintain their operations may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses once set premiums are generally fixed for oneyear periods and accordingly unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums the expiration cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively impact us due to these factors and risks we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 29 factors that may affect future results and the trading price of our common stock 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company risks related to being a regulated entity 

 

   most of our revenues come from medicaid and schip premiums the base premium rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a member’s health status age gender county or region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid and schip premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints changes to medicaid and schip programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid and schip we believe that reductions in medicaid and schip payments could substantially reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 

 

   we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs including medicaid ssi and schip we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate the contracts expire on various dates between april 30 2004 and december 31 2004 our contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory agencies in addition the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts are generally intended to run for two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so when our contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended if any of our contracts are terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially affected 

 

   our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan providers and members rather than stockholders changes in existing laws and rules the enactment of new laws and rules or changing interpretations of these laws and rules could among other things  30    for example congress has considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients’ bill of rights and patient protection legislation is currently pending in congress we cannot predict the impact of this legislation if adopted on our business 

 

   our texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels similarly our new jersey plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event its health benefits ratio is less than 80 these regulatory requirements changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues the states of texas indiana and new jersey have implemented promptpayment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results   also on january 18 2002 cms published a final rule that removed a provision contained in the federal medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting states to reimburse nonstate governmentowned or operated hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to 150 of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services furnished by these hospitals under medicaid payment principles the upper payment limit was reduced to 100 of medicare payments for comparable services this development in federal regulation decreased the profitability of our health plans 

 

   federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid ssi and schip programs if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers it would negatively impact our ability to operate our business for example failure to pay our providers promptly could result in the imposition of fines and other penalties in some states we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations   the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse further hipaa imposes civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 

 

   on august 17 2000 the united states department of health and human services or hhs issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for 31 healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically we were originally required to comply with this regulation by october 16 2003 on july 24 2003 cms issued guidance allowing covered entities to implement contingency plans and accept legacy transaction formats if they were not able to meet the october 16th 2003 compliance date the objective of the guidance was to “ensure the smooth flow of payments” within the health care industry many of the states that we operate in implemented contingency plans which resulted in staggered compliance dates for the organization from october 16 2003 to april 16 2004 

  in december 2000 hhs issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections under hipaa that became effective on april 14 2001 and for which compliance was required by april 14 2003 we have begun to integrate gpa into our privacy program gpa’s privacy policies and procedures are being updated to align with our policies and procedures and all gpa employees are receiving job specific education and training on our privacy practices full integration of our privacy program at gpa is expected by the second quarter of 2004   on february 20 2003 hhs published the final hipaa health data security regulations the security regulations became effective on april 21 2003 compliance with the security regulations is required by april 21 2005 these regulations will require covered entities to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect electronic health information maintained or transmitted by the organization   the issuance of future judicial or regulatory guidance regarding the interpretation of regulations the states’ ability to promulgate stricter rules and continuing uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations’ implementation may make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult for example our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with the new security regulations in order to comply with the regulatory requirements we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems the costs of which were 310000 in 2003 and are not expected to exceed 500000 in 2004 further compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations the new regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

   numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business for example these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for medicaid and reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services more generally we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

 

   in february 2003 the bush administration proposed a major longterm change in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow states to elect to receive combined medicaidschip “allotments” for acute and longterm health care for lowincome uninsured persons participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted or if so how it may change from the initial proposal accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons 32 enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided our growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

   schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

 

   we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request to pay dividends to us the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy risks related to our business 

 

   nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member these premiums are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our customers if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings will be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues to increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate our profitability would be harmed 

 

   our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses historically our health benefits ratio has fluctuated for example our health benefits ratio was 824 for the year ended december 31 2003 823 for 2002 828 for 2001 and 843 for 2000 but was 889 for 1999 and 884 for 1998 because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

 

   our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr medical expenses we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if necessary are made to medical expenses 33 in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations from time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions further harming our results 

 

   historically the acquisition of medicaid businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth for example our acquisition of 80 of the equity of uhp on december 1 2002 accounted for 303 of the increase in our membership for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2001 many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are interested either in a selling along with their medicaid assets other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies including their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses   we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities furthermore our credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the consent of our bank lender   in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations this may include the integration of    accordingly we may be unable to identify consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 

 

   we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement in 2003 for example we acquired gpa a behavioral health services company and purchased contract and name rights of scriptassist a medication compliance company in order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of gpa scriptassist and any other specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from 34 us in any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 

 

   startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover startup costs the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 

 

   operations in wisconsin texas indiana new jersey and ohio account for a majority of our premium revenues if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues would decrease materially our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative actions economic conditions and similar factors in those states our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 

 

   we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share   some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected   in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 

 

   our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians 35 specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days’ prior written notice we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 

  from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully in addition we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures and we may be subject to similar claims regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively   we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms   if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed 

 

   we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business if we lose one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships our business and operating results could be harmed we do not have an employment agreement with mr neidorff and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain his services our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel 

 

   recently the managed care industry has received negative publicity this publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 

 

   our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims in addition some states including texas have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations claims of this nature if successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit they would still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our management’s attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 36 

 

   our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims in recent years the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future as a result of the level of these costs providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas which may not address the needs of medicaid participants we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner if at all and our business could be adversely affected 

 

   less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events including acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases our results of operations will suffer 

 

   historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 

 

   we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid enrollment in managed care is mandatory currently approximately twothirds of the states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in all or a portion of their counties the programs are voluntary in other states because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment we expect the geographic expansion of our medicaid managed care segment to be limited to those states 

 

   our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information   our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs moreover our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in addition our ability to integrate and manage our 37 information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists 

 

   we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services these claims could be substantial we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 

 

 investments   as of december 31 2003 we had shortterm investments of 152 million and longterm investments of 2052 million including restricted deposits of 204 million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of municipal bonds and us treasury investments and have original maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states’ requirements these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase we have the ability to hold these shortterm investments to maturity which would mitigate the risk of a significant increase in market rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at december 31 2003 the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 58 million declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income inflation   although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services   while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases compliance costs   federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued recently due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted implementation of additional systems and programs will be required the cost of which we estimate not to exceed 500000 in 2004 further compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states 38

item 1  business

                                    overview

     we provide managed care programs and related services to individuals
receiving benefits under medicaid including supplemental security income or
ssi and the state childrens health insurance program or schip we have health
plans in wisconsin texas indiana and new jersey we believe our local approach
to managing our health plans including provider and member services enables us
to provide accessible high quality culturallysensitive healthcare services to
our members our disease management educational and other initiatives are
designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they
receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of
routine health problems as well as more severe acute and chronic conditions we
combine our decentralized local approach with centralized finance information
systems claims processing and medical management support functions

     we were organized in wisconsin in 1993 as coordinated care corporation we
initially were formed to serve as a holding company for a medicaid managed care
line of business that has been operating in wisconsin since 1984 we changed our
corporate name to centene corporation in 1997 and reincorporated in delaware in
november 2001

     we maintain a website with the address wwwcentenecom we are not
including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating
it by reference into this report we make available free of charge through our
website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and
current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or
furnish such material to the sec

                                  our approach

     our approach to managed care is based on the following key attributes

      medicaid expertise  over the last 19 years we have developed a
       specialized medicaid expertise that has helped us establish and maintain
       strong relationships with our constituent communities of members
       providers and state governments we have implemented programs developed
       to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for
       members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use inpatient days and
       high cost interventions as well as by managing care of chronic
       illnesses we do this primarily by providing nurse case managers who
       support our physicians in implementing disease management programs and by
       providing incentives for our physicians to provide preventive care on a
       regular basis we recruit and train staff and providers who are attentive
       to the needs of our members and who are experienced in working with
       culturally diverse lowincome medicaid populations our experience in
       working with state regulators helps us to implement and deliver our
       programs and services efficiently and affords us opportunities to provide
       input on medicaid industry practices and policies in the states in which
       we operate

      localized services support and branding  we provide access to
       healthcare services through local networks of providers and staff that
       focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities our systems
       and procedures have been designed to address these communityspecific
       challenges through outreach education transportation and other member
       support activities for example our community outreach program employs
       several former medicaid recipients to work with our members and their
       communities to promote health and to promote selfimprovement through
       employment and education we use locally recognized plan names and we
       tailor our materials and processes to meet the needs of the communities
       and the state programs we serve our approach to communitybased service
       results in local accountability and solidifies our decentralized
       management and operational structure

                                        3

      state budget deficits  our approach in these difficult economic times
       for states is to work with state agencies on redefining benefit levels
       eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules in order to maximize
       the number of uninsured individuals covered through medicaid and schip
       while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation

      physiciandriven approach  we have implemented a physiciandriven
       approach in which our physicians are actively engaged in developing and
       implementing our healthcare delivery policies and strategies our local
       boards of directors which help shape the character and quality of our
       organization have significant provider representation in each of our
       principal geographic markets this approach is designed to eliminate
       unnecessary costs improve service to our members and simplify the
       administrative burdens on our providers it has enabled us to strengthen
       our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and
       retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base

      efficiency of business model  we have designed our business model to
       allow us to readily add new members in our existing markets and expand
       into new regions in which we may choose to operate the combination of
       our decentralized local approach to operating our health plans and our
       centralized finance information systems claims processing and medical
       management support functions allows us to quickly and economically
       integrate new business opportunities because of our business model we
       believe we would be able to quickly recover from a disaster in one of our
       plan locations by moving member and physician services to one of our
       other locations

      specialized systems and technology  through our specialized information
       systems we are able to strengthen our relationships with providers and
       states which help us to grow our membership base these systems also
       help us identify needs for new healthcare programs physicians can use
       our claims utilization and membership data to manage their practices
       more efficiently and they benefit from our timely and accurate payments
       state agencies can use data from our information systems to demonstrate
       that their medicaid populations are receiving quality healthcare in an
       efficient manner

      complementary business lines  we have begun to broaden our service
       offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally
       underserved by medicaid managed care organizations we believe other
       business lines such as our nursewise triage program will allow us to
       expand our services and diversify our sources of revenue

                                  our strategy

     our objective is to become the leading national medicaid managed care
organization we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following
key components of our strategy

      increase penetration of existing state markets  we intend to continue to
       increase our membership in states in which we currently operate through
       alliances with key providers outreach efforts development and
       implementation of communityspecific products and acquisitions for
       example in indiana where the state assigns members to physicians we
       increased our membership in 2002 by recruiting additional physicians we
       may also increase membership by acquiring medicaid businesses contracts
       and other related assets from our competitors in our existing markets
       such as our purchase of texas universities health plans schip contracts
       in 2002

      develop and acquire additional state markets  we continue to leverage
       our experience in identifying and developing new markets by seeking both
       to acquire existing businesses and to build our own operations we expect
       to focus our expansion on states where medicaid recipients are mandated
       to enroll in managed care organizations for example we entered the new
       jersey market by acquiring 80 of the equity of university health plans
       inc or uhp on december 1 2002

      address emerging state needs  we are working to assist the states in
       which we operate in addressing the financial and other challenges they
       face in these difficult economic times we seek to assist the states in
       balancing premium rates benefit levels member eligibility policies and
       practices and provider compensation by helping states structure an
       appropriate level and range of medicaid and
                                        4
page

       schip services we seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide
       those services on terms that protect our targeted gross margins and
       provide an acceptable return to our stockholders

      diversify our business lines  we seek to broaden our business lines into
       areas that complement our business to enable us to grow our revenue
       stream and decrease our dependence on medicaid reimbursement in addition
       to nursewise we are considering services such as behavioral health
       disease management and other medicaid related feeforservice lines of
       business that would complement our core business we believe we may have
       opportunities to offer these services to other managed care organizations
       and states

      leverage our information technologies to enhance operating
       efficiencies  we intend to continue to invest in our centralized
       information systems to further streamline our processes and drive
       efficiencies in our operations and to add functionality to improve the
       service we provide to our members our information systems enable us to
       add members and markets quickly and economically for example we began
       paying claims for uhp out of our centralized claims facility within the
       first week after we acquired an 80 equity interest in the new jersey
       health plan

                               medicaid and schip

     medicaid is a health insurance program for lowincome families and
individuals with disabilities each state establishes its own eligibility
standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within
federal standards as a result there are 56 medicaid programs  one for each
state each territory and the district of columbia medicaid eligibility is
based on a combination of income and asset requirements subject to federal
guidelines financial requirements are most often determined by an income level
relative to the federal poverty level historically children have represented
the largest eligibility group for medicaid

     ssi covers lowincome aged blind and disabled persons ssi beneficiaries
represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients and ssi recipients
typically utilize more services because of their more critical health issues

     schip was established to provide coverage for lowincome children not
otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs all states have
adopted schip

     since the early 1980s increasing healthcare costs combined with
significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients have led many states to
establish medicaid managed care initiatives state premium payments to managed
care plans are financed in part by the federal government in recent years a
growing number of states including each of the states in which we operate have
mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans

                          member programs and services

     we recognize the importance of memberfocused services in the delivery of
quality managed care services our locally based staff assists members in
accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services
and addressing member concerns and questions while covered healthcare benefits
vary from state to state our health plans generally provide the following
services

      primary and specialty physician care

      inpatient and outpatient hospital care

      emergency and urgent care

      prenatal care

      laboratory and xray services

      home health and durable medical equipment

      behavioral health and substance abuse services

                                   providers

     for each of our service areas we establish a provider network consisting
of primary and specialty care physicians hospitals and ancillary providers as
of january 31 2003 our health plans had the following numbers of physicians
and hospitals

     the primary care physician is a critical component in care delivery and
also in the management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members
primary care physicians include family and general practitioners pediatricians
internal medicine physicians and obgyns specialty care physicians provide
medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians

     we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing
financial and utilization information physician and patient educational
programs and disease and medical management programs as well as adhering to a
prompt payment policy our programs are also designed to help the physicians
coordinate care outside of their offices

     we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a
competitive advantage in entering new markets our physicians serve on local
committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs managing
costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members while
assuming responsibility for medical policy decision making the following are
among the services we provide to support physicians

      customized utilization reports provide our contracted physicians with
       information that enables them to run their practices more efficiently and
       focuses them on specific patient needs for example quarterly fund
       detail reports update physicians on their status within their risk pools
       equivalency reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of
       capitated versus feeforservice arrangements

      case management support helps the physician coordinate specialty care and
       ancillary services for patients with complex conditions and direct
       members to appropriate community resources to address both their health
       and socioeconomic needs

      webbased claims and eligibility resources have been implemented in
       selected markets to provide physicians with online access to perform
       claims and eligibility inquiries

     our physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our
members including the connections epsdt case management and disease management
programs for example the connections staff facilitate doctorpatient
relationships by connecting members with physicians the epsdt programs
encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease
management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic
disease

     we provide access to healthcare services for our members primarily through
nonexclusive contracts with our providers our contracts with primary and
specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to twoyear periods
and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject
to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice in the
absence of a contract we typically pay providers at state medicaid
reimbursement levels we pay physicians under a capitated or feeforservice
arrangement

      under our capitated contract primary care physicians are paid a monthly
       capitation rate for each of our members assigned to his or her practice
       and are at risk for all costs related to primary and specialty physician
       and emergency room services in return for this payment these physicians
       provide all primary care and preventive services including primary care
       office visits and epsdt services if these physicians also provide
       noncapitated services to their assigned members they may bill and be
       paid under feeforservice arrangements at medicaid rates

      under our feeforservice contracts with physicians particularly
       specialty care physicians we pay the physicians a negotiated fee for
       covered services this model is characterized as having no financial risk
       for the physician

     we also contract with ancillary providers on a negotiated fee arrangement
for physical therapy mental health and chemical dependency care home
healthcare vision care diagnostic laboratory tests xray examinations
ambulance services and durable medical equipment additionally we contract with
dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit in
wisconsin and indiana where prescription and limited overthecounter drugs are
a covered benefit we have a capitated arrangement with a national pharmacy
vendor that provides a pharmacy network

     our ability to establish and maintain our position as a leader in the

      cost saving outreach and disease management programs and

      responsible collection and dissemination of encounter data

                               quality management

     our medical management program focuses on improving quality of care in
areas that have the greatest impact on our members we employ strategies
including disease management and complex case management that are finetuned for
implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees
chaired by local physician leaders this process promotes physician
participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical
quality improvement program

     we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical
quality management activities information is drawn from our data warehouse the
clinical databases and amisys as sources to identify opportunities to improve
care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those
improvements some examples of these intervention programs include

      a prenatal case management program to help women with highrisk
       pregnancies deliver fullterm healthy infants

      a program to reduce the number of inappropriate emergency room visits
       and

      a disease management program to decrease the need for emergency room
       visits and hospitalizations for asthma patients

                                        8

     additionally we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data

quality performance efforts this reporting is monitored by plan quality
improvement committees and our corporate medical management team

     in order to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the
credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported
by the national committee for quality assurance

                         management information systems

     the ability to access data and translate them into meaningful information
is essential to operating across a multistate service area in a costeffective
manner our centralized information systems located in saint louis missouri
support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and
are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate internal growth
and growth from acquisitions we have the ability to leverage the platform we
have developed for one state for configuration into new states or health plan
acquisitions this integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources
of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans the
system is currently configured and is supporting claims automatic adjudication
rates of approximately 84 in all markets our amisys production system is
capable of supporting over one million members

     we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and
implemented in conjunction with a third party this plan allows us complete
access to the business resumption centers and hotsite facilities provided by
it we have contracted with the third party to provide us with annual plan
updates through 2005

                              corporate compliance

     our corporate ethics and compliance programs were first established in 1998
and provide methods by which we further enhance operations safeguard against
fraud and abuse improve access to quality care and help assure that our values
are reflected in everything we do

     the two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the
health care industry are measured are the 1991 federal organizational sentencing
guidelines and the compliance program guidance issued by the office of the
inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services

     our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the sentencing
guidelines and the oig guidance these key components are

      written standards of conduct

      designation of a corporate compliance officer and compliance committee

      effective training and education

      effective lines for reporting and communication

      enforcement of standards through disciplinary guidelines and actions

      internal monitoring and auditing and

      prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action
       plans

     our internal corporate compliance website accessible by all employees
contains our business ethics and conduct policy our mission values and
philosophies and compliance programs a companywide policy and procedure
database and our tollfree hotline to allow employees or other persons to report
anonymously suspected incidents of fraud abuse or other violations of our
corporate compliance program

                                  competition

     in the medicaid business our principal competitors for state contracts
members and providers consist of the following types of organizations

      primary care case management programs are programs established by the
       states through contracts with primary care providers under these
       programs physicians provide primary care services to medicaid
       recipients as well as limited medical management oversight

      national and regional commercial managed care organizations have medicaid
       and medicare members in addition to members in private commercial plans

      medicaid managed care organizations focus solely on providing healthcare
       services to medicaid recipients the vast majority of which operate in
       one city or state providers especially hospitals own many of these
       plans their membership is small relative to the infrastructure that is
       required for them to do business there are a few multistate
       medicaidonly organizations that tend to be larger in size and therefore
       are able to leverage their infrastructure over larger memberships

     we will continue to face varying levels of competition as we expand in our
existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require at
least two competitors in each service area healthcare reform proposals may
cause a number of commercial managed care organizations already in our service
areas to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market however the licensing
requirements and bidding and contracting procedures in some states present
barriers to entry into the medicaid managed healthcare industry

     we compete with other managed care organizations for state contracts in
order to win a bid for or be awarded a state contract state governments
consider many factors which include providing quality care satisfying
financial requirements demonstrating an ability to deliver services and
establishing provider networks and infrastructure some of the factors may be
outside our control

     we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members people
who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans
typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and service offered ease
of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the
availability of supplemental benefits

     we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into
contracts with physicians physician groups and other providers we believe the
factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include
existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management
programs timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities

                                   regulation

     our healthcare operations are regulated at both state and federal levels
government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a
changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory
agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and
enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur
periodically

managed care organizations

     our four health plan subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health
maintenance organizations in each of wisconsin texas indiana and new jersey
in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the
relevant health insurance andor human services departments that oversee the
activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide
services to medicaid enrollees

     the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care
organization is lengthy and involved and requires demonstration to the
regulators of the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure
financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs and
complaint procedures under both state managed care organization statutes and
state insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum
statutory capital requirements and other financial requirements such as minimum
capital deposit
                                        10

and reserve requirements insurance regulations may also require the prior state
approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations businesses and the
payment of dividends as well as notice requirements for loans or the transfer
of funds our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements
in addition each health plan must meet numerous criteria to secure the approval
of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes
including the development of new product offerings and in some states the
expansion of service areas

medicaid

     in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states
in which we operate we must operate under a contract with the states medicaid
agency states generally use either a formal proposal process reviewing a
number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that
apply for entry to the program

     we have entered into a contract with the wisconsin department of health and
family services to provide medicaid services the contract commenced january 1
2002 and has a scheduled termination of december 31 2003 we expect to renew
this contract for an additional twoyear term prior to its expiration the

to end on august 31 2003 the contracts generally may be terminated upon any
event of default or in the event state or federal funding for medicaid programs
is no longer available we receive monthly payments under each of our texas
contracts based on specified capitation rates calculated on an actuarial basis

     we have entered into a contract with the state of indiana to provide
indiana medicaid and indiana childrens health insurance program services the
contract commenced january 1 2003 and has a scheduled termination of december
31 2004 this contract may be terminated by the state without cause upon sixty
days prior written notice we are paid based on specified capitation rates for
our services

june 30 2003 the agreement is renewable annually for successive twelvemonth
periods the contract may be terminated by the state for event of default or
significant change in circumstances we receive monthly payments based on

     our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us
generally set forth in great detail the requirements for operating in the
medicaid sector including provisions relating to

      eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes

      covered services

medicaid services or cms a health plan is also subject to periodic
comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third party reviewing

hipaa

     in 1996 congress enacted the health insurance portability and
accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the act is designed to improve the
portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the
administration of health insurance claims one of the main requirements of hipaa
is the implementation of standards for the processing of health insurance claims
and for the security and privacy of individually identifiable health
information

     in august 2000 the department of health and human services or hhs issued
new standards for submitting electronic claims and other administrative
healthcare transactions the new standards were designed to streamline the
processing of claims reduce the volume of paperwork and provide better service
the administrative and financial healthcare transactions covered include

      health claims and equivalent encounter information

      enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan

      eligibility for a health plan

      healthcare payment and remittance advice

      health plan premium payments

      coordination of benefits

      healthcare claim status and

      referral certification and authorization

     health plans other than certain smaller health plans were required to
comply with the new standards by october 2002 but the deadline was extended to
october 2003 for health plans that submitted a written compliance plan to cms by
october 2002 the regulations requirements apply to transactions conducted

using electronic media because electronic media is defined broadly to
include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another
using magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications will be
considered electronically transmitted in addition health plans will be
required to have the capacity to accept and send all standard transactions in a
standardized electronic format the regulation sets forth other rules that apply
specifically to health plans as follows

      a plan may not delay processing of a standard transaction that is it
       must complete transactions using the new standards at least as quickly as
       it had prior to implementation of the new standards

      there should be no degradation in the transmission of receipt of
       processing of and response to a standard transaction as compared to the
       handling of a nonstandard transaction

      if a plan uses a healthcare clearinghouse to process a standard request
       the other party to the transaction may not be charged more or otherwise
       disadvantaged as a result of using the clearinghouse

      a plan may not reject a standard transaction on the grounds that it
       contains data that is not needed or used by the plan

      a plan may not adversely affect or attempt to adversely affect the
       other party to a transaction for requesting a standard transaction and

      if a plan coordinates benefits with another plan then upon receiving a
       standard transaction it must store the coordination of benefits data
       required to forward the transaction to the other plan

in addition on august 14 2002 hss published modifications to the final
privacy regulations which addressed the implementation concerns of the
healthcare industry

     on december 28 2000 hhs published a final regulation setting forth new
standards for protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health
information in any medium compliance with these rules will be required by april
2003 except for certain small health plans which will have until april 2004
the new regulation is designed to protect medical records and other personal
health information maintained and used by healthcare providers hospitals
health plans and health insurers and healthcare clearinghouses among numerous
other requirements the new standards

      limit certain nonconsensual uses and disclosures of private health
       information and require patient authorizations for such uses and
       disclosures of private health information

      give patients new rights to access their medical records and to know who
       else has accessed them

      limit most disclosure of health information to the minimum needed for the
       intended purpose

      establish procedures to ensure the protection of private health
       information

      establish new requirements for access to records by researchers and
       others and

      establish new criminal and civil sanctions for improper use or disclosure
       of health information

     the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will
not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal
requirements the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to
prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met including but not
limited to the following

      the state law is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse related to the
       provision of and payment for healthcare

      the state law is necessary to ensure appropriate state regulation of
       insurance and health plans

      the state law is necessary for state reporting on healthcare delivery or
       costs or

      the state law addresses controlled substances

     in addition on august 12 1998 hhs published proposed regulations
relating to the security of individually identifiable health information these
rules would require healthcare providers health plans and

                                        13

healthcare clearinghouses to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such
information when it is electronically stored maintained or transmitted through
such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits the
final security regulations were released on february 20 2003 the compliance
deadline for the security regulations is april 20 2005 the security
regulations require health plans health care clearinghouses and certain
providers to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to
protect electronic protected health information

patients rights legislation

     the united states senate and house of representatives passed different
versions of patients rights legislation in june and august 2001 respectively
both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to
participants in federal healthcare programs including medicaid beneficiaries
this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and
increase our regulatory compliance costs depending on the final form of any
patients rights legislation such legislation could among other things expose
us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that
deny benefits or delay beneficiaries receipt of benefits as a result of our
medical necessity or other coverage determinations the differences include such
matters as the amount of allowable damages whether cases would be governed by
federal or state law and whether such actions could be brought in federal or
state courts we cannot predict when or whether patients rights legislation
will be enacted into law or if enacted what final form such legislation might
take

other fraud and abuse laws

     investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top
priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade the focus of these
efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare
programs such as medicaid the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud
and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to plans participating in
these programs are complex and changing and will require substantial resources

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

overview

     we provide managed care programs and related services to individuals
receiving benefits under medicaid including supplemental security income or
ssi and the state childrens health insurance program or schip we have health
plans in wisconsin texas indiana and new jersey

     on december 1 2002 we acquired 80 of the outstanding capital stock of
university health plans or uhp from university of medicine and dentistry of
new jersey or umdnj which continues to own the remaining capital stock of uhp
uhp is a managed health plan operating in 15 counties in new jersey we paid an
aggregate purchase price of approximately 106 million for our interest in uhp
we entered into an investor rights agreement with umdnj providing that among
other things

      we have the right exercisable at any time prior to september 1 2003
       to purchase the remaining shares of uhp held by umdnj for a cash purchase
       price of 26 million

      if we do not exercise the right described above the remaining shares of
       uhp held by umdnj will be exchanged on december 1 2005 for a purchase
       price payable in either at our election shares of our common stock or
       cash the purchase price would equal the greater of a 26 million or
       b the product of 1 the enterprise value of uhp as of december 1 2005
       and 2 the percentage of the outstanding uhp common stock on a fully
       diluted basis then represented by the shares owned by umdnj

     in june 2002 superior healthplan entered into an agreement with texas
universities health plan inc to purchase the schip contracts in three texas
service areas effective september 1 october 1 and november 1 2002 the state
of texas approved the contract sales between superior and texas universities
health plan thereby adding approximately 24000 members to our texas health
plan as a result of this transaction 595 was recorded as an intangible asset
purchased contract rights we are amortizing the contract rights on a
straightline basis over five years the period expected to be benefited

revenues

     we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in
which we operate to provide health benefits to our members we receive a fixed
premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts we generally
receive premiums during the month we provide services and recognize premium
revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our
members we also generate administrative services fees for providing services to
ssi members on a nonrisk basis

     premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned premiums premiums
due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net
of an allowance based on historical trends and our managements judgement on the
collectibility of these accounts as we generally receive premiums during the
month in which services are provided the allowance is typically not significant
in comparison to total premium revenue and does not have a material impact on
the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial position or
results of operations from 1998 to 2000 however we provided medicaid services
in certain regions of indiana as a subcontractor with maxicare indiana inc in
june 2001 the insurance commissioner of the indiana department of insurance
declared maxicare insolvent and ordered maxicare into liquidation as a result
we recorded an allowance for uncollectible receivables in the amount of 27
million to fully reserve for all receivables from maxicare as of december 31
2001 in 2002 subsequent to a release and settlement agreement with maxicare
and the indiana insurance commissioner which requires no payment by either
maxicare or us we wrote off the entire balance of the receivable from maxicare
as uncollectible and reduced the related allowance for doubtful accounts

     in 2002 our membership increased by 24000 members in texas due to the
purchase of schip contract rights from texas university health plan in
addition two smaller plans exited the austin texas market as a result our
texas plan increased its membership by 28000 lives this increase includes
12000 lives that we are managing for the state of texas on an interim basis and
that will become part of a reprocurement process scheduled for mid 2003 we
entered the new jersey market through our acquisition of 80 of the equity of
uhp membership increases in our wisconsin and indiana markets resulted from
additions to our provider network and growth in the number of medicaid
beneficiaries

     in 2001 our membership in indiana declined due to a subcontracting
provider organization terminating a percentofpremium arrangement which was
our only contract of that type separately we entered into agreements with
humana that resulted in the transfer to us of 35000 members in wisconsin and
30000 members in texas

     in 2000 a competitor in our wisconsin market terminated its participation
in the medicaid program benefiting our enrollment growth our membership growth
in the northern and central regions of indiana was offset by our decision to
reduce our participation in the southern region our el paso health plan
achieved sizable growth because we were named the default health plan in this
area and enrolled a majority of the members who failed to select a specific
plan

operating expenses

     our operating expenses include medical services costs and general and
administrative expenses

     our medical services costs include payments to physicians hospitals and
other providers for healthcare and specialty product claims medical service
costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported
or ibnr monthly we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors including
inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience as part of this
review we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of
amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing
patterns membership products and inpatient hospital trends these estimates
are adjusted as more information becomes available we utilize the services of
consultants who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly while we
believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound we cannot
assure you that healthcare claim costs will not exceed our estimates

     our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related
to health benefits and to predict accurately costs incurred the table below
depicts our health benefits ratio which represents medical services costs as a
percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the
premium received and the medical services provided our stabilization in the
ratio primarily reflects improved provider contract terms premium rate
increases in our markets served and member reductions in our southern indiana
market



                                                              year ended december 31

health benefits ratio  823    828    843


     our general and administrative expenses primarily reflect wages and
benefits and other administrative costs related to our employee base including
those fees incurred to provide services to our members some of these services
are provided locally while others are delivered to our health plans from a
centralized location this approach provides the opportunity to control both
direct and indirect costs the major centralized functions are claims
processing information systems finance medical management support and
administration the following table sets forth the general and administrative
expense ratio which represents general and administrative expenses as a percent
of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the
costs necessary to drive those revenues



                                                              year ended december 31

general and administrative expenses ratio  109    116    146


     the improvement in the general and administrative expenses ratio reflects
growth in membership and leveraging of our overall infrastructure for example
the decrease in our general and administrative ratio over the past two years in
part reflects our efforts to increase claims processing efficiencies through our
centralized support functions as a result our days in claims payable which is
a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the quarter divided by
average claims expense per calendar day for such quarter decreased from 734
days at december 31 2001 to 718 at december 31 2002 net of the effects of
our acquisition of 80 of the capital stock of uhp on december 1 2002 our days
in claims payable at december 31 2002 would have been 645 days

other income expense

     other income expense consists principally of investment and other income
interest expense and equity in earnings losses from joint ventures

      investment income is derived from our cash cash equivalents and
       investments information about our investments is presented below under
       liquidity and capital resources

      interest expense reported in 2002 represents commitment fees paid to a
       bank in conjunction with our undrawn credit facility interest expense
       reported in 2001 and 2000 primarily reflected interest paid on our
       subordinated notes which we repaid in full in december 2001

      equity in earnings losses from joint ventures principally represented
       our share of operating results from superior healthplan which we formed
       with community health centers network in 1997 from 1998 through 2000 we
       owned 39 of superior and therefore accounted for the investment under
       the equity method of accounting effective january 1 2001 we entered
       into an agreement to purchase an additional 51 of superior we also
       agreed to purchase from tachc gp inc a term note pursuant to which
       superior owed tachc 160000 as a result of entering into this
       agreement we began accounting for our investment in superior using
       consolidation accounting we therefore no longer reflect any operations
       of superior in equity in earnings losses from joint ventures and we
       eliminate in consolidation all administrative fees from superior in
       addition in december 2001 we acquired the remaining 10 equity interest
       in superior in exchange for 7143 shares of our common stock

                          critical accounting policies

     our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 3 to
our consolidated financial statements two of our accounting policies are
particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of
operations and require the application of significant judgment by our
management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty

medical claims liabilities

     our medical services costs include estimates for claims received but not
yet adjudicated estimates for claims incurred but not yet received and
estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims we together with
our independent actuaries estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial
methods based upon historical data for payment patterns cost trends product
mix seasonality utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments if necessary are
reflected in the period known

     in applying this policy our management uses its judgment to determine the
assumptions to be used in the determination of the required estimates while we
believe these estimates are appropriate it is possible future events could
require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates the
estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts
our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers
and information available from other outside sources as appropriate

     the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows



                                                     2002            2001            2000

acquisitions in 2002 include reserves acquired in connection with our
acquisition of 80 of the outstanding capital stock of uhp acquisitions in 2001
include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of the remaining
shares of superior healthplan

     changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years recognized during
2002 2001 and 2000 were attributable to favorable development in all of our
markets including lower than anticipated utilization of medical services

intangible assets

     we have made several acquisitions over the past two years that collectively
have resulted in our recording of a significant amount of intangible assets
these intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the fair market value
of net assets acquired in purchase transactions and consist of purchased
contract rights provider contracts and goodwill purchased contract rights are
amortized using the straightline method over periods ranging from 60 to 120
months provider contracts are amortized using the straightline method over 120
months

                                        20

     our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that
may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining
balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets impairment of an
intangible asset is triggered when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
excluding interest charges do not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible
asset and related goodwill if the events or circumstances indicate that the
remaining balance of the intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently
impaired the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference
between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill and the fair
value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows
excluding interest charges generated from the use and ultimate disposition of
the respective acquired entity our management must make assumptions and
estimates such as the discount factor in determining the estimated fair
values while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate other
assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly
different results

     effective january 1 2002 we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance
with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is reviewed
at least annually for impairment in addition we will perform an impairment
analysis of intangible assets more frequently based on other factors these
factors would include significant changes in membership state funding medical
contracts and provider networks and contracts we did not recognize any
impairment losses during 2000 2001 or 2002

basis across our markets

     administrative services fees for the year ended december 31 2002 increased
72000 or 187 to 457000 from 385000 in 2001 this increase resulted

  other income

     other income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 60 million
or 1681 to 95 million from 36 million in 2001 a majority of the increase
is due to the receipt of a onetime dividend of 51 million from a captive
insurance company in which we maintained an investment in addition investment
income increased due to a larger amount of dollars invested and interest
expense decreased year over year due to the repayment of our subordinated debt
in december 2001

156 million or an effective tax rate of 380 this compares to 91 million

91 million based on a 415 effective tax rate for the year ended december

     in addition we will acquire the remaining equity of uhp by no later than
december 1 2005 as described under managements discussion and analysis of
financial conditions and results of operations  overview

     in may 2002 we entered into a 25 million revolving line of credit
facility with lasalle bank na the line of credit has a term of one year and
has interest rates based on prime floating and libor rates we granted a
security interest in the common stock of our subsidiaries the facility includes
financial covenants including requirements of minimum ebitda and minimum
tangible net worth we are required to obtain lasalles consent of any proposed
acquisition that would result in a violation of any of the covenants contained
in the line of credit as of december 31 2002 we were in compliance with all
covenants and no funds had been drawn on the facility

                                        23

     at december 31 2002 we had working capital of 88 million as compared
to 357 million at december 31 2001 and 53 million at december 31 2000
our working capital is negative at times due to our efforts to increase
investment returns through purchases of longterm investments which have
maturities of greater than one year and therefore are classified as longterm
our investment policies are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve
capital we manage our shortterm and longterm investments to ensure that a
sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold
to fund working capital as needed

     cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 692 million at
december 31 2002 and 900 million at december 31 2001 longterm investments
were 954 million at december 31 2002 and 223 million at december 31 2001
including restricted deposits of 158 million and 12 million respectively
cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled 520 million at
december 31 2002 based on our operating plan we expect that our cash cash
equivalents and investments cash from our operations and cash available under
our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital
expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this report

                  regulatory capital and dividend restrictions

     our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries most of which are
subject to state regulations that among other things require the maintenance
of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state additional
regulations and restrict the timing payment and amount of dividends and other
distributions that may be paid to us

     our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements
prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we
operate as of december 31 2002 our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory
capital and surplus of 369 million compared with the required minimum
aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 220 million

     the national association of insurance commissioners adopted guidelines
which set minimum riskbased capital requirements for insurance companies
managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare
coverage wisconsin and texas adopted various forms of the rules as of december
31 1999 as of december 31 2002 our wisconsin and texas health plans were in
compliance with riskbased capital requirements the managed care organization
rules if adopted by indiana and new jersey may increase the minimum capital
required for these subsidiaries we continue to monitor these requirements and
do not expect that they will have a material impact on earnings or cash flows

                        recent accounting pronouncements

     in july 2001 sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets was
issued which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives no longer be amortized but instead tested at least annually for
impairment we have adopted sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 and goodwill
amortization was discontinued for the year ended december 31 2001 this
adjustment would have added 471000 in net earnings or 006 per diluted share
and 034 per basic share for the year ended december 31 2000 this adjustment
would have added 224000 in net earnings or 003 per diluted share and 025
per basic share goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in
addition we will perform an impairment analysis of intangible assets more
frequently based on other factors such factors would include but would not be
limited to significant changes in membership state funding medicaid contracts
and provider networks and contracts we did not recognize any impairment losses
for the periods presented

     in august 2001 sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of

     each fiscal year the company performs an analysis to estimate the amount
     owed to the state of wisconsin if any under the performance guarantees
     the state of wisconsin however does not calculate or request payment for
     the amount owed until at least thirteen months subsequent to each year end

                           forwardlooking statements

     this report contains forwardlooking statements that relate to future
events or our future financial performance we have attempted to identify these
statements by terminology including believe anticipate plan expect
estimate intend seek goal may will should can continue
or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements
include statements about our market opportunity our growth strategy
competition expected activities and future acquisitions and investments and
the adequacy of our available cash resources these statements may be found in
the sections of this report entitled managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations and business readers are
cautioned that matters subject to forwardlooking statements involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties including economic regulatory competitive and
other factors that may cause our or our industrys actual results levels of
activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future
results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by
these forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions

     actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of
important factors our results of operations and projections of future earnings
depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health
benefits and other operating expenses a variety of factors including
competition changes in health care practices changes in federal or state laws
and regulations or their interpretations inflation provider contract changes
new technologies governmentimposed surcharges taxes or assessments reduction
in provider payments by governmental payers major epidemics disasters and
numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare such as
major healthcare providers inability to maintain their operations may in the
future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating
expenses governmental action or business conditions could result in premium
revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other
operating expenses once set premiums are generally fixed for one year periods
and accordingly unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered
through higher premiums the expiration cancellation or suspension of our
medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively
impact us due to these factors and risks we cannot give assurances with
respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future
medical costs

                     factors that may affect future results

risks related to being a regulated entity

  reductions in medicaid funding could substantially reduce our profitability

     nearly all of our revenues come from medicaid premiums the base premium
rate paid by each state differs depending on a combination of factors such as
defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or
region benefit mix and member eligibility categories future levels of medicaid
premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical
costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints
changes to medicaid programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or
eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our

                                        26
page

administrative or healthcare costs under those programs states periodically
consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid
we believe that additional reductions in medicaid payments could substantially
reduce our profitability further our contracts with the states are subject to
cancellation by the state immediately or after a short notice period in the
event of unavailability of state funds

  if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed our
  business will suffer

     we provide managed care programs and select services to individuals
receiving benefits under medicaid including ssi and schip we provide these
healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in
which we operate the contracts expire on various dates between june 30 2003
and december 31 2003 our contracts with the states of indiana and wisconsin
accounted for 73 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 our
contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by
state regulatory agencies in addition the indiana contract under which we
operate can be terminated by the state without cause our contracts are
generally intended to run for two years and may be extended for one or two
additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so when our
contracts expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare
providers there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended
if any of our contracts is terminated not renewed or renewed on less favorable
terms our business will suffer and our operating results may be materially
affected

  changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members
  rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could
  harm our business

     our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and
by the federal government the applicable laws and regulations are subject to
frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan
providers and members rather than stockholders changes in existing laws and
rules the enactment of new laws and rules and changing interpretations of
these laws and rules could among other things

      force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our
       network

      require us to implement additional or different programs and systems

      mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premiums
       revenues

      restrict revenue and enrollment growth

      require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of
       our providers

      increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional
       capital and reserve requirements and

      increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice
       by our providers

     for example congress has considered various forms of patient protection
legislation commonly known as patients bills of rights we cannot predict the
impact of this legislation if adopted on our business

  regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans

     our texas plans are required to pay a rebate to the state in the event
profits exceed established levels to date no rebates have been required this
regulatory requirement changes in this requirement or the adoption of similar
requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our
overall profits as a percentage of revenues the state of texas has implemented
and is enforcing a penalty provision for failure to pay claims in a timely
manner failure to meet this requirement can result in financial fines and
penalties in addition states may attempt to reduce their contract premium
rates if regulators perceive our medical loss ratio as too low any of these
regulatory actions could harm our operating results

     also on january 18 2002 cms published a final rule that removed an
exception contained in the federal medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting
states to reimburse nonstate governmentowned or operated hospitals for
inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to 150 percent of a
reasonable estimate
                                        27
page

of the amount that would be paid for the services furnished by these hospitals
under medicaid payment principles this development in federal law could
decrease the profitability of our health plans

  failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and
  criminal penalties

     federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other
laws to protect patients privacy and access to healthcare violation of these
and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our
providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the
cancellation of our contracts to provide services the suspension or revocation
of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid ssi and
schip programs because of these potential sanctions we seek to monitor our
compliance and that of our providers with federal and state fraud and abuse and
other healthcare laws on an ongoing basis these penalties or exclusions were
they to occur as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to
monitor the compliance of our providers would negatively impact our ability to
operate our business for example failure to pay our providers promptly could
result in the imposition of fines and other penalties in some states we may be
subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority which may impose
overlapping or inconsistent regulations

     hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare
companies hipaa created civil penalties for among other things billing for
medically unnecessary goods or services hipaa established new enforcement
mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including a whistle blower program
further hipaa imposes civil and in some instances criminal penalties for
failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and
electronic transmission of individuallyidentifiable health information
congress may enact additional legislation to increase penalties and to create a
private right of action under hipaa which would entitle patients to seek
monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules

  compliance with new government regulations may require us to make significant
  expenditures

     in august 2000 hhs issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use
of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and
payment transactions submitted or received electronically we are required to
comply with the new regulation by october 2003 and texas has indicated that it
may impose an earlier compliance deadline in august 1998 hhs proposed a
regulation that would require healthcare participants to implement
organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically
maintained or transmitted healthrelated information in december 2000 hhs
issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality
protections under hipaa that became effective on april 14 2001 compliance with
this regulation will be required by april 14 2003

     the bush administrations issuance of new regulations and its review of
existing regulations the states ability to promulgate stricter rules and
uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations may make compliance with
the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult our existing programs and
systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with these new regulations
in order to comply with the regulatory requirements we will be required to
employ additional or different programs and systems the costs of which are not
expected to exceed 500000 in 2003 further compliance with these regulations
would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our
business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified we
do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to recover our
costs of complying with these new regulations from the states the new
regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse
effect on our business

  changes in healthcare law may reduce our profitability

     numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been
introduced some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which
we operate or may operate in the future changes in applicable laws and
regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing
laws and rules may also change from time to time we are unable to predict what
regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on
our business these changes could reduce the number of persons

                                        28
page

enrolled or eligible for medicaid and reduce the reimbursement or payment levels
for medical services more generally we are unable to predict whether new laws
or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare

     we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals
or the effect that they will have on us legislation or regulations that require
us to change our current manner of operation provide additional benefits or
change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial
results

  changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability

     in february 2003 the bush administration proposed a major longterm change
in the way medicaid and schip are funded the proposal if adopted would allow
states to elect to receive combined medicaidschip allotments for acute and
longterm health care for lowincome uninsured persons participating states
would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs
subject to federallymandated minimum coverage requirements it is uncertain
whether this proposal will be enacted or if so how it may change from the
initial proposal accordingly it is unknown whether or how many states might
elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of
funding available for medicaid and schip programs if such a proposal is adopted
and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states
in which we operate or reduces the volume of health care services provided our
growth operations and financial performance could be adversely affected

  if we are unable to participate in schip programs our growth rate may be
  limited

     schip is a relatively new federal initiative designed to provide coverage
for lowincome children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance
programs the programs vary significantly from state to state participation in
schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy if states do not
allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate our growth
strategy may be materially and adversely affected

  if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by
  our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our
  business strategy

     we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries if funds
normally available to us become limited in the future we may need to rely on
dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations these
subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and
distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification
to state regulators if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries request
to pay dividends to us the funds available to our company as a whole would be
limited this could harm our ability to implement our business strategy

risks related to our business

  receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively affect our revenues and
  profitability

     nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed
monthly payments per member these premiums are fixed by contract and we are
obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as
established by the state governments we use a large portion of our revenues to
pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our customers if premiums do
not increase when expenses related to medical services rise our earnings would
be affected negatively in addition our actual medical services costs may
exceed our estimates which would cause our health benefits ratio or our
expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues to
increase and our profits to decline in addition it is possible for a state to
increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding
increase in premiums to us if this were to occur in one or more of the states
in which we operate our profitability would be harmed

                                        29

  failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative
  costs would reduce our profitability

     our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to
predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits we have less
control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general
and administrative expenses historically our health benefits ratio has varied
for example our health benefits ratio was 823 for 2002 828 for 2001 and
843 for 2000 but was 889 for 1999 and 884 for 1998 because of the narrow
margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our health
benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results changes
in healthcare regulations and practices the level of use of healthcare
services hospital costs pharmaceutical costs major epidemics new medical
technologies and other external factors including general economic conditions
such as inflation levels are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to
predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits we may
not be able to manage costs effectively in the future if our costs related to
health benefits increase our profits could be reduced or we may not remain
profitable

  failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our
  reported results

     our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr we estimate our ibnr
medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors adjustments if
necessary are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual
claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr
change we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that
adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations from
time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates
particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members our
failure to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect our ability to take timely
corrective actions further harming our results

  difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our
  business

     historically the acquisition of medicaid businesses contract rights and
related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in
new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth for example
our acquisition of 80 of the equity of uhp on december 1 2002 accounted for
303 of the increase in our membership for the year ended december 31 2002
compared to 2001 many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have
greater financial resources than we have in addition many of the sellers are
interested either in 1 selling along with their medicaid assets other assets
in which we do not have an interest or 2 selling their companies including
their liabilities as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses

     we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more
state agencies when making acquisitions in the case of an acquisition of a
business located in a state in which we do not currently operate we would be
required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state in addition
even if we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business we
would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition
would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not
operate previously we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with
these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner or at all
in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition state regulators may
consider a number of factors outside our control including giving preference to
competing offers made by locally owned entities or by notforprofit entities
furthermore our credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the
consent of our bank lender

     in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating
acquisitions we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired
business or assets with our existing operations this may include the
integration of

      additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and
       corporate culture

      existing provider networks which may operate on different terms than our
       existing networks

                                        30
page

      existing members who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan
       and

      disparate administrative accounting and finance and information
       systems

     accordingly we may be unable to successfully identify consummate and
integrate future acquisitions or operate acquired businesses profitably we also
may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future
acquisitions if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy
our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed

  failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively
  affect our results of operations

     startup costs associated with a new business can be substantial for
example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we
must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate
our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims if we were
unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license winning the bid to provide
service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs any new
business of ours would fail we also could be obligated by the state to continue
to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover
our ongoing costs or recover startup costs in addition we may not be able to
effectively commercialize any new programs or services we seek to market to
third parties the expenses associated with starting up a new business could
have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to
achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion

  we derive all of our revenues from operations in four states and our
  operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in revenues or
  profitability in any one of those states

     operations in wisconsin indiana texas and new jersey account for all of
our revenues if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states
or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were
significantly curtailed our revenues would decrease materially in the first
half of 2001 our membership in indiana declined by approximately 46000 due to
a subcontracting provider organization terminating a percentofpremium
arrangement in 2000 we reduced our service area in wisconsin from 36 to 18
counties our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause
our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on
legislative actions economic conditions and similar factors in those states
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate
would harm our business

  competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that
  we serve

     we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of
provider network benefits provided and quality of service we compete with
numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional
state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided subject to
limited exceptions by federally approved state applications the federal
government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed
care programs voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability
to increase our market share

     some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and
other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do in addition
significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care
industry as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the
hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information
systems industries to the extent that competition intensifies in any market
that we serve our ability to retain or increase members and providers or
maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over
medical cost trends may be adversely affected

     in addition in order to increase our membership in the markets we
currently serve we believe that we must continue to develop and implement
communityspecific products alliances with key providers and localized outreach
and educational programs if we are unable to develop and implement these
initiatives or

                                        31
page

if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so we may not be
able to further penetrate our existing markets

  if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our provider
  networks our profitability will be harmed

     our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract
favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers our
provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and
hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to
120 days prior written notice we cannot guarantee that we will be able to
continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us
to service our members profitably

     from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to
terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us
even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual
terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers it is
possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully
regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have
merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our
managements attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may
be unable to operate our business effectively

     we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to
entering new markets we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers
in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms if we are unable to
retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts
timely or on favorable terms our profitability will be harmed

  we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel

     we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified
personnel to operate and expand our medicaid managed care business if we lose
one or more members of our senior management team including our chief executive
officer michael f neidorff who has been instrumental in developing our
mission and forging our business relationships our business and operating
results could be harmed we do not have an employment agreement with mr
neidorff and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain his services
our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other
key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because
of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care industry with
the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and expand successfully
a business such as ours competition to hire from this limited pool is intense
and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel

  negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business
  and operating results

     recently the managed care industry has received negative publicity this
publicity has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry
practices and private litigation in the commercial sector these factors may
adversely affect our ability to market our services require us to change our
services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate any of
these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our
operating results

  claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant
  expenses

     our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be
subject to medical malpractice claims some states including texas have
adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable
for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations in
addition plaintiffs in cases pending in federal courts are seeking to hold
managed care organizations liable for denying medically necessary treatment and
denying or delaying payments for services performed claims of this nature if
successful could result in substantial damage awards against us and our
providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage
therefore successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us our
                                        32
page

providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and
profitability even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without
merit they would still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our
managements attention as a result we may incur significant expenses and may
be unable to operate our business effectively

  growth in the number of medicaideligible persons during economic downturns
  could cause our operating results and stock prices to suffer if state and
  federal budgets decrease or do not increase

     less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as
more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits during such economic
downturns however state and federal budgets could decrease causing states to
attempt to cut healthcare programs benefits and rates in particular we cannot
predict the impact of acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or
state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the medicaideligible
population if federal funding were decreased or unchanged while our membership
was increasing our results of operations would suffer

  growth in the number of medicaideligible persons may be countercyclical
  which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic
  conditions are improving

     historically the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits
has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment corresponding
to less favorable general economic conditions conversely this number may grow
more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve therefore
improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to
decrease thereby causing our operating results to suffer which could lead to
decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are
increasing

  we intend to expand primarily into markets where medicaid recipients are
  required to enroll in managed care plans

     we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid
enrollment in managed care is mandatory currently approximately twothirds of
the states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in
all or a portion of their counties the programs are voluntary in other states
because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment we expect the
geographic expansion of our business to be limited to those states

  if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively
  our operations could be disrupted

     our operations depend significantly on effective information systems the
information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in
among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing
provider claims and providing data to our regulators our providers also depend
upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and
other information

     our information systems and applications require continual maintenance
upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs moreover our
acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from and the
integration of various information systems we regularly upgrade and expand our
information systems capabilities if we experience difficulties with the
transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or
expand our information systems we could suffer among other things from
operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting
new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses in
addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be
impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature
such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists

  we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance

     we maintain liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles for
claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and
related services these claims could be substantial we
                                        33

believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover
currently estimated exposures we cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we
will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

                                  investments

     as of december 31 2002 we had shortterm investments of 96 million and
longterm investments of 954 million including restricted deposits of 158
million the shortterm investments consist of highly liquid securities with
maturities between three and 12 months the longterm investments consist of
municipal bonds us governmentbacked agencies and us treasury investments
and have original maturities greater than one year restricted deposits consist
of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to
state agencies these investments are classified as longterm regardless of the
contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements these
investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
market rates increase we have the ability to hold these shortterm investments
to maturity and as a result we would not expect the value of these investments
to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest
rates assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest
rates at december 31 2002 the fair value of our fixed income investments would
decrease by approximately 26 million similarly a 1 decrease in market
interest rates at december 31 2002 would result in an increase of the fair
value of our investments of approximately 26 million declines in interest
rates over time will reduce our investment income

                                   inflation

     although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and
healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years the national
healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate we use
various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost
inflation specifically our health plans try to control medical and hospital
costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services
through these contracted care providers our health plans emphasize preventive
healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services

     while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost
inflation will continue to be successful competitive pressures new healthcare
and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from healthcare providers and
customers applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to
control the impact of healthcare cost increases

                                compliance costs

     federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic
transactions data security and confidentiality of patient information have been
issued recently due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements
we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will
comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted
implementation of additional systems and programs will be required the cost of
which we estimate not to exceed 500000 in 2003 further compliance with these
regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to
conduct our business which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet
identified we do not know whether or the extent to which we will be able to
recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states
