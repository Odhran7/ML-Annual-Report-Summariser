revenue components 

we generate the majority of our revenues through companyoperated stores and licensed stores 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of october 2 2022 

the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 82 of total net revenues during fiscal 2022 our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience is built upon superior customer service convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets as well as increasing sales in existing stores to support our longterm strategic objective to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including expected financial returns the maturity of the market economic conditions consumer behavior and local business environment 

companyoperated store data for the fiscal yearended october 2 2022 

starbucks companyoperated stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and rural and offhighway locations we are continuing the expansion of our stores particularly drivethru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience and alternative store formats which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11 of total net revenues in fiscal 2022 licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model 

in our licensed store operations we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores in a limited number of international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

licensed store data for the fiscal yearended october 2 2022 

other revenues 

other revenues primarily are recorded in our channel development segment and include sales of packaged coffee tea and readytodrink beverages to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores as well as royalties received from nestlé under the global coffee alliance and other collaborative partnerships 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations nestlé controls distribution of certain finished goods through the global coffee alliance we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and singleorigin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain natural disasters crop disease and pests general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee we also utilize forward contracts futures contracts and collars to hedge “c” price exposure under our pricetobefixed green coffee contracts and our longterm forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts are not yet available total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2023 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates ten farmer support centers including our china farmer support center located in the yunnan province of 

table of contents 

this highgrowth market farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy and plantbased dairyfree alternative products particularly fluid milk oat milk and almond milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy and plantbased dairyfree suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk and plantbased dairyfree alternatives to support our stores generally is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote 

during fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022 we experienced certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors while we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2023 we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our longterm growth and profitability 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality brand reputation service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector and the readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to both wellestablished and startup companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo starbucks reserve and frappuccino are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately seven years in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” and “starbucksreservecom” 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income the covid19 pandemic has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic however it is not yet certain that these changes will sustain and cause other than temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

as a company with global operations we are subject to the laws and regulations of the united states and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies which may differ among jurisdictions in addition changes to such laws regulations rules reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

• our financial condition and results of operations are subject to and may be adversely affected by a number of macroeconomic and other factors many of which are also largely outside our control 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition andor results of operations 

• increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets 

• inflationary pressures 

• disruptions to our supply chain

• changes in climate including changes to the frequency of severe weather events that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services energy and other materials throughout our supply chain and 

• especially in our largest markets including the us and china labor discord or disruption geopolitical events war terrorism including incidents targeting us political instability acts of public violence boycotts increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores 

• economic conditions in the us and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions a continued economic downturn or recession or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors’ lowerpriced products as a result of various factors including job losses inflation higher taxes reduced access to credit changes in federal economic policy the covid19 pandemic and recent international trade disputes due to the covid19 pandemic or other global health events we may experience a reduction and increased volatility in demand for our products such reductions and volatility may be caused by among other things store closures or modified operating hours and business model reduced customer traffic due to illness quarantine or government or selfimposed

restrictions placed on our stores’ operations impacts caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors including those caused by social distancing a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic or any other public health emergency persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

• failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to our operational and financial results and expectations regarding the success of our reinvention plan and related guidance environmental performance and shareholder returns will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

risks related to covid19 

• our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is continuing to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations at the peak of the covid19 outbreak many of our companyoperated and licensed stores were closed for stores that remained open samestore sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic while nearly all of our companyoperated and licensed stores have reopened we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of covid19 including resurgences and variants of the virus our china market experienced unprecedented covid19 pandemicrelated restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility it remains difficult to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change and whether such change is temporary or permanent social distancing telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal in addition the covid19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures such as vaccinations showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings that could impact our results including by impacting our brand our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products all of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance as a result we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory store and corporate assets—and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited—any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results 

prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants 

risks related to our business 

if our business partners and thirdparty providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer 

our global business strategy including our plans for new stores branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly for our entire global channel development business licensees retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or companyoperated store so we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these licensees and other business partners however the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial constraints adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance including those resulting from the covid19 pandemic labor shortages and other factors we do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices

we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results 

• incidents involving food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling whether or not accurate as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products could harm our business 

instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions andor temporary store closures clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages as well as ice for our cold beverages and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error 

we also face risk by relying on thirdparty food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores while we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products there is greater risk from those we do not monitor or do not monitor as closely furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls potential food safety incidents whether at our stores or involving our business partners could lead to wide public exposure which could materially harm our business 

additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls viralcontaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

• we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives which includes our reinvention plan are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

• being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience 

• building our leadership position around coffee 

• driving convenience brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile loyalty delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally 

• simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers 

• increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats including the accelerated development of alternative store formats such as starbucks pickup stores starbucks now stores and curbside pickup especially in light of the covid19 pandemic 

• adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the covid19 pandemic inflation and changing economic conditions 

• moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more companyoperated model in certain markets

• creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup 

• continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners 

• delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business 

• working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business and 

• reducing our operating costs particularly general and administrative expenses 

in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results include the following 

• imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees 

• construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally 

• governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores including due to the covid19 pandemic or other public health emergencies 

• not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand including our emphasis on a broad range of highquality food offerings 

• not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change and 

• the deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals policies and standards if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives or in the event we undertake large acquisitions integrations and divestitures we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

• evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outsidethehome food and beverages such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick  mortar” retail stores lack of customer acceptance of new products including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs brands such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand and platforms such as features of our mobile technology changes in our loyalty rewards programs the starbucks odyssey experience and our delivery services initiatives or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced in addition some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations furthermore our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines changes to employer “workfromhome” policies reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products

risks related to brand relevance and brand execution 

• our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results 

we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food product recalls store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases such as covid19 safetyrelated incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media including for malicious reasons or result in litigation consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we our employees licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products act or are perceived to act in an unethical illegal raciallybiased unequal or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores treatment of employees or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes furthermore if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals executing on our reinvention plan or achieving relevant sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation additionally if we fail to comply with laws and regulations take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment our brand value may be diminished 

the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our social and environmental program goals as well as the success of the reinvention plan which requires companywide coordination and alignment we are working to manage risks and costs to us our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources these risks include any increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters including packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them which could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks 

• we may not be successful in our marketing promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences we operate in a complex and costly marketing promotional and advertising environment our marketing promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising promotional and marketing resources across different channels including digital marketing allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them if the advertising promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales and market share could decrease 

finally customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations an inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

• failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

complex local state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement in addition our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to unexpected changes including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties 

table of contents 

significantly complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example europe’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” and the uk general data protection regulation which implements the gdpr into uk law impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance additionally california enacted legislation the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” the ccpa requires among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and allows such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal data the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation further the california privacy rights act which was passed in november 2020 and is fully effective in january 2023 significantly modifies the ccpa colorado connecticut utah and virginia recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that will also take effect in 2023 and several other states and countries are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term these modifications and new laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply 

in june 2021 the european commission published new versions of the standard contractual clauses and in march 2022 the uk finalized the uk international data transfer agreement the new requirements will require us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply and may impact the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties 

our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines damage to our brand reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business

such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy cyber and other laws or trigger us state data breach notification laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability 

significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents remedy cybersecurity problems recuperate lost data prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment these include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies additional security technologies trainings personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred

• increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established 

the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain natural disasters crop disease and pests general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices for example drought conditions in brazil have and given continued drought conditions are predicted to continue to impact coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance

suppliers to provide highquality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability 

risks related to human capital 

• changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs including wages and benefits which in a retail business such as ours are two of our most significant costs both domestically and internationally including those increases triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages scheduling and benefits increased healthcare and workers’ compensation insurance costs increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain highquality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages benefits and costs related to the covid19 pandemic the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently highquality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations furthermore we have experienced and could continue to experience a shortage of labor for store positions including due to market trends and conditions such as continued concerns around covid19 the availability of new telecommuting employment options and other factors which could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions such labor shortages could be further exacerbated by expanded covid19 vaccination requirements in addition our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent starting in december 2021 starbucks partners at companyoperated stores in multiple jurisdictions across the us began filing for unionization elections and a number of these stores have now successfully unionized with potentially more to follow while the number of partners represented by unions is not significant if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs change our employee culture decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business additionally our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business including on our financial results these responses could also expose us to legal risk causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions potential penalties and restrictions or reputational harm 

• the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results

environmental social and governance risk factors 

• our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations including with respect to environmental social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the financial accounting standards board these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain in addition increasingly regulators customers investors employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental social and governance “esg” matters and related disclosures these changing rules regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations for example developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of esg and

collecting measuring and reporting esg related information and metrics can be costly difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards including the sec’s recently proposed climaterelated reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies we may also communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental matters diversity responsible sourcing and social investments and other esg related matters in our sec filings or in other public disclosures these initiatives and goals within the scope of esg could be difficult and expensive to implement the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace and we could be criticized for the accuracy adequacy or completeness of the disclosure further statements about our esg related initiatives and goals and progress against those goals may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future in addition we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals if our esgrelated data processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of esg on a timely basis or at all our reputation business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

• climate change may have an adverse impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners including within our supply chain that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted for example as we noted above the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather and water supply quality and availability which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change we operate in 83 markets globally while we believe this geographic diversity is likely to lessen the impact of individual climate change related events on our financial results our properties and operations may nonetheless be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts such events have the potential to disrupt our operations cause store closures disrupt the business of our thirdparty suppliers and impact our customers all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

risks related to competition 

• we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such as delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ® stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors or competition from large new entrants or wellfunded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment in addition not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors we may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability additionally if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods or our competitors respond more effectively this could have a negative effect on our business furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products flattening demand for our products changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business

• we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets 

our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns along with our north america segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income china is currently our fastest growing market our second largest market overall and 100 companyowned due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risks in china including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following

• escalating uschina tension and increasing political sensitivities in china 

• the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china including chinas “zero covid” policy 

• entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china 

• changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class wages labor inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs 

• ongoing government regulatory reform including relating to public health food safety tariffs and tax sustainability and responses to climate change which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs and 

• foodsafety related matters including compliance with foodsafety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations 

• we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in 83 markets globally our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies 

• changes or uncertainties in economic legal regulatory social and political conditions in our markets as well as negative effects on us businesses due to increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets 

• interpretation and application of laws and regulations including tax tariffs labor merchandise antibribery and privacy laws and regulations 

• restrictive actions of foreign or us governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment especially during periods of heightened tension between the us and such foreign governmental authorities including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership 

• import or other business licensing requirements 

• the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new us and international regulations 

table of contents 

• in developing economies the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural differences as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining highquality employees in local markets 

• local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employees 

• local regulations health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic affecting our operations and 

• delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and in turn negatively impact net revenues operating income and earnings per share 

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

risks related to governmental and regulatory changes 

• failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results 

our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare food and beverage sanitation safety environmental labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of noncompliance changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners which could affect our profitability furthermore due to the covid‑19 pandemic we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines as well as any other voluntary safety protocols 

in addition our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving us and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the gdpr and the ccpa discussed in more detail in this risk factors section and other applicable international and us privacy laws or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect and use data require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business 

the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 27 2020 included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” can be found in the annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 3 2021 

overview 

we have three reportable operating segments 1 north america which is inclusive of the us and canada 2 international which is inclusive of china japan asia pacific europe middle east africa latin america and the caribbean and 3 channel development nonreportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within corporate and other 

our financial results and longterm growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings comparable store sales and margin management we believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics 

• new store openings and store count 

• comparable store sales 

• operating margin 

starbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand consolidated revenues increased 11 to 323 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 291 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by strength in our us business and growth in our international segment excluding china partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 496 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation 

for both the north america segment and us market comparable store sales increased 12 for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22 and 21 for the north america segment and the us market respectively in fiscal 2021 average ticket for the north america segment and the us market grew 7 and 8 respectively primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our us market the segment also experienced higher costs primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain in fiscal 2022 we announced our reinvention plan in the us market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience we believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purposebuilt store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers 

for the international segment comparable store sales decreased by 9 for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16 in fiscal 2021 driven by comparable store sales decline of 24 in our china market during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 our china market experienced covid19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility outside of china strong growth in our major international markets driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities partially offset the unfavorability in our china market 

revenue for our channel development segment increased 250 million or 16 when compared with fiscal 2021 driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the global coffee alliance and growth in our global readytodrink business operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 443 primarily due to a decline in our north american coffee partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift 

despite covid19 induced business interruptions especially in our china market we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio we expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023 relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics including operating margin as compared to fiscal 2022 we anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our reinvention plan absent significant and prolonged covid19 relapses or global economic disruptions and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the reinvention plan we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable profitable growth over the longterm

cash used in investing activities totaled 21 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to 03 billion for fiscal 2021 the change was primarily driven by lapping the net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our south korea joint venture and an increase in spend on capital expenditures 

cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2022 totaled 56 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of 37 billion for fiscal 2021 the change was primarily due to resuming our share repurchase program partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of longterm debt

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk which we consider to be low we use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances we also use crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in japan excluding interest rate hedging instruments cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates and note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

table of contents 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs primarily coffee dairy products diesel cocoa sugar and other commodities that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2 2022 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  

foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the chinese renminbi japanese yen canadian dollar british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items the volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2 2022 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  

equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october 2 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of october 2 2022

1 amount disclosed is net of 28 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap refer to note 3  derivative financial instruments for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge 

availableforsale debt securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of october 2 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain especially in light of the current economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise we believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity for the reasons discussed below 

table of contents 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment operating lease rightofuse “rou” assets and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level which is inclusive of property plant and equipment and lease rou assets the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store the fair value of a store’s rou asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

in fiscal 2022 we announced our reinvention plan in the us market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience as a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the reinvention plan we recorded an immaterial impairment charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended october 2 2022 future impairment charges attributed to our reinvention plan are not expected to be material 

in fiscal 2021 we substantially completed our plan to reposition our north america store portfolio primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences during fiscal year 2021 we recorded approximately 1554 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings these totals included 531 million related to disposal and impairment of companyoperated store assets and 895 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of rou lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms as this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021 we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended october 2 2022 

asset impairment charges are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance 

table of contents 

and forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value and absent a sustained multiyear global decline in our business in key markets such as the us and china we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing which was completed in the third fiscal quarter resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed was in excess of carrying value of approximately 95 billion for the business units where a quantitative analysis on impairment was performed when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months 

definitelived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in note 8  other intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 14  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we do not expect a significant amount of the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2023 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities  

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated while we do not expect to

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results including forecasted business performance could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

revenue components 

we generate the majority of our revenues through companyoperated stores and licensed stores 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of october 3 2021 

the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 85 of total net revenues during fiscal 2021 our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience is built upon superior customer service convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets as well as increasing sales in existing stores to support our longterm strategic objective to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including expected financial returns the maturity of the market economic conditions consumer behavior and local business practices 

companyoperated store data for the fiscal yearended october 3 2021 

starbucks ® companyoperated stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and rural and offhighway locations we are continuing the expansion of our stores particularly drivethru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience and alternative store formats which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas 

prior to the global covid19 pandemic approximately 80 of starbucks transactions in us companyoperated stores were “onthego” occasions this has prompted us to reexamine our us store footprint and evolve our retail presence over time 

table of contents 

through targeted store renovations relocations and new stores we have since introduced new store formats such as starbucks ® pickup starbucks now stores and curbside pickup to enhance the “onthego” customer experience and improve operating efficiency across starbucks ® stores in certain major metropolitan areas in the united states new store formats are suitable for customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the starbucks ® mobile app for pickup in our major international markets we continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience in china the introduction of starbucks now tm stores is intended to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints orders may be placed in advance through the starbucks mobile app or starbucks delivers tm and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations these strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences including higher levels of mobile ordering more contactless pickup experiences and reduced instore congestion all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing we believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position starbucks for longterm growth 

retail sales mix by product type for companyoperated stores 

1 “other” primarily consists of sales of packaged and singleserve coffees and teas serveware and readytodrink beverages among other items 

stored value cards and loyalty program 

the starbucks card our branded stored value card program is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders in part through the related starbucks ® rewards loyalty program where available as discussed below stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance they can be obtained in our companyoperated and most licensed stores in north america china japan and many of our markets in our international segment stored value cards can also be obtained online via the starbucks ® mobile app and through other us and international retailers customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the starbucks ® mobile app in participating stores in nearly all markets including the us and canada customers who register their starbucks cards are automatically enrolled in the starbucks rewards program registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points “stars” earned in addition to using their starbucks cards starbucks ® rewards members can earn stars by paying with cash credit or debit cards or selected mobile wallets at companyoperated stores in the us and canada using the mobile order and pay functionality of the starbucks ® mobile app customers can also place orders in advance for pickup at certain participating locations in several markets refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program 

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 9 of total net revenues in fiscal 2021 licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model 

in our licensed store operations we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores in a limited number of international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

licensed store data for the fiscal yearended october 3 2021 

1 north america and international licensed stores as of september 27 2020 have been recast as a result of our fiscal 2021 operating segment reporting structure realignment 

other revenues 

other revenues primarily are recorded in our channel development segment and include sales of packaged coffee tea and readytodrink beverages to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores as well as royalties received from nestlé under the global coffee alliance and other collaborative partnerships 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations nestlé controls distribution of certain finished goods through the global coffee alliance we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain natural disasters crop disease and pests general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee we also utilize forward contracts futures contracts and collars to hedge c price exposure under our pricetobefixed green coffee contracts and our longterm forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and pricetobefixed contracts are not yet available total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2022 

table of contents 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates ten farmer support centers including our china farmer support center located in the yunnan province of this highgrowth market farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy and plantbased dairyfree alternative products particularly fluid milk oat milk and almond milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy and plantbased dairyfree suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk and plantbased dairyfree alternatives to support our stores generally is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations consistent with our planetpositive vision we are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote 

during fiscal 2021 we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors while we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022 we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our longterm growth and profitability 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality brand reputation service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector and the readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to both wellestablished and startup companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo starbucks reserve seattle’s best coffee teavana and frappuccino are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately two years in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” “starbucksreservecom” “seattlesbestcom” and “teavanacom” 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income the covid19 pandemic has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic however it is not yet certain that these changes will sustain and cause other than temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected the considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well moreover the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

• our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is continuing to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations at the peak of the covid19 outbreak many of our companyoperated and licensed stores were closed for stores that remained open samestore sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic while nearly all of our companyoperated and licensed stores have reopened we expect that our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of covid19 including resurgences and variants of the virus it remains difficult to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change and whether such change is temporary or permanent social distancing telecommunicating and reductions in travel may become the new normal in addition the covid19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures such as vaccinations showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings that could impact our results including by impacting our brand our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products all of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide and could have continuing adverse effects on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition as a result we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory store and corporate assets—and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited—any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results 

prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants 

• our financial condition and results of operations are subject to and may be adversely affected by a number of other factors many of which are also largely outside our control 

in addition to the covid19 pandemic our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition andor results of operations 

• increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets 

table of contents 

• inflationary pressures 

• disruptions to our supply chain 

• changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• adverse outcomes of litigation 

• severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets 

• changes in climate including changes to the frequency of severe weather events that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services energy and other materials throughout our supply chain and 

• especially in our largest markets including the us and china labor discord or disruption geopolitical events war terrorism including incidents targeting us political instability acts of public violence boycotts increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores 

• economic conditions in the us and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors’ lowerpriced products as a result of various factors including job losses inflation higher taxes reduced access to credit changes in federal economic policy the covid19 pandemic and recent international trade disputes due to the covid19 pandemic or other global health events we may experience a reduction andor increased volatility in demand for our products which may be caused by among other things store closures or modified operating hours and business model reduced customer traffic due to illness quarantine or government or selfimposed restrictions placed on our stores’ operations impacts caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors eg continued practice of social distancing decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability or development plans which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

• failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to our operational and financial results and related guidance environmental performance and shareholder returns will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

risks related to brand relevance and brand execution 

• our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results 

we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food product recalls store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases such as covid19 or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section the impact of 

table of contents 

such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media including for malicious reasons or result in litigation consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we our employees licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products act or are perceived to act in an unethical illegal raciallybiased unequal or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores treatment of employees or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes furthermore if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals including our people and planetpositive work or achieving relevant sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer additionally if we fail to comply with laws and regulations take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment our brand value may be diminished 

the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our people and planetpositive initiatives which require companywide coordination and alignment we are working to manage risks and costs to us our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources these risks include any increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters including packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them which could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks 

• if our business partners and thirdparty providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer 

our global business strategy including our plans for new stores branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly for our entire global channel development business licensees retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or companyoperated store so we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these licensees and other business partners however the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial constraints caused by the covid19 pandemic and other factors we do not have direct control over our business partners including in their adherence to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the covid19 pandemic and may not have visibility into their practices 

we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results 

• incidents involving food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling whether or not accurate as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products could harm our business 

instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions andor temporary store closures clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages as well as ice for our cold beverages and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error 

we also face risk by relying on thirdparty food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores while we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products there is greater risk from those we do not monitor or do not monitor as closely furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls potential food safety incidents whether at our stores or involving our business partners could lead to wide public exposure which could materially harm our business 

table of contents 

additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls viralcontaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

• we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives which include our profit people and planetpositive visions are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

• being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience 

• building our leadership position around coffee 

• driving convenience brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile loyalty delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally 

• simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers 

• increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats including the accelerated development of alternative store formats such as starbucks ® pickup stores starbucks now stores and curbside pickup especially in light of the covid19 pandemic 

• adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the covid19 pandemic 

• moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more companyowned model in other markets

• delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business 

• working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business and 

• reducing our operating costs particularly general and administrative expenses 

in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results include the following 

• imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees 

• construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally 

• governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores including due to the covid19 pandemic or other public health emergencies 

• not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand including our emphasis on a broad range of highquality food offerings 

• not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change and 

• the deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals policies and standards if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives or in the event we undertake large acquisitions integrations and divestitures we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

• evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outsidethehome food and beverages such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick  mortar” retail stores lack of customer acceptance of new products including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs brands such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand and platforms such as features of our mobile technology changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced in addition some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations furthermore our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines changes to employer “workfromhome” policies reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products 

• we may not be successful in our marketing promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences we operate in a complex and costly marketing promotional and advertising environment our marketing promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising promotional and marketing resources across different channels including digital marketing allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them if the advertising promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales and market share could decrease 

finally customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations an inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

• failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties

• increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established 

the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather climate change water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain natural disasters crop disease and pests general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices for example drought conditions in brazil have and given continued drought conditions are predicted to continue to impact coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have a material adverse impact on our profitability similarly increases in the cost of or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in the processing of plantbased alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability

risks related to competition 

• we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such as delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ® stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors or competition from large new entrants or wellfunded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment in addition not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors we may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability additionally if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods or our competitors respond more effectively this could have a negative effect on our business furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products flattening demand for our products changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business 

risks related to operating a global business 

• we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our north america operating segment 

our financial performance is highly dependent on our north america operating segment which comprised approximately 70 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2021 if the north america operating segment revenue trends slow or decline or does not successfully recover in the post covid19 environment especially in our us market our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the north america segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

• we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets 

our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns along with our north america segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income china is currently our fastest growing market our second largest market overall and 100 companyowned due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risks in china including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following 

• the effects of current uschina relations including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations potential boycotts and increasing antiamericanism 

• escalating uschina tension and increasing political sensitivities in china 

• the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china 

• entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china 

• changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class wages labor inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs

• ongoing government regulatory reform including relating to public health food safety tariffs and tax sustainability and responses to climate change which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs and 

• foodsafety related matters including compliance with foodsafety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations 

• we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in 84 markets globally our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies 

• changes or uncertainties in economic legal regulatory social and political conditions in our markets as well as negative effects on us businesses due to increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets 

• interpretation and application of laws and regulations including tax tariffs labor merchandise antibribery and privacy laws and regulations 

• restrictive actions of foreign or us governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment especially during periods of heightened tension between the us and such foreign governmental authorities including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership 

• import or other business licensing requirements 

• the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new us and international regulations 

• in developing economies the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural differences as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets 

• local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employees 

• local regulations health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic affecting our operations and 

• delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and in turn negatively impact net revenues operating income and earnings per share 

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

risks related to governmental and regulatory changes 

• failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results 

our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare food and beverage sanitation safety environmental labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of noncompliance changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations including

in addition our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving us and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the gdpr and the ccpa discussed in more detail in this risk factors section and other applicable international and us privacy laws or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect and use data require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business 

the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended september 29 2019 included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” can be found in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended september 27 2020 the fiscal 2021 latin america and caribbean licensed store market resegmentation did not have a material impact to prior year north america and international operating segment business trends and operating margins 

overview 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 certain changes were made to our management team and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result we realigned our fully licensed latin america and caribbean markets from our americas operating segment to our international operating segment additionally we renamed the americas operating segment to the north america operating segment since it is comprised of our companyoperated and licensed stores in the us and canada we also made certain other immaterial changes between our international operating segment and corporate and other concurrent with the change in reportable segments we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation there was no impact on consolidated net revenues total operating expenses operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes 

we have three reportable operating segments 1 north america which is inclusive of the us and canada 2 international which is inclusive of china japan asia pacific europe middle east africa latin america and the caribbean and 3 channel development nonreportable operating segments such as evolution fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within corporate and other 

our financial results and longterm growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings comparable store sales and margin management we believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies throughout this mda we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics 

• new store openings and store count 

• comparable store sales 

• operating margin 

starbucks results for fiscal 2021 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand consolidated revenues increased 24 to 291 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 235 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to business recovery from the covid19 pandemic also contributing to the increase was 576 million of incremental revenue attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021 

for the north america segment comparable store sales increased 22 for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12 in fiscal 2020 comparable store sales for our us market increased 21 for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12 in fiscal 2020 the us market also had a 7 increase in twoyear comparable store sales 1  we lapped higher costs attributable to covid19 in the prior year including catastrophe pay programs for companyoperated store partners employees net of qualified tax credits provided by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” and the canada emergency wage subsidy “cews” in fiscal 2020 we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our north america store portfolio primarily in dense metropolitan markets by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences as of the fiscal year ended october 3 2021 we had substantially completed our restructuring plan which resulted in the closure of 807 stores in the us and canada costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts were recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings in october 2021 we announced plans to deliver retail wage increases across the us in fiscal 2022 this investment combined with industryleading benefits supports starbucks aspiration to remain an employer of choice that can attract and retain the highquality talent necessary to support our continued growth 

for the international segment comparable store sales increased by 16 for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 19 in fiscal 2020 comparable store sales for our china market increased 17 inclusive of a 3 adverse impact from lapping the prioryear valueadded tax “vat” benefit key markets in the international segment continued to experience pandemicrelated restrictions that significantly impacted customer mobility during the year although nearly all companyoperated stores in these markets remained open the modified operating protocols had an adverse impact to comparable store sales and operating results 

table of contents 

revenue for our channel development segment decreased 331 million or 17 when compared with fiscal 2020 this was largely due to the transition of certain singleserve product activities to nestlé beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 this was partially offset by growth in our readytodrink business we expect channel development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022 as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is the last quarter lapping these transition related activities 

during fiscal 2021 we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors while we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022 we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our longterm growth and profitability absent significant and prolonged covid19 relapses or global economic disruptions and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation we are confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of longterm “growth at scale” strategy to deliver consistent revenue and income growth we anticipate the planned wage investment in the us along with increased supply chain costs primarily related to inflationary pressures that began in the latter half of the fiscal year will have an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022 however these should be meaningfully offset by benefits from pricing decisions and leverage from revenue growth and productivity efficiency

financial highlights 

• total net revenues increased 24 to 291 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 235 billion in fiscal 2020 including 576 million attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021 

• consolidated operating income increased to 49 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 16 billion in fiscal 2020 fiscal 2021 operating margin was 168 compared to 66 in fiscal 2020 operating margin expansion was primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher covid19 related costs in the prior year mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners net of temporary subsidies from the us and certain foreign governments as well as pricing in north america in the current year these increases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits and to a lesser extent increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021 

• diluted earnings per share “eps” for fiscal 2021 increased to 354 compared to eps of 079 in fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily driven by lapping the adverse impacts of covid19 in prior year also contributing to the increase was a 056 gain net of estimated taxes on the divestiture of our south korea joint venture and 010 related to the extra week in fiscal 2021 

• capital expenditures were 15 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

• we returned 21 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2021 through dividends we returned 36 billion in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020 due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022

consolidated results of operations in millions  

revenues 

total net revenues increased 55 billion or 24 over fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher revenues from companyoperated stores 54 billion the growth in companyoperated store revenue was driven by a 20 increase in comparable store sales 38 billion attributable to a 9 increase in comparable transactions and a 10 increase in average ticket the incremental revenues from 524 net new starbucks ® companyoperated store openings or a 3 increase over the past 12 months 782 million the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 496 million and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation 359 million 

licensed stores revenue of 357 million also contributed to the increase in total net revenues driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 270 million the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 57 million and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation 28 million 

other revenues decreased 256 million primarily driven by the transition of certain singleserve product activities to nestlé partially offsetting this decrease was growth in our readytodrink business 43 million and the impact of the extra fiscal week in fiscal 2021 23 million 

operating expenses 

product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 260 basis points primarily due to sales leverage driven by lapping the severe impact of the covid19 pandemic in the prior year and pricing in north america in the current year these decreases were partially offset by increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021 

store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 470 basis points store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated store revenues decreased 770 basis points primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher covid19 related costs in the prior year mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners net of temporary subsidies from the us and certain foreign governments approximately 190 basis points and labor efficiencies approximately 110 basis points these decreases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits approximately 140 basis points 

table of contents 

other operating expenses decreased 71 million primarily due to lower global coffee alliance transaction costs inclusive of lapping integration costs for the global coffee alliance and a change of a related accrual estimate in fiscal 2021 

depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points primarily due to sales leverage 

general and administrative expenses increased 253 million primarily due to higher performancebased compensation recognizing the strength of the companys overall recovery from pandemicrelated business impacts 111 million incremental strategic investments in technology 89 million increased partner wages and benefits 26 million and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 22 million 

restructuring and impairment expenses decreased 108 million primarily due to lower asset impairment related to our north america store portfolio optimization 65 million lapping the intangible asset impairment from the prior year 22 million and lower severance costs 

income from equity investees increased 63 million primarily due to higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture 30 million and growth in our south korea joint venture prior to divestiture 22 million we expect lower income from equity method investments in the future as a result of the sale of our south korea joint venture see note 2  however we do not expect this transaction to have a material impact on future revenue and operating margin trends 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 1020 basis points in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 

other income and expenses 

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased 865 million due to the sale of our ownership interest in our south korea joint venture 

interest income and other net increased 50 million primarily due to additional income from certain investments and net favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our commodity price fluctuation risk 

interest expense increased 33 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on longterm debt issued in march 2020 and may 2020 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 216 compared to 206 for fiscal 2020 the increase was due to the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings approximately 380 basis points as well as higher pretax income in fiscal 2021 which resulted in lower rate benefits from several discrete items including stockbased compensation excess tax benefits approximately 380 basis points the release of income tax reserves upon expiration of statute of limitations approximately 150 basis points and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to an enacted foreign corporate rate change approximately 80 basis points these unfavorable drivers were partially offset by lapping valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions in the prior year approximately 990 basis points see note 14  income taxes for further discussion

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we replaced our 20 billion unsecured 5year revolving credit facility the “2018 credit facility” and our 10 billion unsecured 364day credit facility the “364day credit facility” with a new 30 billion unsecured 5year revolving credit facility the “2021 credit facility” 

our 2021 credit facility of which 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit is currently set to mature on september 16 2026 we have the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 10 billion borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor and for us dollardenominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate as defined in the credit facility in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on the company’s longterm credit ratings assigned by moody’s and standard  poor’s rating agencies the 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time libor ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform the “base rate” of interest is the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 0025 ii bank of america’s prime rate and iii the eurocurrency rate as defined in the credit facility plus 1025 the 2021 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes as of october 3 2021 we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility

see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the longterm notes were issued as of october 3 2021 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including but not limited to additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners repaying maturing debts as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “growth at scale” agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future however significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future in this regard we may incur additional debt within targeted levels as part of our plans to fund our capital programs including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases if necessary we may pursue additional sources of financing including both shortterm and longterm borrowings and debt issuances 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings in the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material we currently do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs see note 14  income taxes for further discussion 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we replaced our 20 billion 2018 credit facility and our 10 billion 364day credit facility with a new 30 billion 2021 credit facility the 2021 credit facility was not drawn on in fiscal 2021 and is currently set to mature on september 16 2026 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of 041 per share on september 30 2020 and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 we declared a cash dividend of 045 per share dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date cash returned to shareholders through dividends in 

table of contents 

fiscal 2021 and 2020 totaled 21 billion and 19 billion respectively during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we declared a cash dividend of 049 per share to be paid on november 26 2021 with an expected payout of approximately 5781 million 

in march 2019 we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements “asr agreements” with thirdparty financial institutions totaling 20 billion effective march 22 2019 we made a 20 billion upfront payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 222 million shares of our common stock in june 2019 we received an additional 39 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volumeweighted average share price less discount of 7650 

outside of the asr agreements noted above we repurchased 366 million shares of common stock for 31 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended september 29 2019 in total we repurchased 1396 million shares at a total cost of 101 billion for the fiscal year ended september 29 2019 

our board of directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020 respectively we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020 prior to the suspension we repurchased 203 million shares of common stock for 17 billion on the open market during the year ended september 27 2020 as of october 3 2021 489 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

other than operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2022 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores our supply chain and corporate facilities total capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately 2 billion 

the following table summarizes current and longterm material cash requirements as of october 3 2021 which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows  in millions

2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms green coffee purchase commitments comprise 96 of total purchase obligations 

3 other obligations include other longterm liabilities primarily consisting of longterm income taxes payable asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 60 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to 16 billion for fiscal 2020 the change was primarily due to higher net earnings and lapping the us federal tax payment related to the nestlé transaction in fiscal 2020 

cash used in investing activities totaled 03 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to 17 billion for fiscal 2020 the change was primarily driven by net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our south korea joint venture and higher maturities and calls of investments this was partially offset by a decrease in sales of investments and higher capital contributions to equity method investments 

cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 totaled 37 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of 17 billion for fiscal 2020 the change was primarily due to lower net proceeds from borrowing activities and higher debt repayments partially offset by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1  as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk which we consider to be low we use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances we also use crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in japan excluding interest rate hedging instruments cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs primarily coffee dairy products diesel cocoa sugar and other commodities that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 3 2021 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  

foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the chinese renminbi japanese yen canadian dollar british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items the volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the us dollar

equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october 3 2021 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of october 3 2021

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain especially in light of the current economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise we believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity for the reasons discussed below

we evaluate property plant and equipment operating lease rightofuse “rou” assets and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level which is inclusive of property plant and equipment and lease rou assets the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store the fair value of a store’s rou asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

in fiscal 2020 we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our north america store portfolio primarily in dense metropolitan markets by developing new store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences as of october 3 2021 807 stores in the us and canada were identified for closure and substantially all were closed under the plan during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we recorded approximately 1554 million and 2547 million respectively to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings these totals included 531 million and 1510 million respectively related to impairment and disposition of companyoperated store assets and 895 million and 877 million respectively primarily associated with accelerated amortization of rou lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms we expect total future restructuring costs under this plan which are attributable to our north america segment to be immaterial 

asset impairment charges are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based 

table of contents 

on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value and absent a sustained multiyear global decline in our business in key markets such as the us and china we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months our fiscal 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing which was completed in the third fiscal quarter resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed was in excess of carrying value of approximately 74 billion when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 14  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we do not expect a significant amount of the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2022 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities  

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material 

table of contents 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results including forecasted business performance could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

revenue components 

we generate the majority of our revenues through companyoperated stores and licensed stores 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 27 2020 



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 81 of total net revenues during fiscal 2020 our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience is built upon superior customer service convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets as well as increasing sales in existing stores to support our longterm strategic objective to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including expected financial returns the maturity of the market economic conditions consumer behavior and local business practices 

companyoperated store data for the yearended september 27 2020 



starbucks ® companyoperated stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and rural and offhighway locations we are continuing the expansion of our stores particularly drivethru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience and alternative store formats which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas 

prior to the novel coronavirus outbreak known as the global pandemic covid19 approximately 80 of starbucks transactions in us companyoperated stores were “onthego” occasions this has prompted us to reexamine our us store footprint and evolve our retail presence over time through targeted store renovations relocations and new stores we have since introduced a new store format starbucks ® pickup to enhance the “onthego” customer experience and improve operating efficiency across starbucks ® stores in certain major metropolitan areas in the americas new store formats such as starbucks pickup are suitable for customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the starbucks ® mobile app for pickup in our major international markets we continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience in china the introduction of starbucks now tm stores enables a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints orders may be placed in advance through the starbucks mobile app or starbucks delivers tm and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery riders in these express retail format locations these strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences including higher levels of mobile ordering more contactless pickup experiences and reduced instore congestion all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing we believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position starbucks for longterm growth

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10 of total net revenues in fiscal 2020 licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores in a limited number of international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores 

licensed store data for the yearended september 27 2020 



other revenues 

other revenues primarily are recorded in our channel development segment and include sales of packaged coffee tea and readytodrink beverages to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores as well as royalties received from nestlé under the global coffee alliance and other collaborative partnerships 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control substantially all coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee we also utilize forward contracts futures contracts and collars to hedge c price exposure under our pricetobefixed green coffee contracts and our longterm forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and pricetobefixed contracts are not yet available total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2022 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates nine farmer support centers including our china farmer support center located in the yunnan province of 

this highgrowth market all farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector and the readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to both wellestablished and startup companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo starbucks reserve seattle’s best coffee teavana and frappuccino are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income however the covid19 outbreak may have an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

as a company with global operations we are subject to the laws of the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies which may differ among jurisdictions compliance with these laws rules and regulation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods 

human capital management 

as a company starbucks mission is not only to deliver outstanding financial results by offering exceptional and unique products and services but to also create a strong connection with the communities where we operate we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose this is largely attributed to our partners employees who strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our customers therefore one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market including the following areas of focus 

oversight and management

we regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our retail and nonretail partners on a variety of topics including but not limited to confidence in company leadership competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our company an employer of choice the results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement our management and crossfunctional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention workplace safety harassment and bullying as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at 

any time and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

• our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus known as covid19 was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 to date this outbreak has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and as the pandemic continues to spread particularly in the united states businesses as well as federal state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis our operations have been and will continue to be disrupted to varying degrees in many markets from limited operations including only drivethru and delivery to full store closures in some markets while we cannot predict the duration or scope of the covid19 pandemic it has negatively impacted our business and such impact has been and is expected to continue to be material to our financial results condition and outlook 

the further spread of covid19 and the requirements to take action to mitigate the spread of the pandemic will impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even in regions where we have reopened stores our stores may be subject to modified hours and operations andor reduced customer traffic moreover certain of those regions including parts of china and the united states have suffered a covid19 relapse after reopening if those regions fail to fully contain covid19 or if additional regions suffer multiple covid19 relapses any of those markets may not recover quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory store and corporate assets— and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited— any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results on march 27 2020 the us government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” which among other things provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the covid19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period based on our evaluation of the cares act we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future additionally the canadian government enacted the canada emergency wage subsidy “cews” to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period we elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the us canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses there is no guarantee that we will continue to meet the eligibility requirements to participate in any current or future government relief programs or that the benefits will meaningfully offset the lost revenues and incremental costs incurred increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 and the efficacy scope and duration of actions to limit the spread of covid19 or treat its impact among others while such actions have been relaxed or rolled back in certain markets the actions have been reinstated in certain regions that have suffered relapse and may be reinstated in additional regions as the pandemic continues to evolve the scope and timing of any such reinstatements are difficult to predict and may materially affect our future operations 

• our financial condition and results of operations are subject to and may be adversely affected by a number of other factors many of which are also largely outside our control 

in addition to the covid19 pandemic our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

• increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets 

• adverse outcomes of litigation 

• severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets and 

• especially in our large markets labor discord or disruption geopolitical events including escalating uschina tensions war terrorism including incidents targeting us political instability acts of public violence boycotts increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores 

• economic conditions in the us and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors lowerpriced products as a result of various factors including job losses inflation higher taxes reduced access to credit changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes due to the covid19 pandemic we may experience a reduction andor increased volatility in demand for our products which may be caused by among other things store closures or modified operating hours and business model reduced customer traffic due to illness quarantine or government or selfimposed restrictions placed on our stores operations and changes in consumer spending behaviors eg continued practice of social distancing decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry 

• failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to net revenues operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales growth operating cash flows and shareholder returns will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

risks related to brand relevance and brand execution 

• our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results 

we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food product recalls store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases such as covid19 or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media including for malicious reasons or result in litigation consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we our employees licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products act or are perceived to act in an unethical illegal raciallybiased unequal or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes additionally if we fail to comply with laws and regulations publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or foster an inclusive and diverse environment our brand value may be diminished 

• if our business partners and thirdparty providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer 

our global business strategy including our plans for new stores branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly for our entire global channel development business licensees retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or companyoperated store so we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these licensees and other business partners however the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control we do not have direct control over our business partners including in their adherence to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the covid19 pandemic and may not have visibility into their practices 

we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results 

• incidents involving food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling whether or not accurate as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products could harm our business 

instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions andor temporary store closures clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages as well as ice for our cold beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error 

we also face risk by relying on thirdparty food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls potential food safety incidents whether at our stores or involving our business partners could lead to wide public exposure which could materially harm our business 

additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls viralcontaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

• we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

• being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience 

• building our leadership position around coffee 

• driving convenience brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile loyalty delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally 

• simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers 

• increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats including the accelerated development of alternative store formats such as starbucks ® pickup stores starbucks now stores and curbside pickup in light of the covid19 pandemic 

• adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the covid19 pandemic 

• moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more companyowned model in other markets 

• creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup 

• continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners 

• delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks ® retail stores and other channels and internationally and 

• reducing our operating costs particularly general and administrative expenses 

in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results include the following 

• imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees 

• construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally 

• governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores due to the covid19 pandemic 

• not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand including our emphasis on a broad range of highquality food offerings and 

• the deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives such as large acquisitions and integrations we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

• evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outsidethehome food and beverages such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick  mortar” retail stores lack of customer acceptance of new products including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs brands such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand and platforms such as features of our mobile technology changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced in addition some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations furthermore our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines changes to employer “work 

fromhome” policies reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

• the unauthorized access use theft or destruction of customer or employee personal financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues 

many of our information technology systems and those of our licensees and other thirdparty business partners whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers including those used for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms online and mobile payment systems delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems similar to other companies the number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations in our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to covid19 to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of customers or employees data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations additionally the california privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which was enacted in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1 2020 provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

compliance with the gdpr the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and timeconsuming significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breach information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

• we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business delivery services mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality additionally the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth including our ability to increase digital 

relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend is highly dependent on our technology systems furthermore due to social distancing measures put in place as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenienceled formats which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support additionally our systems hardware software and services provided by thirdparty service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our thirdparty business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

risks related to labor and supply chain 

• our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations 

the growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into maintain develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of and enforce commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators with few exceptions if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements andor fails to support protect and grow our brand in channel development our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time present longterm challenges to our brand limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results additionally the growth of our channel development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses 

there are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets our business partners may be materially adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and may not have sufficient financial support and capital to remain financially solvent and may not have the ability to meet their development goals and targets 

due to the covid19 pandemic our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers through the effects of business and facilities closures reductions in operating hours social economic political or labor instability in affected areas transportation delays travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures including for additional cleaning and safety protocols 

• increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of highquality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established 

the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather including the potential effects of climate change natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of 

coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

• interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability 

any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our thirdparty logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions pandemics social or labor unrest natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability 

• changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs including wages and benefits which in a retail business such as ours are two of our most significant costs both domestically and internationally including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages scheduling and benefits increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages benefits and costs related to the covid19 pandemic the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently highquality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations furthermore due to the covid19 pandemic we could experience a shortage of labor for store positions as concern over exposure to covid19 and other factors could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions in addition our wages and benefits programs combined with the challenging conditions due to the covid19 pandemic may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent 

• the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior instore experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large hightech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits additionally there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives including increasing our digital relationships with customers if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

risks related to competition 

• we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such as delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ® stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors or competition from large new entrants or wellfunded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products flattening demand for our products changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business 

risks related to operating a global business 

• we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment 

our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 70 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2020 if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline or does not successfully recover in the post covid19 environment especially in our us market our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

• we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets 

our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns along with our americas segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income china is currently our fastest growing market our second largest market overall and 100 companyowned due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risks in china including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following 

• the effects of current uschina relations including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations potential boycotts and increasing antiamericanism 

• escalating uschina tension and increasing political sensitivities in china 

• the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china 

• entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china 

• changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class wages labor inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs 

• ongoing government regulatory reform including relating to public health food safety tariffs and tax sustainability bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations which may be contrary to ours as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs and 

• foodsafety related matters including compliance with foodsafety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations 

• we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we operate in over 80 markets globally our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies 

• changes or uncertainties in economic legal regulatory social and political conditions in our markets as well as negative effects on us businesses due to increasing antiamerican sentiment in certain markets 

• interpretation and application of laws and regulations including tax tariffs labor merchandise antibribery and privacy laws and regulations 

• uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdoms referendum to withdraw membership from the european union referred to as “brexit” including financial legal tax and trade implications 

• restrictive actions of foreign or us governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment especially during periods of heightened tension between the us and such foreign governmental authorities including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership 

• import or other business licensing requirements 

• the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new us and international regulations 

• in developing economies the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural differences as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets 

• local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employees 

• local regulations health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid19 pandemic affecting our store operations and 

• delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and in turn negatively impact net revenues operating income and earnings per share 

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

risks related to governmental and regulatory changes 

• failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results 

our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare food and beverage sanitation safety environmental labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws changes in applicable environmental regulations including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners which could affect our profitability furthermore due to the covid19 

pandemic we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines as well as any other voluntary safety protocols 

in addition our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving us and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the gdpr and the ccpa discussed in more detail in this risk factors section and other applicable international and us privacy laws or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect and use data require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition the european commission in july 2016 and the swiss government in january 2017 approved the euus and the swissus privacy shield frameworks respectively which are designed to allow us companies that selfcertify to the us department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with the privacy shield requirements to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland however these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both europe and the us the euus privacy shield framework approved by the european commission which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the european economic area could be invalidated by the court of justice of the european union the potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area 

the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30 all references to store counts including data for new store openings are reported net of related store closures unless otherwise noted 

overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2020 reflect the challenges our business faced with the covid19 pandemic which severely impacted our results particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters consolidated revenues declined 11 to 235 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 265 billion in fiscal 2019 driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our companyoperated and licensed stores as well as modified business operations and reduced customer traffic we gradually reopened our stores and since then have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our americas and international segments as transaction volumes continue to climb reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand 

comparable store sales for the americas segment declined by 12 for fiscal 2020 primarily due to the temporary store closures reduced customer traffic and shortened store hours the most negative impacts occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 most companyoperated and licensed stores were reopened as of early may and over 60 of companyoperated stores in the us provided limited seating by the end of the fiscal year to help protect the health and welfare of our partners we incurred incremental labor costs including paying the wages and benefits to partners who were either unable or uncomfortable working from midmarch through may a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners resulting from reduced store hours the incremental wages incurred were partially offset by qualified tax credits provided by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” and the canada emergency wage subsidy “cews” in june 2020 we announced a plan to optimize our north america store portfolio primarily in dense metropolitan markets by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we closed approximately 100 stores in the us and canada and we expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months this reflects an additional 200 store closures than the initial announcement estimate of 600 stores costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts are recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings and will continue to be recorded in accordance with the anticipated timeline of store closures 

for the international segment comparable store sales declined by 19 for fiscal 2020 mostly due to the 31 and 37 reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020 respectively companyoperated stores in the china market began reopening in the fiscal second quarter and nearly all companyoperated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts we extended more flexible development and financial terms including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter 

revenue for our channel development segment declined 68 million or 3 when compared with fiscal 2019 this is largely due to the lapping of global coffee alliance transitionrelated activities including higher inventory sales in the prior year as nestlé prepared to fulfill customer orders these are partially offset by the continued growth of the global coffee alliance during fiscal 2020 

throughout the second half of fiscal 2020 we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations as of september 27 2020 nearly all of our companyoperated and licensed stores were reopened those that have remained closed are located in travel or transportation hubs as well as central business districts our global business is recovering steadily with china approaching comparable store sales recovery and the us demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability our channel development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their athome routines in fiscal 2021 we expect lower revenues for the segment as we transitioned our singleserve coffee business to a more royaltybased model we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our earnings however the change is anticipated to have an accretive impact on operating margin for the segment 

we continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive longterm growth by reimagining our store formats we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors absent significant covid19 relapses or global economic disruptions and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences digital capabilities and beverage innovation we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic 

financial highlights 

• total net revenues decreased 11 to 235 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 265 billion in fiscal 2019 

• consolidated operating income decreased to 16 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to operating income of 41 billion in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 operating margin was 66 compared to 154 in fiscal 2019 operating margin contraction was primarily driven by sales deleverage and additional costs incurred attributable to covid19 including catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners net of benefits provided by government subsidies higher restructuring activities related to our americas store portfolio optimization and investments to support key business partners also contributed these decreases were partially offset by sales leverage realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to the onset of covid19 impacts and supply chain efficiencies 

• earnings per share “eps” for fiscal 2020 decreased to 079 compared to eps of 292 in fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by the adverse impacts of covid19 including lower revenues due to temporary store closures reduced customer traffic and modified operations as well as incremental labor expenses and restructuring costs 

• capital expenditures were 15 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 18 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a pause in new store openings due to covid19 

• we returned 36 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends compared to 120 billion in fiscal 2019 we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020

income from equity investees decreased 3 million primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china this decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in south korea and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 

other income and expenses 



gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50 ownership interest in our east china joint venture to fair value upon acquisition 

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our thailand france and the netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019 the gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018 

interest income and other net decreased 95 million primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue we recorded stored value card breakage in interest income and other net in the prior year 

interest expense increased 161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on longterm debt issued in november 2017 march 2018 august 2018 and may 2019 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 195 compared to 218 for fiscal 2018 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the tax act approximately 350 basis points lapping prior years transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities approximately 300 basis points higher stockbased compensation excess tax benefit approximately 140 basis points the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a us tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations approximately 130 basis points and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our thailand retail operations approximately 130 basis points these favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior years gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax approximately 580 basis points and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 approximately 170 basis points see note 14  income taxes for further discussion

our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the senior notes were issued as of september 27 2020 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including but not limited to additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses including 

investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners repaying maturing debts as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “growth at scale” agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future in this regard we may incur additional debt within targeted levels as part of our plans to fund our capital programs including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases to further strengthen our liquidity in the near term we currently expect the suspension of share repurchases to continue through the end of fiscal 2021 if necessary we may pursue additional sources of financing including both shortterm and longterm borrowings and debt issuances 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs see note 14  income taxes for further discussion 

during fiscal 2020 we entered into a new 500 million unsecured 364day termloan facility “the 2020 termloan facility” which we drew on and subsequently repaid within the fiscal year the 2020 termloan facility was originally set to mature on march 19 2021 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of 036 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 we declared a cash dividend of 041 per share dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled 19 billion and 18 billion respectively subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we declared a cash dividend of 045 per share to be paid on november 27 2020 with an expected payout of approximately 5279 million as of the date of this report we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

in september 2018 we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements “asr agreements” with thirdparty financial institutions totaling 50 billion effective october 1 2018 we made a 50 billion upfront payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 720 million shares of our common stock in march 2019 we received an additional 49 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volumeweighted average share price less discount of 6503 

additionally in march 2019 we entered into asr agreements with thirdparty financial institutions totaling 20 billion effective march 22 2019 we made a 20 billion upfront payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 222 million shares of our common stock in june 2019 we received an additional 39 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volumeweighted average share price less discount of 7650 

outside of the asr agreements noted above we repurchased 366 million shares of common stock for 31 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended september 29 2019 in total we repurchased 1396 million shares at a total cost of 101 billion for the fiscal year ended september 29 2019 

our board of directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020 respectively we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020 prior to the suspension we repurchased 203 million shares of common stock for 17 billion on the open market during the year ended september 27 2020 as of september 27 2020 489 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations the existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the board of directors the suspension of the share repurchases is currently expected to continue through fiscal 2021 and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending upon operating results our capital needs and other factors 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2021 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately 19 billion 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 50 billion for fiscal 2019 the change was primarily due to temporary retail store closures resulting from the covid19 pandemic the us federal tax payment related to the nestlé transaction and the timing of other tax payments and refunds 

cash used in investing activities totaled 17 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 10 billion for fiscal 2019 the change was primarily driven by lapping proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations related to the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during 2019 and an increase in purchase of investments in fiscal 2020 this was partially offset by lower capital expenditures for new and existing stores 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 totaled 17 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of 101 billion for fiscal 2019 the change was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019 and higher proceeds from issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2020 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 27 2020 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions

starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1  as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate 

risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk which we consider to be low we use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances and crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in japan excluding interest rate hedging instruments cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs primarily coffee dairy products diesel cocoa sugar and other commodities that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27 2020 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the chinese renminbi japanese yen canadian dollar british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items the volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the us dollar see note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27 2020 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 27 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of september 27 2020 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 27 2020 on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



1 amount disclosed is net of 23 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap refer to note 3  derivative financial instruments for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge 

availableforsale debt securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 27 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain especially in light of the current economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment operating lease rightofuse “rou” assets and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level which is inclusive of property plant and equipment and lease rou assets the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

in each of the three fiscal years prior to fiscal 2020 our business has operated at levels of growth and profitability that have not required material numbers of our store assets to be reviewed for potential impairment given the substantial reduction in our revenues and cash flows as a result of the covid19 pandemic primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 along with our announced restructuring plans to close up to 800 of our companyoperated stores in the us and canada in the next 18 months we identified triggering events that required us to assess the need for potential impairment charges for a larger number of companyoperated stores in fiscal 2020 than in prior years as a result of these activities we recorded store impairment charges of 2989 million in fiscal 2020 of which 2393 million was included in restructuring and impairment expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings the magnitude of these charges was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value inputs as the majority of charges recorded were the result of full impairments of stores identified for closure based on factors such as the format and location of the store or its current operating performance excluding stores in areas impacted by our restructuring plans our companyoperated store portfolio is projecting a return to precovid19 levels of operations and cash flow recoverability within the next 12 months however irrespective of the above our expectations of business recovery trends may vary materially in future periods based on the pace of global and marketspecific recovery from the covid19 pandemic 

as of september 27 2020 we had identified 405 stores in the us and canada for closure under our restructuring plans we expect to potentially identify up to another 395 stores for closure we expect total future restructuring costs which are attributable to our americas segment to range from approximately 260 million to 400 million these restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of rou assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms 150 million to 190 million store asset impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process 100 million to 190 million and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs our estimates of future restructuring costs are based on actual costs incurred for recently closed stores of similar profile under the restructuring plans as we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans and because store closure decisions are still subject to change the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates these costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term for each store identified future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or in the case of lease exit costs when the stores cease operations 

asset impairment charges are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair 

value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value and absent a sustained multiyear global decline in our business in key markets such as the us and china we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months 

when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid19 and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion during fiscal 2020 we recorded a charge of 221 million relating to the impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset due to changes in branding and marketing strategy the amount of charge taken was not materially impacted by our choice of fair value assumptions and we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months 

definitelived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in note 8  other intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss during fiscal 2020 we recorded valuation allowances of 565 million to reduce our deferred tax asset balance as of the beginning of the fiscal year relating to certain foreign jurisdictions not expected to generate enough future income to offset accumulated losses absent a sustained multiyear global decline in our business in key markets such as the us china and japan we do not anticipate incurring significant additional valuation allowances against our remaining deferred tax assets as of september 27 2020 in the next 12 months 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is 

more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 1 4  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations andor resolution of examinations with taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings these plans have been unaltered as a result of the covid19 pandemic while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results including forecasted covid19 business recovery could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

segment financial information 

segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decisionmaking purposes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we realigned starbucks operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts specifically our previous chinaasia pacific cap segment and europe middle east and africa emea segment have been combined into one international segment concurrently results of siren retail a nonreportable operating segment consisting of starbucks reserve tm roastery  tasting rooms certain stores under the starbucks reserve brand and princi operations which were previously included within corporate and other are now reported within the americas and international segments based on the geographical location of the operations

our americas and international segments include both companyoperated and licensed stores our americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale certain markets within our international operations are either in various stages of development or undergoing transformations of their business models therefore they may require a more extensive support organization relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income than our americas operations

revenue components 

we generate the majority of our revenues through companyoperated stores and licensed stores 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 29 2019 



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 81 of total net revenues during fiscal 2019  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets as well as increasing sales in existing stores to support our longterm strategic objective to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including expected financial returns the maturity of the market economic conditions consumer behavior and local business practices 

companyoperated store data for the yearended september 29 2019  





starbucks ® companyoperated stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and in select rural and offhighway locations we are continuing the expansion of our stores particularly drive thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience and alternative store formats which are focused on an elevated starbucks experience for our customers 

retail sales mix by product type for companyoperated stores 



 stored value cards and loyalty program 

the starbucks card our branded stored value card program is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders in part through the related starbucks ® rewards loyalty program where available as discussed below stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance they can be obtained in our companyoperated and most licensed stores in north america china japan and many of our markets in our international segment stored value cards can also be obtained online via the starbucks ® mobile app and through other us and international retailers customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the starbucks ® mobile app in participating stores using the mobile order and pay functionality of the starbucks ® mobile app customers can also place orders in advance for pickup at certain participating locations in several markets in nearly all markets including the us and canada customers who register their starbucks cards are automatically enrolled in the starbucks rewards program registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points “stars” earned refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program 

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11 of total net revenues in fiscal 2019  licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores in a limited number of international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores 

licensed store data for the yearended september 29 2019  



 other revenues 

other revenues primarily are recorded in our channel development segment and include sales of packaged coffee tea and readytodrink beverages to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores historically revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee tea and readytodrink products to grocery warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies with the establishment of the global coffee alliance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 other revenues include product sales to and licensing revenue from nestlé under this arrangement and the amortization of the upfront prepaid royalty see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  deferred revenues for further information our collaborative relationships with pepsico inc anheuserbusch inbev tingyi holding corp arla foods and others for our global readytodrink beverages businesses in this segment are excluded from the global coffee alliance 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control substantially all coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in 

addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee we also utilize forward contracts futures contracts and collars to hedge c price exposure under our pricetobefixed green coffee contracts and our longterm forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and pricetobefixed contracts are not yet available total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2020  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates nine farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector and the readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to both wellestablished and startup companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo starbucks reserve seattle’s best coffee teavana frappuccino and starbucks via are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” “starbucksreservecom” “seattlesbestcom” and “teavanacom” 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 346000 people worldwide as of september 29 2019  in the us starbucks employed approximately 218000 people with approximately 209000 in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development roasting manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations approximately 128000 employees were employed outside of the us with approximately 124000 in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors lowerpriced products as a result of various factors including job losses inflation higher taxes reduced access to credit changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food product recalls store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media including for malicious reasons or result in litigation consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we our employees licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products act or are perceived to act in an unethical illegal raciallybiased unequal or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes additionally if we fail to comply with laws and regulations publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well our brand value may be diminished 

 our global business strategy including our plans for new stores branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly for our entire global channel development business licensees retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or companyoperated store so we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these licensees and other business partners however the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control 

we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions andor temporary store closures clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages as well as ice for our cold beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error 

we also face risk by relying on thirdparty food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products 

additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls or food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 many of our information technology systems and those of our licensees and other thirdparty business partners whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers including those used for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms online and mobile payment systems delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of customers or employees data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example 

the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations additionally the california privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which was enacted in june 2018 and will come into effect on january 1 2020 provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

compliance with the gdpr the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and timeconsuming significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breach information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business delivery services mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality additionally the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend is highly dependent on our technology systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support additionally our systems hardware software and services provided by thirdparty service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our thirdparty business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 



 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results include the following 

 effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives such as large acquisitions and integrations we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

 our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outsidethehome food and beverages such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to brick  mortar retail stores lack of customer acceptance of new products including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs brands such as the global expansion of the teavana brand in our starbucks ® retail stores and other channels and platforms such as features of our mobile technology changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced in addition some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 the growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into maintain develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of and enforce commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the 

speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators with few exceptions if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements andor fails to support protect and grow our brand in channel development our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time present longterm challenges to our brand limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results additionally the growth of our channel development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses 

there are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets 

 increases in labor costs including wages and benefits which in a retail business such as ours are two of our most significant costs both domestically and internationally including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages scheduling and benefits increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets furthermore the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently highquality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such as delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ® stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors or competition from large new entrants or wellfunded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 69 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2019  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline especially in our us market our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns along with our americas segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income china is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall with our acquisition of the east china business the china market is 100 companyowned due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risks in china including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following 

 additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations 

 we operate in over 80 markets globally our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established 

the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather including the potential effects of climate change natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and 

prepared food offerings especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales growth operating cash flows shareholder returns and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior instore experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large hightech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits additionally there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives including increasing our digital relationships with customers if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare food and beverage sanitation safety environmental labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws changes in applicable environmental regulations including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners which could affect our profitability 

in addition our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving us and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the gdpr and the ccpa discussed in more detail in this risk factors section and other applicable international and us privacy laws or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect and use data require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition the european commission in july 2016 and the swiss government in january 2017 approved the euus and the swissus privacy shield frameworks respectively which are designed to allow us companies that selfcertify to the us department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with the privacy shield requirements to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland however these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both europe and the us the euus privacy shield framework approved by the european commission which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the european economic area could be invalidated by the court of justice of the european union the potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area 

the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to focus on accelerating growth in highreturning businesses and converting several market operations including thailand france and the netherlands to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019 additionally in fiscal 2019 we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts specifically our previous chinaasia pacific cap segment and europe middle east and africa emea segment have been combined into one international segment results of siren retail a nonreportable operating segment consisting of starbucks reserve tm roastery  tasting rooms certain stores under the starbucks reserve brand and princi operations which were previously included within corporate and other are now reported within the americas and international segments based on the geographical location of the operations as a result we have three reportable operating segments americas international and channel development nonreportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within corporate and other 

further to better support the review of our results we have changed the classification of certain costs the most significant change was the reclassification of companyowned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses we also made certain other immaterial changes 

concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation there was no impact on consolidated net revenues total operating expenses operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law hr 1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed existing us tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business our us corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21 while a blended rate of 245 was applied in fiscal 2018

total net revenues increased 18 billion  or 7  over fiscal 2018  primarily driven by higher revenues from companyoperated stores  19 billion  the growth in companyoperated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new starbucks ® companyoperated store openings over the past 12 months 957 million and a 5 increase in comparable store sales 879 million attributable to a 3 increase in average ticket and a 2 increase in comparable transactions these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 189 million and the conversion of our thailand france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 161 million 

licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues  223 million  primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 228 million largely due to the opening of 992 net new starbucks ® licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversion of our thailand france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets 35 million partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 41 million

other operating expenses decreased 184 million primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé 176 million and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance 34 million including business taxes associated with the upfront prepaid royalty from nestlé and headcountrelated costs primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs 

depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china approximately 20 basis points 

general and administrative expenses increased 116 million primarily driven by higher performancebased compensation 89 million and the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter 52 million

income from equity investees decreased 3 million primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china this decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in south korea and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018  

other income and expenses

interest expense increased 161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on longterm debt issued in november 2017 march 2018 august 2018 and may 2019 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 195 compared to 218 for fiscal 2018  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the tax act approximately 350 basis points lapping prior years transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities approximately 300 basis points higher stockbased compensation excess tax benefit approximately 140 basis points the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a us tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations approximately 130 basis points and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our thailand retail operations approximately 130 basis points these favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior years gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax approximately 580 basis points and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 approximately 170 basis points see note 13  income taxes for further discussion

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including but not limited to additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to invest in our core businesses including capital expenditures new product innovations related marketing support and partner and digital investments return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future in this regard we may incur additional debt within targeted levels as part of our plans to fund our capital programs including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional 

foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material we have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries this change did not have a material impact to our financial results we have not nor do we anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs see note 13  income taxes for further discussion 

during each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018  we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of 030 per share in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019  we declared a cash dividend of 036 per share dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2019 and 2018 totaled 18 billion and 17 billion  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  we declared a cash dividend of 041 per share to be paid on november 29 2019 with an expected payout of approximately 486 million

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2020 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately 18 billion  

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 50 billion for fiscal 2019  compared to 119 billion for fiscal 2018  the change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year receipt of the upfront payment from nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

cash used by investing activities totaled 10 billion for fiscal 2019  compared to 24 billion for fiscal 2018  the change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment to acquire the 50 ownership interest in our east china joint venture and higher proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations 

cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 totaled 101 billion  compared to 32 billion for fiscal 2018  the change was primarily due to lower proceeds from issuance of longterm debt and higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the chinese renminbi japanese yen canadian dollar british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items see note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 29 2019 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 29 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of september 29 2019  

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 29 2019 on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



 availableforsale debt securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 29 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an 

appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2019  there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

the goodwill impairment charges are discussed in note 8  other intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates 

we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 13  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations andor resolution of examinations with taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes we have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years’ cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes which could be material 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

revenue components 

we generate the majority of our revenues through companyoperated stores and licensed stores 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 30 2018   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 80  of total net revenues during fiscal 2018  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience  is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11  of total net revenues in fiscal 2018  licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in our share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores in a limited number of international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

other revenues 

other revenues primarily are recorded in our channel development segment and include sales of packaged coffee tea and readytodrink beverages to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores historically revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee tea and readytodrink products to grocery warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies which serviced businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we began licensing the rights to sell and market starbucksbranded products in authorized channels to nestlé as a result other revenues includes product sales to and licensing revenue from nestlé under this arrangement and the amortization of the upfront prepaid royalty payment our collaborative business relationships for global readytodrink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance with nestlé 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for most contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date for other contracts starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “c” coffee commodity price until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of september 30 2018  were 11 billion  comprised of 996 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 166 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of september 30 2018  none of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts most pricetobefixed contracts as of september 30 2018  were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2019  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates nine  farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops offering premium and artisanal products and experiences in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates inflation higher taxes reduced access to credit economic uncertainty and potential negative impacts relating to federal economic policy changes and recent international trade disputes these factors may also result in a general downturn in the restaurant industry decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value 

of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships particularly in our international markets and thirdparty manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly for our entire global channel development business licensees retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures they may face we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensedstore operators as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store or a licensed store we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food product recalls store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media including for malicious reasons or result in litigation and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents or being perceived to not have reacted appropriately can significantly reduce brand value trigger boycotts of our stores or products or demonstrations at our stores result in civil and criminal liability and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we our employees or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products act or are perceived to act in an unethical illegal raciallybiased or unequal treatment basis or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products service and treatment at starbucks stores or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes fail to comply with laws and regulations publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages as well as ice for our cold beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration including produce such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices dairy products such as milk and cheeses nondairy alternative products such as soymilk and almondmilk ice for our cold drinks and meats we also face risk by relying on thirdparty food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control which make it more difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers if customers become ill from food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues we could be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities as well as recall products in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary 

closure of any of our stores product recalls or food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 many of our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems delivery services and rewards programs and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications as well as the information technology systems of our licensees franchisees and other thirdparty business partners and service providers whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of customers or employees data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incidents such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

compliance with the gdpr and other applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and timeconsuming significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business delivery services mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality additionally the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth including our priority to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend is highly dependent on our technology systems our ability to effectively manage our business launch digital and other initiatives and coordinate the production distribution administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support additionally our systems hardware software and services provided by thirdparty service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our thirdparty business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results include the following 



benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets whether due to changing industry practices competition or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations 

 our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators with few exceptions if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements andor fails to support protect and grow our brand in channel development our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time present longterm challenges to our brand limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products and in some markets there are only a few retailers if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient levels of support for our products which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business 

also a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses including their licensed stores it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model implement our arrangement with nestlé for most of our global channel development business and grow our teavana brand in our starbucks ® retail stores and other channels as well as expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently highquality product and customer 

experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives such as large acquisitions and integrations we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such as delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors or competition from large new entrants or wellfunded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 68  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2018  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline especially in our us and canada markets our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

the cap segment is now one of our two significant profit centers driving our global returns along with our americas segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenues and earnings china is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall with our recent acquisition of the east china business the china market is now 100 company owned and along with the us market due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risks in china including the risks mentioned elsewhere below and the following 

 additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with 

countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather including the potential effects of climate change natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have a material 

adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest and as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows shareholder returns and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance

financial highlights 



overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to focus on accelerating growth in highreturning businesses and removing noncore slow growth activities these efforts primarily include the acquisition of our east china joint venture the conversion of our singapore taiwan and brazil operations to licensed models the closure of teavana tmmc retail stores the sale of the tazo brand the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the closure of certain companyoperated stores in the us and canada among other actions these streamlining efforts span across all segments and our corporate functions 

on august 26 2018 our channel development segment finalized licensing and distribution agreements with nestlé to sell and market our cpg and foodservice products the scope of the arrangement converts the majority of our previously defined channel development segment operations as well as certain smaller businesses previously reported in the americas emea and corporate and other previously all other segment from companyowned to licensed operations with nestlé as a result we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established global coffee alliance our reportable segments have been restated as if those smaller businesses were previously within our channel development segment 

concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure further in an effort to report operating expenses in line with the corresponding revenue generating activities we have changed the classification of certain costs primarily within our cap segment and mainly from other operating expenses to general and administrative expenses this reclassification has been retrospectively applied and was determined to be immaterial 

starbucks largest acquisition to date affects our cap segment as a result of acquiring the remaining interest in our east china joint venture at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we began recording 100 of its revenues and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 this is in contrast with our previous joint venture model where we recorded only revenues and expenses from products sales to and royalties received from east china as well as our proportionate share of the joint ventures net profit the change from equity method to consolidation 

method lowered the operating margin of our consolidated and cap segment primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower income from equity investees 

starbucks results for fiscal 2018  continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners consolidated total net revenues increased 10 to 247 billion primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1997 net new store openings over the past 12 months incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in east china 2 growth in global comparable store sales and favorable foreign currency translation these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the closure of our teavana tmmc  retail stores initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and substantially ceased during fiscal 2018 and the sale of our singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 consolidated operating income declined 251 million or 6 to 39 billion operating margin declined 280 basis points to 157 primarily due to food and beveragerelated mix shifts largely in the americas segment the impact of our ownership change in east china higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms technology infrastructure and innovations earnings per share of 324 increased 64 over the prior year earnings per share of 197 

americas revenue grew by 7 to 167 billion primarily driven by incremental revenues from 895 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 2 partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the conversion of our brazil retail business to fully licensed operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 operating income declined 39 million to 36 billion and operating margin of 216 declined 180 basis points from a year ago primarily due to food and beveragerelated mix shifts increased investments in our store partners and the impact of the may 29th antibias training these increases were partially offset by sales leverage 

in our cap segment revenue grew by 38 to 45 billion primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in east china at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 incremental revenues from 756 net new stores over the past 12 months these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income grew 13 to 867 million while operating margin declined 420 basis points to 194 primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china we now operate 8530 stores in 15 markets in our cap segment making this our second largest reportable segment 

in our emea segment revenue grew by 9 to 10 billion primarily driven by increased revenues from the opening of 356 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and favorable foreign currency translation operating margin declined 400 basis points to 59 primarily due to higher impairment of goodwill related to our switzerland retail business and restructuring costs including severance asset impairments and business process optimization expenses these decreases were partially offset by lapping of a prior year tax settlement 

channel development segment revenues grew by 2 to 23 billion primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee and premium singleserve products lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment and favorable foreign currency translation these increases were partially offset by the net impact from the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé beginning on august 26 2018 operating income declined 40 million or 4 to 927 million operating margin declined 250 basis points to 404 primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from nestlé global coffee alliance headcount related costs including employee bonus and retention costs and the impact of our ownership changes including licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of our tazo brand 

fiscal 2019  — the view ahead 

turning to fiscal 2019  we expect continued growth through thoughtful longterm investments that create value and reward shareholders these results are expected to be driven by our three strategic priorities which include 

 to successfully achieve these priorities we will undertake a number of initiatives including growing our core business in the us through enhancement of the instore experience delivery of customerrelevant beverage innovation and digital relationships and growing our business in china through new store expansion comparable store sales and business partnerships further we will continue expanding the reach of the starbucks brand through retail market realignment including our plans to license the france netherlands belgium and luxembourg markets business simplification and the global coffee alliance these additional streamlining initiatives will enable us to amplify our focus and resources on core value drivers with the greatest prospect for returns 

we expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal 2019 reflecting implementation of our streamlining activities and driven by comparable store sales growth and the opening of approximately 2100 net new stores globally 

consolidated operating margin is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 and our effective tax rate is expected to increase slightly from fiscal 2018 while gaap fullyear diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease in fiscal 2019 fullyear nongaap diluted earnings per share is expected to grow when excluding gains from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2018 integration costs related to east china and japan and restructuring and impairment expenses 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2019  are expected to be approximately 20 billion primarily related to our retail portfolio including investments in our new and existing stores and strategic storerelated initiatives

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 50 basis points primarily due to continued focus and investment in product quality and innovation approximately 20 basis points and higher salaries and benefits approximately 20 basis points 

income from equity investees increased 47 million driven by higher income from our joint venture operations primarily in east china and south korea favorability in both regions was attributable to comparable store sales growth and the addition of net new licensed stores over the past 12 months east china also benefited from the new value added tax structure 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 

emea 

revenues 

emea total net revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 113 million or 11 over fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a decline in companyoperated store revenues 181 million driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region 121 million which includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 also contributing to the decline was unfavorable foreign currency translation 43 million and the absence of the 53rd week 11 million 

licensed store revenues increased 68 million driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 95 million resulting from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 14 companyoperated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 24 million and the absence of the 53rd week 6 million 

operating expenses 

cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 260 basis points primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency transactions approximately 150 basis points and the shift in the composition of our store portfolio to more licensed stores which have a lower gross margin approximately 100 basis points 

store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 200 basis points as a percentage of companyoperated store revenues store operating expenses increased 330 basis points primarily due to sales deleverage in certain companyoperated stores approximately 320 basis points and the impact of a tax settlement approximately 100 basis points partially offset by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores approximately 140 basis points

depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points primarily due to the shift in portfolio towards more licensed stores approximately 50 basis points 

restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2017 relate to a partial goodwill impairment expense recorded in our switzerland companyoperated retail reporting unit which we fully acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the overall economic backdrop in europe coupled with the strengthening of the swiss franc when compared to the relatively inexpensive euro in surrounding countries caused ongoing unfavorable changes in consumer behavior and depressed tourism our latest mitigation efforts for our switzerland retail business are not expected to fully recover the reporting units carrying value given 

the sustained nature of these and other external factors as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 18 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 230 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 

channel development 

discussion of our channel development segment results reflects the impact of an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 while this adjustment was immaterial the discussion below quantifies the impact to provide a better understanding of our results for fiscal 2017 

revenues 

channel development total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 62 million or 3 over fiscal 2016 revenue growth was driven by increased sales of packaged coffee tea and premium singleserve products 73 million our readytodrink beverages 21 million and higher foodservice sales 26 million higher foodservice sales were primarily the result of a change to a direct distribution model and recognizing the benefit of full revenue from premium singleserve product sales increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week 45 million and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods 13 million 

operating expenses 

cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points primarily driven by lower coffee costs approximately 80 basis points and leverage on cost of sales approximately 60 basis points partially offset by a shift toward lower margin products approximately 80 basis points and the revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods approximately 30 basis points 

other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points primarily driven by lower performancebased compensation approximately 40 basis points 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points primarily driven by lower performancebased compensation approximately 20 basis points and salaries and benefits approximately 10 basis points 

income from equity investees increased 28 million for fiscal 2017 due to higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture driven by increased sales of frappuccino® and starbucks doubleshot® beverages as well as new product launches over the past 12 months 

the combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 290 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes the results of our teavana siren retail evolution fresh and our unallocated corporate expenses unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 

the increase in the operating loss in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges related to our strategy to close teavana tmmc  retail stores and focus on teavana tmmc  tea within starbucks ®  stores we recorded 69 million for the partial impairment of goodwill and 60 million in restructuringrelated costs including asset impairments costs associated with the early closure of stores and their related obligations and severance

in august 2018  we issued longterm debt in an underwritten registered public offering which consisted of 125 billion  of 7 year 3800  senior notes the “2025 notes” due august 2025  750 million  of 10 year 4000  senior notes the “2028 notes” due november 2028  and 1 billion  of 30 year 4500  senior notes the “2048 notes” due november 2048  interest on the 2025 notes is payable semiannually on february 15 and august 15 commencing on february 15 2019 interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semiannually on may 15 and november 15 commencing on november 15 2018

see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 30 2018  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including but not limited to additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to invest in our core businesses including capital expenditures new product innovations related marketing support and partner and digital investments return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future in this regard we may incur additional debt within targeted levels as part of our plans to fund our capital programs including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

we have historically considered the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we continue to 

evaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus have not adjusted our previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the tax act we have not nor do we anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however the tax act requires a onetime transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments this onetime transition tax is payable over eight years with most of the cash outlay expected to be made in the later years in connection with our initial analysis we have estimated a provisional amount of 262 million of which 237 million of income taxes payable was included in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2018  see note 13  income taxes for further discussion 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes beyond the tax acts onetime transition tax which could be material 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017  we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of 025  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  and each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018  we declared a cash dividend of 030  per share and we declared 036  per share in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2018  and 2017  totaled 17 billion  and 15 billion  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  we declared a cash dividend of 036  per share to be paid on november 30 2018  with an expected payout of approximately 445 million  

during fiscal years 2018  and 2017  we repurchased 1315 million  and 375 million  shares of common stock respectively or 72 billion  and 21 billion  respectively under our ongoing share repurchase program in early fiscal 2019 we commenced the repurchase of 50 billion  of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2019 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores our developing siren retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities total capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately 2 billion  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 119 billion  for fiscal 2018  compared to 43 billion  for fiscal 2017  the change was primarily due to receipt of the upfront payment from nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 24 billion  for fiscal 2018  compared to 09 billion  for fiscal 2017  the change was primarily due to cash used to acquire the 50 ownership interest in our east china joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and additions to property plant and equipment driven by new store openings and increased store renovations partially offset by the net proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal 2018  totaled 32 billion  compared to 31 billion  for fiscal 2017  the change was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 30 2018  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of part ii of this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1  as well as risk factors in item 1a  of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk which we consider to be low excluding interest rate swaps hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years  refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs primarily coffee dairy products diesel cocoa sugar and other commodities that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30 2018  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the chinese renminbi japanese yen canadian dollar british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items see note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30 2018  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading securities portfolio trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 30 2018  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of september 30 2018  

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 30 2018  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



 availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 30 2018  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2018 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions aside from those related to the decision to close certain companyoperated stores in the us and canada which had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our 

ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

the goodwill impairment charges related to the switzerland reporting unit are discussed in note 8  other intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 13  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations andor resolution of examinations with taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes we have historically asserted our intent to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future the company continues to evaluate its plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus has not adjusted its previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the tax act while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes which could be material 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of october 1 2017   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 79  of total net revenues during fiscal 2017  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food and snack offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience  is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11  of total net revenues in fiscal 2017  licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in our share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for starbucks ®  and teavana ™  stores within certain international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

consumer packaged goods 

revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised 8  of total net revenues in fiscal 2017  our consumer packaged goods business includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of readytodrink beverages and singleserve coffee and tea products to grocery warehouse clubs and specialty retail stores it also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market starbucks seattle’s best coffee and tazobranded products through licensing agreements 

foodservice 

revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 2  of total net revenues in fiscal 2017  we sell starbucks ®  and seattle’s best coffee ®  roasted whole bean and ground coffees a selection of premium tazo ®  teas starbucks via ®  ready brew and other coffee and tearelated products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers we also sell our seattle’s best coffee ®  through arrangements with national accounts the majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation us foodservice and other distributors 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for most contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date for other contracts starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “c” coffee commodity price until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of october 1 2017  were 12 billion  comprised of 860 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 336 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of october 1 2017  none of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of october 1 2017  were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2018  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates eight  farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources our food program continues to develop and we expect the amount of food products purchased to impact our operations we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops offering premium and artisanal products and experiences in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo starbucks reserve tazo seattle’s best coffee teavana frappuccino starbucks via and la boulange are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” “tazocom” “seattlesbestcom” and “teavanacom” 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 277000 people worldwide as of october 1 2017  in the us starbucks employed approximately 185000 people with approximately 175000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations approximately 92000 employees were employed outside of the us with approximately 89000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes reduced access to credit and economic uncertainty these factors may also result in a general downturn in the restaurant industry decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships particularly in our international markets and third party manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly in our international channel development business licensees and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures they may face we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store or a licensed store we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws contaminated food store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases product recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media or result in litigation and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents can significantly reduce brand value result in civil and criminal liability and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products or the use of customer data fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration including produce such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices dairy products such as milk and cheeses nondairy alternative products such as soymilk and almondmilk and meats additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers if customers become ill from food or beverageborne illnesses tampering adulteration contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues we could be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities as well as recall products in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls or food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories 

an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not potential imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use or destruction of customers or employees data or that of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example the european union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incidents such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality additionally the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth including our priority to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend is highly dependent on our technology systems our ability to effectively manage our business launch digital and other initiatives and coordinate the production distribution administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support additionally our systems hardware software and services provided by third party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events inadequate or 

ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in third party software or services errors by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our thirdparty business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could adversely impact our business and financial results include the following 

 additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products and in some markets there are only a few retailers if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient 

levels of support for our products which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses including their licensed stores it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development business grow our teavana brand in our starbucks ® retail stores and other channels and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives such as large acquisitions and integrations we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets additionally some of our competitors are also our suppliers which may result in their ability to offer competing products at a lower price than we do increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment furthermore declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products could have a negative effect on our business including from price discounting we may have to undertake 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 70  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2017  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline especially in our us and canada markets our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate the broader cap market is now one of our two significant profit engines driving our global returns along with our north american business in particular both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenues and earnings and china in particular is a significant market for our growth a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries such as weather including the potential effects of climate change natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest and as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers or vendors a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large hightech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy including the european union’s gdpr discussed in more detail in this risk factors section food and beverage labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

financial highlights 



overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2017  continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners consolidated total net revenues increased 5 to 224 billion primarily driven by incremental revenues from 2320 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 3 growth in global comparable store sales partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week consolidated operating income declined 37 million or 1 to 41 billion operating margin declined 110 basis points to 185 primarily due to increased partner investments largely in the americas segment restructuring and impairment charges   and the absence of the 53rd week partially offset by sales leverage earnings per share of 197 increased 4 over the prior year earnings per share of 190 

americas revenue grew by 6 to 157 billion primarily driven by incremental revenues from 952 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 3 partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week the success of our premium food offerings coupled with innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms drove the increase in comparable store sales operating income declined 79 million to 37 billion and operating margin at 234 declined by 190 basis points from a year ago primarily due to increased investments in our store partners a product mix shift largely towards food and the absence of the 53rd week these were partially offset by sales leverage 

in our chinaasia pacific segment revenues grew by 10 to 32 billion primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 1036 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3 increase in comparable store sales partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week and unfavorable foreign currency translation operating income grew 21 to 765 million while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 236 the overall margin expansion was primarily due to the transition to chinas new value added tax structure in fiscal 2016 and higher income from our joint venture operations we now operate 7479 stores in 15 countries in our chinaasia pacific segment making this the second largest reportable segment 

we continue to execute on our strategy of repositioning the emea segment to a predominantly licensed model as a result of this strategy emea revenues declined 111 million to 10 billion or 10 primarily driven by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offsetting the decrease were incremental revenues from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months operating margin declined 200 basis points to 115 primarily due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to our switzerland retail business sales deleverage in certain companyoperated stores and unfavorable foreign currency exchange these decreases were partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores 

channel development segment revenues grew by 4 to 20 billion primarily driven by increased sales through our international channels and sales of packaged coffee foodservice and singleserve products when excluding the revenue of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 segment revenues grew by 6 operating income grew 86 million or 11 to 893 million operating margin increased 270 basis points to 445 primarily driven by lower coffee costs leverage on cost of sales and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture 

fiscal 2018  — the view ahead 

turning to fiscal 2018  we expect continued growth through thoughtful longterm investments that create value and reward shareholders these results are expected to be driven by our 6 operational priorities which include 

 these priorities are our main focus to grow our core business with new customer acquisition through store growth digital engagement and innovation while we continue to foster longterm customer relationships to successfully achieve these priorities we will undertake a number of initiatives including the pending transaction to acquire full ownership of our joint venture in east china and converting our taiwan and singapore markets to fully licensed operations we are in the process of exiting certain activities including closing teavana™ retail stores and certain starbucks companyoperated stores in canada the pending sale of our tazo brand and related assets and aggressively rationalizing merchandise in our us retail stores these strategic actions will enable us to focus on businesses and products with the highest growth potential and greatest prospect for returns we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits for the underlying business in fiscal 2018 driven by comparable store sales and the opening of approximately 2300 net new starbucks stores globally an additional 2 to 3 points of revenue growth is expected related to the aforementioned strategic initiatives 

diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 is expected to grow in excess of 40 when compared to fiscal 2017 largely due to the anticipated gain associated with the pending acquisition of east china 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2018  are expected to be approximately 20 billion primarily for investments in our new and existing stores our developing siren retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities 

during the fiscal year our expected strong operational performance combined with the prudent leveraging of our balance sheet will enable us to return significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends

consolidated results of operations in millions  

revenues 



total net revenues increased 11 billion  or 5  over fiscal 2016  primarily driven by increased revenues from companyoperated stores  807 million  the growth in companyoperated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new starbucks ®  companyoperated store openings over the past 12 months 869 million and a 3  increase in comparable store sales 496 million attributable to a 3  increase in average ticket partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week 324 million the absence of sales from the conversion of certain companyoperated stores to licensed stores 121 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation 70 million 

licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue  201 million  primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 260 million largely due to the opening of 1552 net new starbucks ®  licensed stores and improved comparable store sales partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week 41 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation 27 million 

cpg foodservice and other revenues increased 64 million  driven by increased sales through our international channels primarily associated with our european and north american regions 35 million increased sales of us packaged coffee 32 million foodservice 30 million and premium singleserve products 23 million increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week 47 million and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to fiscal 2017 13 million 

operating expenses

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points primarily driven by lower performancebased compensation approximately 30 basis points and employment taxes including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year approximately 20 basis points these were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms technology infrastructure and innovations 

restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in teavana we recorded 130 million of restructuring–related costs including a partial goodwill impairment of 69 million store asset impairments and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance additionally we recorded 18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our switzerland retail business 

income from equity investees increased 73 million due to higher income from our cap joint venture operations primarily china   and south korea as well as our north american coffee partnership 

the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal 2017  when compared to fiscal 2016  

other income and expenses 



interest income and other net increased 167 million  primarily driven by gains from the sale of our singapore retail operations 84 million and our investment in square inc warrants 41 million also contributing favorably was higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances 44 million 

interest expense increased 11 million  primarily related to additional interest incurred on longterm debt issued in february 2016 may 2016 and march 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our december 2016 notes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  was 332  compared to 329  for fiscal 2016  the increase  in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from nondeductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 approximately 70 basis points and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily related to statute closures approximately 30 basis points the increase was partially offset by the largely nontaxable gain on the sale of our singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 approximately 70 basis points

both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as of october 1 2017  we were in compliance 

with all applicable 2016 credit facility covenants no amounts were outstanding under our 2016 credit facility as of october 1 2017  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we increased our commercial paper program from 1 billion to 3 billion  allowing us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to this maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time individual maturities may vary but cannot exceed 397 days  from the date of issue amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including but not limited to business expansion payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases as of october 1 2017  we had no borrowings under our former commercial paper program

the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of october 1 2017  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including but not limited to additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to invest in our core businesses including capital expenditures new product innovations related marketing support and partner and digital investments return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses such as siren retail further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy as discussed in note 15  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we committed to purchase the remaining 50  ownership interest in our east china joint venture for approximately 13 billion  this transaction is expected to close by early calendar year 2018 primarily through the use of cash and investments held in foreign subsidiaries 

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of october 1 2017  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 020  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017  we declared and paid a cash dividend of 025  per share cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2017  and 2016  totaled 14504 million  and 11780 million  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  we declared a cash dividend of 030  per share to be paid on   december 1 2017  with an expected payout of approximately  4295  million

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2018 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores our developing siren retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities total capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately 2 billion  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 42 billion  for fiscal 2017  compared to 46 billion  for fiscal 2016  the change was primarily due to the timing of our cash payments for income taxes 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 09 billion  for fiscal 2017  compared to 22 billion  for fiscal 2016  the change was primarily due to the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in anticipation of the acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership share of our east china joint venture 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal 2017  totaled 30 billion  compared to 18 billion  for fiscal 2016  the change was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt the repayment of the 2016 notes and an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of october 1 2017  

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of october 1 2017  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



 availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of october 1 2017  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past four fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2017 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions aside from those related to the longterm strategy assumptions of our teavanabranded retail stores which had a significant impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our 

ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

the partial goodwill impairments of the teavana and switzerland reporting units are discussed in note 8  other intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 13  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations andor resolution of examinations with taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of october 2 2016   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region 

companyoperated stores

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10  of total net revenues in fiscal 2016  licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in our share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for teavana ®  and starbucks ®  stores within certain international markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for most contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to fix the base c coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date for other contracts starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base c coffee commodity price until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of october 2 2016  were 11 billion  comprised of 466 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 641 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of october 2 2016  approximately 7 million  of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of october 2 2016  were at the company’s option to fix the base c coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2017  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates eight  farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as la boulange ™  pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources our food program continues to develop and we expect the amount of food products purchased to impact our operations we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops and quickservice restaurants in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

trademarks copyrights patents and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo tazo seattle’s best coffee teavana frappuccino starbucks via evolution fresh and la boulange are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including starbuckscom starbucksnet tazocom seattlesbestcom and teavanacom 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income additionally as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year however since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes and reduced access to credit decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships particularly in our international markets and third party manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly in our international channel development business licensees and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food beverage and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures they may face we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store or a licensed store we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business we do not monitor the quality of nonstarbucks products served in those locations 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy contaminated food store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases product recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media or result in litigation and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial 

results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products or the use of customer data fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as food or beverageborne illnesses tampering contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water food or beverageborne illnesses tampering contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration including produce such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices dairy products such as milk and cheeses nondairy alternative products such as soymilk and almondmilk and meats additionally we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers if customers become ill from food or beverageborne illnesses tampering contamination mislabeling or other food or beveragesafety issues we could be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities as well as recall products in addition instances of food or beveragesafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls or food or beveragesafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds and allergens the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use or destruction of customers or employees data or that of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and 

governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incidents such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support additionally our systems hardware software and services provided by third party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in third party software or services errors by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could adversely impact our business and financial results include the following 



benefits to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets whether due to regulatory mandates changing industry practices or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations 

 additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products and in some markets there are only a few retailers if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient levels of support for our products which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses including their licensed stores it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development and teavana businesses and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 69  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2016  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline especially in our us and canada markets our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets some or all of our international market business units mbus which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate in particular both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenues and earnings a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the c coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including 

weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers or vendors a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our 

strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy food and beverage labeling antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

financial highlights 



overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2016  continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners employees our net revenues grew 11 over fiscal 2015 and consolidated operating margin expanded 80 basis points from 188 in fiscal 2015 to 196 in fiscal 2016 largely driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs partially offset by investments in our partners and digital platforms 

the americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2016 with revenues growing 11 to 148 billion primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6 comprised of a 5 increase in average ticket and a 1 increase in number of transactions incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the last 12 months and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 growth in our iced beverages including coffee tea and espresso paired with beverage innovation and the success of our food offerings drove the increase in comparable store sales americas operating margin grew 110 basis points to 253 in fiscal 2016 primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs partially offset by investments in our store partners and digital platforms 

our fiscal 2016 chinaasia pacific segment results reflected higher revenues from the opening of 981 net new stores over the past year incremental revenues associated with the ownership change in starbucks japan a 3 increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 215 driven by sales leverage higher income from our joint venture operations and favorability from   changes to certain business tax structures in china this favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan we now operate 6443 stores in 15 countries in our chinaasia pacific segment with continued strong performance reinforcing our confidence in the longterm growth potential of this market 

as we continue to execute our strategy of achieving the appropriate balance between companyoperated and licensed stores our emea segment revenues declined 8 to 11 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to a year ago the decline in revenues was primarily driven by lower companyoperated store revenues due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region and unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offsetting lower companyoperated store revenues were higher licensed store sales primarily resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 companyoperated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 emea operating margin declined 30 basis points to 135 primarily due to sales deleverage at certain companyoperated stores and 

unfavorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores 

the channel development segment revenues grew 12 to 19 billion in fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher sales of premium singleserve products driven by sales of starbucks ®  kcup ® portion packs the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales operating margin increased 400 basis points to 418 primarily driven by strong performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture lower coffee costs and leverage on cost of sales as seen through our channel development segment results for fiscal 2016 we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence 

fiscal 2017  — the view ahead 

turning to fiscal 2017  we expect continued strength in our revenue operating margin and earnings per share results in comparison to fiscal 2016 these results are expected to be driven by our 7 strategies for growth which include 

 in fiscal 2017 through our 7 strategies for growth we plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the mix and types of stores in our portfolio expansion of our store portfolio is expected to be coupled with continued customer attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts and our management team continues to align our leadership with our evolving businesses including the development of our global roastery and starbucks reserve ®  branded stores as a result of these efforts we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 8 in fiscal 2017 when compared to our 53week results in fiscal 2016 after excluding the approximately 400 million of additional revenue attributed to the extra week in fiscal 2016 we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 10 for fiscal 2017 based on a comparable 52week year revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales in the midsingle digits and the opening of approximately 2100 net new stores globally

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of october 2 2016  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 016  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016  we declared a cash dividend of 020  per share cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2016  and 2015  totaled 11780 million  and 9587 million  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  we declared a cash dividend of 025  per share to be paid on december 2 2016  with an expected payout of approximately  3651  million 

during fiscal years 2016  and 2015  we repurchased 349 million  and 290 million  shares of common stock respectively or 20 billion  and 14 billion  respectively under our ongoing share repurchase program on april 21 2016  we announced that our board of directors approved an increase of 100 million  shares to the program including this additional authorization of 100 million  shares the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at october 2 2016  totaled 1178 million  

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2017 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new companyoperated stores remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 16 billion  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 46 billion  for fiscal 2016  compared to 37 billion  for fiscal 2015  the change was primarily due to increased earnings the lapping of the noncash acquisition related gain for starbucks japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 22 billion  for fiscal 2016  compared to 15 billion  for fiscal 2015  the change was primarily due to the increase in purchases of investments primarily government treasury securities and corporate debt securities partially offset by the lapping of cash used to acquire sazabys 395 ownership interest in starbucks japan 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal 2016  totaled 18 billion  compared to 23 billion  for fiscal 2015  the change was primarily due to the lapping of longterm debt redemption in fiscal 2015 higher incremental proceeds from longterm debt issued in february and may 2016 over prior years issuance and lapping of cash used to fund the second tender offer step of the starbucks japan acquisition these reductions in cash used were partially offset by increased cash returned to shareholders through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2015 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of october 2 2016  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1  as well as risk factors in item 1a  of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk which we consider to be low in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years  refer to note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs primarily coffee dairy products diesel and other commodities that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2 2016  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar japanese yen chinese renminbi british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items see note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2 2016  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading securities portfolio trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in interest income and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan mdcp which is included in accrued compensation and related costs within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in our mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october 2 2016  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of october 2 2016  

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of october 2 2016  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investmentgrade debt securities the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of october 2 2016  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2016 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows 

when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

when assessing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment where we perform a qualitative assessment we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth and royalty rates which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of 

strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

for fiscal 2016 we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year during fiscal 2016 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 13  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and expected consent from taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

revenue components 

we generate nearly all of our revenues through companyoperated stores licensed stores consumer packaged goods cpg and foodservice operations 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 27 2015   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 79  of total net revenues during fiscal 2015  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products as well as complementary food and snack offerings and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience  is built upon superior customer service as well as clean and wellmaintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10  of total net revenues in fiscal 2015  licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in our share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we sell coffee tea food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for teavana ®  and seattles best coffee ®  as well as starbucks ®  stores within certain markets we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to fix the base c coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of september 27 2015  were 11 billion  comprised of 819 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 266 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of september 27 2015  approximately 38 million  of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of september 27 2015  were at the company’s option to fix the base c coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2016  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates seven  farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as la boulange ™  pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources as we continue to develop our food program we expect the amount of food products purchased to become more significant to our operations we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of material nondelivery of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops and quickservice restaurants in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season in december excluding the impact of a 28 billion cash payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to the kraft arbitration matter our cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto them the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 238000 people worldwide as of september 27 2015  in the us starbucks employed approximately 157000 people with approximately 150000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations approximately 81000 employees were employed outside of the us with approximately 78000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operation 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes and reduced access to credit decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships particularly in our international markets and third party manufacturers distributors and retailers particularly in our international channel development business licensees and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures they may face we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees and foodservice providers as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store licensed store or foodservice location we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy contaminated food recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing content or sale of our products fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of 

our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans product development initiatives and designs similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use or destruction of customers or employees data or that of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incidents such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and prevent breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as foodborne illnesses food tampering food contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering contamination mislabeling or other foodsafety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food products including our beverages and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food lineup that require freezing or refrigeration including produce such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices dairy products such as milk and cheeses and meats if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses tampering contamination mislabeling or other foodsafety issues we could be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities as well as recall products in addition instances of foodsafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores product recalls or foodsafety claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds 

can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business mobile technology including mobile payments and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support including a small number of large third party providers for some of our administrative functions additionally our systems are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets as a result we may be unable to use information systems in one market to cover system failures in such market or another market although we have security measures in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in third party software errors by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks discussed in more detail in this risk factors section if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could adversely impact our business and financial results include the following 

 12 

 additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products and in some markets there are only a few retailers if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient levels of support for our products which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses including their licensed stores it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores 

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development and teavana businesses and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including goodwill and other intangibles have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 69  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2015  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline especially in our us and canada markets our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our cap and emea operating segments some or all of our international market business units mbus which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate in particular both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both net revenues and earnings for our cap segment in the emea segment our uk mbu accounts for a significant portion of the net revenues a decline in performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of the cap and emea segments are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the c coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats eggs and energy as well as the processing of these inputs are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability whether due to supply shortages delays or interruptions in processing or otherwise especially in international markets could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers or vendors a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy food antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

financial highlights 

 overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2015  demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners employees our net revenues grew 17 over fiscal 2014 and all reportable segments drove an increase in consolidated operating income consolidated operating margin expanded to 188 from 187 in fiscal 2014 largely driven by sales leverage partially offset by the 90 basis point impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan as well as increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners employees in the americas segment the ownership change in starbucks japan reflects the change in accounting from a joint venture to a consolidated market and includes the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs 

the americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2015 with revenues growing 11 to 133 billion primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 7 comprised of a 4 increase in average ticket and a 3 increase in number of transactions as well as incremental revenues from 612 net new store openings over the last 12 months growth in our core beverages paired with the success of our food offerings and beverage innovation drove the increase in comparable store sales americas operating margin grew 80 basis points to 242 in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by sales leverage partially offset by increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners employees and digital platforms related to instore initiatives looking forward we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and moderate margin expansion through new stores and leveraging investments in both our store partners employees and our digital platforms such as mobile order and pay 

our fiscal 2015 chinaasia pacific segment results reflect the impact of fully consolidating starbucks japan since october 31 2014 incremental revenues from the change in ownership of starbucks japan were the primary driver of the 112 increase in segment revenues to 24 billion also contributing were increased sales from the opening of 767 net new stores over the past year along with a 9 increase in comparable store sales primarily driven by an 8 increase in transactions operating income grew 34 to 501 million while operating margin declined 1210 basis points to 209 the overall operating margin decline was due to the 1410 basis point impact of the ownership change in starbucks japan which was partially offset by 200 basis points of expansion primarily due to sales leverage we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company revenue growth in the future as we look forward to continued net new store openings and the first full year of 

consolidating starbucks japan in fiscal 2016 we also expect china to continue to move towards being one of our largest international markets primarily driven by expanding our retail store presence and increasing transaction growth 

our emea segment revenues declined 6 to 12 billion primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 116 million this was partially offset by revenue growth of 38 million that was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 238 net new licensed store openings over the past year emea operating margin expanded 460 basis points to 138 in fiscal 2015 primarily due to sales leverage driven by our ongoing portfolio shift to highermargin licensed stores we expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance with operating margin approaching 15 in fiscal 2016 

the channel development segment revenues grew 12 to 17 billion in fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased sales of premium singleserve products driven by sales of starbucks and tazobranded kcup ®  portion packs and improved packaged coffee sales operating margin increased 180 basis points to 378 primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and increased income due to strong performance by our north american coffee partnership joint venture we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence for fiscal 2016 we expect moderate margin expansion primarily driven by growing our premium singleserve category with innovative new beverages including the readytodrink market 

fiscal 2016  — the view ahead 

for fiscal 2016  we expect revenue growth in excess of 10 driven by strong comparable store sales slightly above the midsingle digits the addition of approximately 1800 net new stores and a 53rd fiscal week which is expected to contribute an incremental 2 to our revenue growth rate approximately onehalf of net new store openings will be in our chinaasia pacific segment with approximately 40 coming from the americas and the remaining 10 from the emea segment 

we expect consolidated operating margin and earnings per share to increase slightly in fiscal 2016 when compared to our fiscal 2015 results primarily due to leverage on revenue growth and a 53rd fiscal week which we expect to contribute approximately 006 to earnings per share partially offset by continued investments in our store partners employees in the americas segment and the development of these initiatives in our international markets as well as digital innovation 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  is expected to be between 34 to 35 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  are expected to be approximately 14 billion primarily for new stores and store renovations as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives

our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  was 293  compared to 346  for fiscal 2014  the decrease in the rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the 37 impact of the gain associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 395 ownership interest in starbucks japan upon acquisition which was almost entirely nontaxable as well as the 15 incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed in fiscal 2015 on us corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2015

income from equity investees increased 4 million driven by higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture primarily due to strong sales of bottled frappuccino ® beverages the growth in segment revenues resulted in our joint venture income declining 40 basis points as a percentage of total net revenues 

the combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 630 basis points over fiscal 2013 

all other segments 



all other segments includes teavana seattle’s best coffee evolution fresh and digital ventures 

total net revenues for all other segments increased 107 million primarily due to having an additional quarter of teavana revenues in fiscal 2014 as teavana was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 92 million 

total operating expenses increased 99 million primarily due to having an additional quarter of teavana expenses in fiscal 2014 as teavana was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2013

borrowing capacity 

our 750 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the 2013 credit facility with various banks of which 150 million  may be used for issuances of letters of credit is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we extended the duration of our credit facility which is now set to mature on january 21 2020  and amended certain facility fees and borrowing rates starbucks has the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 750 million  borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor and for us dollardenominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate as defined in the credit facility in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on the better of i the companys longterm credit ratings assigned by moodys and standard  poors rating agencies and ii the companys fixed charge coverage ratio pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility the current applicable margin is 0565  for eurocurrency rate loans and 000  for base rate loans the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as of september 27 2015  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of september 27 2015  during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we replaced the 2013 credit facility with a new 15 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the 2016 credit facility with various banks which is now set to mature on november 6 2020  the terms and conditions of the 2016 credit facility are substantially consistent with those of the 2013 credit facility 

under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion  with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days  from the date of issue 

amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility discussed above as of september 27 2015  availability under our commercial paper program was approximately 750 million  which represents the full committed credit facility amount as the amount of outstanding letters of credit was not material as of september 27 2015  the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including share repurchases business expansion payment of cash dividends on our common stock or the financing of possible acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of 93 million  for general corporate purposes we had no other borrowings under our commercial paper program during fiscal 2015  

in june 2015  we issued additional longterm debt in an underwritten registered public offering which consisted of 500 million  of 7year 2700  senior notes the 2022 notes due june 2022 and 350 million  of 30year 4300  senior notes the 2045 notes due june 2045 interest on the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes is payable semiannually on june 15  and december 15  of each year commencing on december 15 2015  see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

as discussed in note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to the 2022 notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to the 2045 notes the swap agreements were cash settled in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 at the time the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes were priced the resulting net losses from these agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense on the consolidated statements of net earnings over the lives of the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes 

in july 2015  we redeemed our 550 million  of 6250  senior notes the 2017 notes that were originally scheduled to mature in august 2017 see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

we continually evaluate liquidity and funding needs and anticipate issuing longterm debt in fiscal 2016 to provide us with financial flexibility as discussed further in note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to this anticipated debt issuance 

the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 27 2015  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

use of cash 

we expect to use our available cash and investments including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including capital expenditures new product innovations related marketing support and partner investments return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future 

as described in note 2  acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k in september 2014 we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with starbucks japan and our former joint venture partner sazaby league ltd to acquire the remaining 605  ownership interest in starbucks japan for approximately 876 million  through a twostep tender offer in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we funded the first tender offer step with 509 million  in offshore cash we funded the second tender offer step in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the related cashout procedure during the remainder of fiscal 2015 which required a combined total of 362 million  in offshore cash the remaining 6 million  of the purchase price represents cash that was unclaimed by minority shareholders as of september 27 

2015  and is recorded in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets there are no legal restrictions on the remaining unclaimed balance 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september 27 2015  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2014  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 013  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015  we declared a cash dividend of 016  per share cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2015  and 2014  totaled 9587 million  and 7831 million  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we declared a cash dividend of 020  per share to be paid on november 27 2015  with an expected payout of approximately 2970 million  

during fiscal years 2015  and 2014  we repurchased 290 million  and 210 million  shares of common stock respectively or 14 billion  and 7698 million  respectively under share repurchase authorizations on july 23 2015  we announced that our board of directors approved an increase of 50 million  shares to our ongoing share repurchase program the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at september 27 2015  totaled 527 million  

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2016 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new companyoperated stores remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately 14 billion  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 37 billion  for fiscal 2015  compared to 6078 million  for fiscal 2014  the increase was driven by lapping the prior year payment of 28 billion for the kraft arbitration matter the remaining change of 377 million was primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by changes in working capital accounts mainly due to timing 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 15 billion  for fiscal 2015  compared to 8177 million  for fiscal 2014  the change was primarily due to the use of cash to acquire sazabys 395 ownership interest in japan in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as well as lapping the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in order to fund the acquisition of starbucks japan additions to property plant and equipment also contributed driven by increased store renovations and additions for new store openings 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal 2015  totaled 23 billion  compared to 6233 million  for fiscal 2014  the change was primarily due to increased cash returned to shareholders through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2014 and cash used to redeem our 2017 notes as discussed above as well as cash used to fund the second tender offer step and the cashout procedure of the starbucks japan acquisition in fiscal 2015 these changes were partially offset by incremental proceeds from the longterm debt we issued in june of fiscal 2015 over the prior years issuance 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 27 2015  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1  as well as risk factors in item 1a  of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years  refer to 

note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our hedging instruments 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27 2015  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar japanese yen chinese renminbi british pound south korean won and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments inventory purchases and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items see note 3  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27 2015  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading securities portfolio trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan mdcp which is included in accrued compensation and related costs within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in our mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 27 2015  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to anticipated debt issuances see note 3  derivative financial instruments and note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our longterm debt respectively as of september 27 2015  

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 27 2015  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixedincome instruments the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 27 2015  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other finitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2015 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trade names and trademarks for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group fair value is the price a market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach such as a discounted cash flow or relieffromroyalty method for certain reporting units where deemed appropriate we may also utilize a market approach under the market approach fair value is estimated by reviewing prices in market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities with a similar risk profile if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 

our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition during fiscal 2015 as part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately 941 million  or 60  of our total goodwill balance of 16 billion  the majority of which resides in our japan retail us companyoperated and canada companyoperated reporting units our japan retail reporting unit which was acquired in fiscal 2015 represented approximately 730 million  of the goodwill balance that was assessed qualitatively 

as part of our ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferable assets when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when performing a qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values typically include projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate for indefinitelived intangible assets management also makes assumptions around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee for a goodwill reporting unit estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region for indefinitelived intangible assets estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset groups past performance and forecasted growth and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is 

selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective judgments and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies including retail initiatives and international expansion 

for fiscal 2015  we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year during fiscal 2015 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available as discussed in note 13  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and expected consent from taxing authorities 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected

revenue components 

we generate nearly all of our revenues through companyoperated stores licensed stores consumer packaged goods cpg and foodservice operations 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 28 2014   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 79  of total net revenues during fiscal 2014  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee tea and related products and by providing each customer with a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience  is built upon superior customer service as well as clean and wellmaintained companyoperated stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets as well as increasing sales in existing stores to support our longterm strategic objective to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including the maturity of the market 

companyoperated store data for the yearended september 28 2014  



 starbucks ®  companyoperated stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and in select rural and offhighway locations we are continuing the expansion of our various store formats including drive thru stores to provide a greater degree of access and convenience for our customers

retail sales mix by product type for companyoperated stores 



 in fiscal 2014 we moved readytodrink beverage revenues from the food category to the other category and combined packaged and singleserve teas which were previously included in the other category with packaged and single serve coffees which are now categorized as packaged and singleserve coffees and teas additionally we revised our discount allocation methodology to more precisely allocate sales discounts to the various revenue product categories none of these changes had a material impact on the composition of our retail sales mix by product type prior period amounts have been revised to be consistent with the current period presentation 

stored value cards

licensed stores 

revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10  of total net revenues in fiscal 2014  licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 

in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we receive royalties and license fees from and sell coffee tea and related products to licensees for use in their operations or resale to customers we also sell certain equipment such as coffee brewers and espresso machines to our licensees for use in their operations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for teavana ®  and seattles best coffee ®  as well as starbucks ®  stores within certain markets we also use traditional franchising

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to fix the base c coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of september 28 2014  were 11 billion  comprised of 417 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 718 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of september 28 2014  approximately 29 million  of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts and approximately 16 million  were priceprotected through the use of collar instruments all pricetobefixed contracts as of september 28 2014  were at the company’s option to fix the base c coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2015  

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates six  farmer support centers the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as la boulange ™  pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in additional countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo tazo seattle’s best coffee teavana frappuccino starbucks via evolution fresh and la boulange are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season in december excluding the impact of a 28 billion cash payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to the kraft arbitration matter our cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 191000 people worldwide as of september 28 2014  in the us starbucks employed approximately 141000 people with approximately 133000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations approximately 50000 employees were employed outside of the us with approximately 47000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes and reduced access to credit decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs our brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of the us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and joint venture relationships particularly in our international markets licensees and food service operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures they may face we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees and food services providers as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store licensed store or food service location we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy contaminated food recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity including rapidly through social or digital media or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner including with respect to the sourcing or content of our products fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs and for administrative functions as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business security breaches of our or a third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft or destruction of customers or employees data or that of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incidents which could also result in similar exposure to liability significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business like many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems but none have resulted in a material breach additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continue to make significant investments in technology third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and prevent breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply or foodsafety issues such as foodborne illnesses food tampering food contamination or mislabeling either during growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering contamination mislabeling or other foodsafety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations we have also incorporated many products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration including produce such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices dairy products such as milk and cheeses and meats if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses tampering contamination mislabeling or other foodsafety issues we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities as well as recall products in addition instances of foodsafety issues even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors could by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of foodsafety concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores or recalls as well as adverse results of claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health 

effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could adversely impact our business and financial results include construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally lack of customer acceptance of new products due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs the degree to which we enter into maintain develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of and enforce commercial and other agreements not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses or the deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets including other intangibles and goodwill have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have a material impact on our financial results 

additionally effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development business and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 73  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2014  if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our cap and emea operating segments some or all of our international market business units mbus which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both net revenues and earnings for our cap segment and our japan mbu contributes significantly to earnings in that segment in the emea segment our uk mbu accounts for a significant portion of the net revenues a decline in performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of the cap and emea segments are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the c price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the c coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base c coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores additionally and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to tea and those related to food inputs such as cocoa produce baking ingredients meats and energy are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities or lack of availability especially in international markets could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business mobile payments reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support although we have security measures in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in third party software or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through cyberattacks if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy food antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

financial highlights 

 overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2014  demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner all reportable segments contributed to strong revenue growth and collectively drove an increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin expansion 

the americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2014 with revenues growing 9 to 120 billion primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6 comprised of a 3 increase in average ticket and a 2 increase in number of transactions enhanced food offerings including the full rollout of our la boulange™ food platform in the us the impact of price increases in our retail stores and successful promotional beverages contributed to the growth in comparable store sales americas operating margin grew 190 basis points to 234 in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs looking forward we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through new stores and continued product innovation targeted at driving growth across all geographies and all dayparts we plan to continue to expand our beverage platforms and elevate our food program in part with continued enhancements to our lunch options 

in the emea segment fiscal 2014 benefited from the significant performance improvement of this segment reaching doubledigit revenue growth and increased profitability compared to the prior year revenues grew 12 to 13 billion primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and comparable store sales growth of 5 incremental revenues from 180 net new licensed store openings over the past year also contributed emea operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 92 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to sales leverage and continued cost management largely driven by the shift in our store portfolio to more licensed stores in this segment we expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards midteens operating margin over time 

our chinaasia pacific segment results reflect the growth and strong performance of new stores in the region including 250 companyoperated and 492 licensed net new store openings over the past year this new store growth along with a 7 increase in comparable store sales drove a 23 increase in total net revenues to 11 billion for fiscal 2014 operating income grew 513 million or 16 to 373 million compared to the prior year operating margin declined 200 basis points primarily resulting from the shift in the composition of our store portfolio in this segment to more companyoperated stores we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company profitability in the future we look forward to continued new store openings and the acquisition and integration of starbucks japan including expanding our presence into 

other channels in the japan market such as cpg licensing and foodservice we also expect that china will continue to grow toward being one of our largest markets outside of the us 

channel development segment revenues grew 11 to 15 billion in fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased sales of premium singleserve products lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 630 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2014 as we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores including growing our presence in the premium singleserve category we expect this segment to become a more significant contributor to future growth 

fiscal 2015  — the view ahead 

for fiscal 2015  we expect revenue growth of 16 to 18 including 6 to 7 of incremental growth from the acquisition of starbucks japan the remaining growth will primarily come from midsingledigit global comparable store sales growth and the addition of approximately 1650 net new stores approximately onehalf of net new store openings will be in our chinaasia pacific segment with the remaining half coming primarily from the americas 

we expect consolidated operating margin to decline slightly in fiscal 2015 when compared to our fiscal 2014 results primarily due to the mildly dilutive margin impact of the acquisition of starbucks japan largely driven by the change in business model from a joint venture to a companyoperated market we expect strong eps growth in fiscal 2015 due in part to an anticipated acquisitionrelated gain of approximately 325 million to 375 million aftertax or 043 to 049 per share resulting from a fair value adjustment of our current 395 ownership interest in starbucks japan we expect sales leverage to also contribute to the eps growth 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  is expected to be approximately 31 including a net tax benefit of approximately 4 from the acquisition of starbucks japan 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  are expected to be approximately 14 billion primarily for new stores and store renovations as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives 

acquisitions and divestitures

interest expense increased   36 million  due to interest on the longterm debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013

cash and investment overview 

starbucks cash and investments were 22 billion  and 33 billion  as of september 28 2014  and september 29 2013  respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we paid 28 billion for the kraft arbitration matter that was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid availableforsale securities including government treasury securities foreign and domestic corporate bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities state and local government obligations agency obligations and certificates of deposit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio was liquidated in anticipation of funding the acquisition of starbucks japan ltd starbucks japan in fiscal 2015 discussed further in note 18  subsequent event as of september 28 2014  approximately 14 billion  of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries 

borrowing capacity 

in december 2013  we issued 400 million  of 3year 0875  senior notes the 2016 notes due december 2016  and 350 million  of 5year 2000  senior notes the 2018 notes due december 2018  in an underwritten registered public offering to fund a portion of the payment required by the arbitration award in the kraft litigation matter interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 5 and december 5 of each year commencing on june 5 2014 see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for details of the components of our longterm debt 

the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 28 2014  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

our 750 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with various banks of which 150 million  may be used for issuances of letters of credit is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature on february 5 2018 we may request and the banks may grant at their discretion increases to the credit facility by a total additional amount of up to 750 million  borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor and for us dollardenominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate as defined in the credit facility in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on the 

better of i the companys longterm credit ratings assigned by moodys and standard  poors rating agencies and ii the companys fixed charge coverage ratio pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility the current applicable margin is 0795  for eurocurrency rate loans and 000  for base rate loans the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as of september 28 2014  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of september 28 2014  

under our commercial paper program as approved by our board of directors we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion  with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days  from the date of issue amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility currently we may issue up to 727 million  under our commercial paper program the 750 million  committed credit facility amount less 23 million  in outstanding letters of credit the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2014  we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of 225 million to fund a portion of the 28 billion payment for the kraft arbitration matter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of 25 million to fund other corporate purposes there were no other commercial paper borrowings during fiscal 2014  or fiscal 2013  

use of cash 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 starbucks paid all amounts due to kraft under the arbitration including prejudgment interest and attorneys fees and fully extinguished the litigation charge liability of the 27841 million  litigation charge accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 27639 million  was paid and the remainder was released as a litigation credit in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated 

we expect to use additional available cash and investments including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including new product innovations and related marketing support as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses further we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 

we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

as described further in note 18  subsequent event in september 2014 we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with starbucks japan and our joint venture partner sazaby league ltd to acquire the remaining 605  ownership interest in starbucks japan for approximately 893 million  through a twostep tender offer in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we funded the first tender offer step with approximately 511 million  in offshore cash we also expect to fund a majority of the second tender offer step with offshore cash we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates however additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september 28 2014  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

other than normal operating expenses and funding the acquisition of starbucks japan for approximately 893 million  cash requirements for fiscal 2015 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new companyoperated stores remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately 14 billion  

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 021  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2014  we declared a cash dividend of 026  per share cash dividends paid in fiscal 2014  and 2013  totaled 7831 million  and 6289 million  respectively in the fourth quarter 

of fiscal 2014  we declared a cash dividend of 032  per share to be paid on november 28 2014  with an expected payout of approximately 2398 million  

during fiscal years 2014  and 2013  we repurchased 105 million  and 108 million  shares of common stock respectively or 7698 million  and 5441 million  respectively under share repurchase authorizations the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at september 28 2014  totaled 159 million  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 6078 million  for fiscal 2014  compared to 29 billion  for fiscal 2013  the decrease was driven by the first quarter payment of 28 billion for the kraft arbitration matter discussed above this was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 34 billion primarily resulting from strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts in the current year 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 8177 million  for fiscal 2014  compared to 14 billion  for fiscal 2013  the change was primarily due to cash paid to acquire teavana in the prior year also contributing was an increase in our investments in longterm securities during fiscal 2014 more than offset by the subsequent liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in anticipation of funding the acquisition of starbucks japan 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal 2014  totaled 6233 million  compared to 1082 million  for fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividend payments in fiscal 2014  and decreased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits resulting from fewer stock option exercises during the period 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 28 2014  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality wholebean arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years  

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure such as fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 28 2014  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar japanese yen chinese renminbi british pound and euro to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated revenue streams and inventory purchases in currencies other than our functional currency the us dollar as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items see note 3  derivative financial instruments for further discussion 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 28 2014  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading securities portfolio trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan mdcp which is included in accrued compensation and related costs within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in our mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 

we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 28 2014  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

longterm debt 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixedrate debt as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to anticipated debt issuances as of september 28 2014  we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 28 2014  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixedincome instruments the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 28 2014  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below unless noted otherwise 

property plant and equipment and other definitelived assets 

we evaluate property plant and equipment and other definitelived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the assets remaining useful life 

longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for companyoperated store assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for other longlived assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate for companyoperated stores estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

during fiscal 2014 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trade names and trademarks for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group fair value is the price a market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach such as a discounted cash flow or relieffromroyalty method if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 

our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors inclusive of the size of the reporting units goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments during fiscal 2014 as part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately 104 million  or 12  of our total goodwill balance of 8562 million  the majority of which resides in our china retail us licensed and us consumer packaged goods reporting units 

as part of our ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferable assets when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when performing a qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values typically include projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses product innovation and new store concepts as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate for indefinitelived intangible assets management also makes assumptions around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee for a goodwill reporting unit estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiatives local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region for indefinitelived intangible assets estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset groups past performance and forecasted growth and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are highly subjective judgments and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies 

for fiscal 2014  we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year during fiscal 2014 there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating incomeloss 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations however we do not expect this change to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the 

judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect any of these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 29 2013   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including our ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region

licensed store data for the yearended september 29 2013  



 

consumer packaged goods 

consumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of readytodrink beverages and singleserve coffee and tea products to grocery warehouse club and specialty retail stores it also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded products through licensing agreements revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised 7  of total net revenues in fiscal 2013  

foodservice 

revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 4  of total net revenues in fiscal 2013  we sell starbucks ®  and seattle’s best coffee ®  whole bean and ground coffees a selection of premium tazo ®  teas starbucks via ®  ready brew and other coffee and tea related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers we also sell our seattle’s best coffee ®  through arrangements with national accounts the majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation us foodservice ™  and other distributors 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of september 29 2013  were 882 million  comprised of 588 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 294 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of september 29 2013  approximately 03 million  of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of september 29 2013  were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2014 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure the future supply of highquality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates farmer support centers in six  countries the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores we believe based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks ®  stores include tea and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as la boulange ™  pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market in addition to wellestablished companies in many international markets we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in additional countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo tazo seattle’s best coffee teavana frappuccino starbucks via evolution fresh and la boulange are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season in december our cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 182000 people worldwide as of september 29 2013  in the us starbucks employed approximately 137000 people with 129000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting and warehousing operations approximately 45000 employees were employed outside of the us with 43000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operation 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors lower priced products as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes reduced access to credit and lower home prices decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales net revenues operating income and earnings per share there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives which could adversely impact our business and financial results include construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally lack of customer acceptance of new products due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs the degree to which we enter into maintain develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of and enforce commercial and other agreements not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses or the deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives 

additionally effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development business and expand into new markets internationally 

where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ®  stores andor average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason including due to consumer preference for other products could have a negative effect on our business 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 74  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2013 if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our emea and cap operating segments some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large mbus in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both net revenues and earnings for our cap segment and our japan mbu contributes significantly to earnings in that segment in the emea segment our uk mbu accounts for a significant portion of the net revenues a decline in performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of the emea and cap segments are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 11 

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs our brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities 

additionally our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners including licensee and partnership relationships particularly in our international markets licensees and food service operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees and food services providers as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality products and service experience whether they visit a companyoperated store licensed store or food service location we also source our food beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly 

business incidents whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners that erode consumer trust such as contaminated food recalls or actual or perceived breaches of privacy particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and although coffee prices have come down from their nearrecord highs of 2011 they may again increase significantly due to factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically 

attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs such as tea produce baking ingredients and energy are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability 

additionally our food beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products whether accurate or not or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses food tampering and food contamination either during growing manufacturing packaging or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering or contamination could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses tampering or contamination we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores andor supply chain facilities in addition instances of foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores as well as adverse results of claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers for some of these information technology systems and support the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems including through cyber terrorism could cause material negative impacts to our product sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem furthermore security breaches of our employees or customers private data could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and our ability to retain or attract new customers and could result in litigation potential liability and the imposition of penalties 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy food antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in litigation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

financial highlights 

 

overview 

starbucks segment results for fiscal 2013  demonstrate the fundamental health of our global business model and our continued ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner our strong revenue growth of 12 and continued segment margin expansion drove increased operating cash flows which allowed us to both fund our growth initiatives and increase cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

the americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2013 with revenues growing 11 and comparable store sales growth of 7 strength in beverage innovation and promotions operational improvements and expanded food offerings all contributed to the increase in comparable store sales operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 215 driven by sales leverage store efficiencies and lower commodity costs looking forward we expect to continue to drive sales growth and profitability through new stores and enhanced product offerings including the continued roll out of la boulange ™  bakery items into all of our companyoperated stores by the end of fiscal 2014 

in the emea segment we are continuing to make steady progress toward longterm profitability in the region revenues grew 2 compared to the prior year with licensed store revenue growth nearly offset by a decline in companyoperated store revenues this reflects the shift in our ownership structure as we have closed underperforming companyoperated stores and are focused on growing our licensed store base in profitable locations comparable store sales were flat year over year but were modestly positive in the second half of fiscal 2013 emea operating margin improved to 55 in fiscal 2013 due to our ongoing cost management efforts and our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year we expect the investments we are making in this segment will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards midteens operating margin over time 

our cap segment results reflect a combination of rapid new store growth and solid performance from our existing store base including our joint venture operations in china and japan new store growth along with a 9 increase in comparable store sales drove a 27 increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2013 operating income grew 27 to 321 million and operating margin was unchanged at 35 primarily due to our rapid growth shifting away from our historically licensed model we expect this segment will become a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability in the future as we look forward to continued store openings and establishing china as our largest market outside of the us 

channel development segment revenues grew 10 in fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sales of premium single serve products lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 290 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2013 as we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores including growing our presence in the premium single serve category we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to our future growth 

our consolidated operating results included a litigation charge as a result of the conclusion of our arbitration with kraft which resulted in a pretax charge to operating expenses of 28 billion  the conclusion of this litigation is described in more detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund this expected payment both in the form of cash on hand and the expected issuance of additional debt in fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2014  — the view ahead 

for fiscal year 2014  we expect revenue growth driven by midsingledigit global comparable store sales growth 1500 new store openings and continued growth in the channel development business 

we expect fiscal year 2014 consolidated operating margin improvement when compared to our fiscal 2013 operating results excluding the litigation charge associated with the kraft arbitration of 150 to 200 basis points and strong eps growth driven primarily by leverage on revenue growth 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately 345 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  are expected to be approximately 12 billion primarily for store renovations and new stores as well for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives 

operating segment overview 

starbucks has four reportable operating segments 1 americas inclusive of the us canada and latin america markets 2 europe middle east and africa emea 3 china  asia pacific “cap” and 4 channel development all other segments includes teavana seattles best coffee and evolution fresh as well as our digital ventures business 

the americas emea and cap segments include companyoperated stores and licensed stores licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee the emea and cap segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated stores compared to the americas segment however the americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other two segments average sales per store are also higher in the americas due to various factors including length of time in market 

in certain international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher than in the us market due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the us market international markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income than the us market 

we continue to add new stores in both existing moremature markets such as the us and in newer higher growth markets such as china our disciplined approach to expanding our global store base also includes optimizing the mix of companyoperated and licensed stores in each market 

our channel development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees premium tazo ®  teas starbucks and tazobranded single serve products a variety of readytodrink beverages such as starbucks refreshers™ beverages and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores warehouse clubs specialty retailers convenience stores and us foodservice accounts readytodrink beverages are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership a joint venture with the pepsicola company the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings

the combination of the above resulted in an operating loss of 3254 million  and operating margin of 220 basis points 

other income and expenses

income taxes for fiscal year 2013  resulted in an effective tax rate of 1038  compared to 328  for fiscal year 2012 the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the litigation charge associated with the kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013 for additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k excluding the impact of the litigation charge the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to benefits from releasing certain tax reserves in fiscal 2013 and a further benefit in fiscal 2013 primarily relating to state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years these items were partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits relating to coffee procurement in the current year

cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points primarily driven by the accelerated growth of companyoperated stores which contribute a higher gross margin in china approximately 140 basis points partially offset by increased commodity costs approximately 120 basis points mainly higher coffee costs 

store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 140 basis points store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated store revenues increased 130 basis points primarily driven by increased costs associated with the expansion efforts of companyoperated stores in mainland china 

income from equity investees increased 30 million primarily driven by an increase in income from our japan approximately 11 million and shanghai approximately 10 million joint venture operations 

the combination of these changes along with increased sales leverage on depreciation and amortization approximately 10 basis points and general and administrative expenses approximately 90 basis points resulted in an increase in operating margin of 40 basis points over fiscal 2011 

channel development 



revenues 

channel development total net revenues for fiscal 2012 increased 50 or 432 million primarily due to sales of starbucks and tazobranded kcup ® portion packs approximately 232 million the benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model through the second quarter of fiscal 2012 approximately 70 million and increased foodservice revenues approximately 33 million also contributed 

operating expenses

borrowing capacity 

our previous 500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the “2010 credit facility” was set to mature in november 2014 in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we replaced the 2010 credit facility with a new 750 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the “2013 credit facility” with various banks of which 150 million  may be used for issuances of letters of credit 

the 2013 credit facility is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature on february 5 2018 starbucks has the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 750 million borrowings under the 2013 credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor and for us dollardenominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate as defined in the 2013 credit facility in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on the better of i the companys longterm credit ratings assigned by moodys and standard  poors rating agencies and ii the companys fixed charge coverage ratio pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the 2013 credit facility the current applicable margin is 0795  for eurocurrency rate loans and 000  for base rate loans the 2013 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as a result of the arbitrator’s ruling on the kraft litigation which is discussed further in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k the credit facility was amended on november 15 2013 to exclude the impact of the litigation charge including the impact on our fixed charge coverage ratio as of september 29 2013  we were in compliance with each of these covenants as amended 

under our commercial paper program as approved by our board of directors we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion  with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days  from the date of issue amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility currently we may issue up to 729 million  under our commercial paper program the 750 million  committed credit facility amount less 21 million  in outstanding letters of credit the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  there were no  borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs as of september 29 2013  and september 30 2012  a total of 21 million  and 18 million  respectively in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 

in september 2013 we issued 750 million  of 10year 385  senior notes due in october 2023 in an underwritten registered public offering interest on the notes is payable semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year commencing april 1 2014 as discussed further in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to these senior notes we cash settled these swap agreements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 at the time of the pricing of the 750 million in senior notes the resulting net gains from these agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings over the life of these senior notes 

the indentures under which our 550 million  of 10year 625  senior notes and our 750 million  of 10year 385  senior notes were issued also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 29 2013  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

use of cash 

as discussed further in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k the arbitration concluded for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with kraft as a result of the arbitration proceedings starbucks was ordered to pay kraft 223 billion in damages plus prejudgment interest and attorneys fees we have estimated prejudgment interest and attorneys fees to be approximately 557 million we expect to fund our payment to kraft through the use of available cash on hand in the us and anticipated additional issuance of debt 

we expect to use additional available cash and shortterm investments including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including new product innovations and related marketing support as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and shortterm investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september 29 2013  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

other than the expected payment to kraft and normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2014 are expected to consist primarily of new companyoperated stores capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are expected to be approximately 12 billion  

during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2012  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 017  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013  we declared a cash dividend of 021  per share cash dividends paid in fiscal 2013  and 2012  totaled 629 million  and 513 million  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we declared a cash dividend of 026  per share to be paid on november 29 2013  with an expected payout of 196 million  

during fiscal years 2013  and 2012  we repurchased 11 million  and 12 million  shares of common stock respectively or 544 million  and 593 million  respectively under share repurchase authorizations the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at september 29 2013  totaled 264 million  

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 29 billion  for fiscal year 2013  compared to 18 billion  for fiscal year 2012  the increase was primarily due to increased earnings excluding the accrued litigation charge and improvements in working capital accounts primarily driven by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 14 billion  for fiscal years 2013  compared to 974 million  for fiscal year 2012  the increase was primarily due to cash paid to acquire teavana and an increase in capital expenditures primarily for remodeling and renovating existing companyoperated stores and opening new retail stores partially offset by a net increase in cash received from investment securities 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal year 2013  totaled 108 million  compared to 746 million  for fiscal year 2012  the decrease was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the fiscal 2013 issuance of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal 2013  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 29 2013  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other items we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations and we expect commodity prices particularly coffee to impact future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results in addition to fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 29 2013  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar japanese yen chinese renminbi british pound and euro as a result we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

as of september 29 2013  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 

starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables  ie  “hedged items” that would occur within the period 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 29 2013  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 29 2013  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

debt securities 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt as of september 29 2013  and september 30 2012  we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 29 2013  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



availableforsale securities 

our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 29 2013  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable we evaluate such assets for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value for retail assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions for nonretail assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting asset useful lives further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible asset impairment loss for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate such impairment losses however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if circumstances such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value the fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

as a part of our ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferable assets when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets as noted above if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trade names and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the intangible asset group is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the intangible asset group is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the intangible asset group if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the 

implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee and a discount rate that we believe reflects the level of risk associated with receiving the future cash flows attributable to the asset estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset groups past performance and forecasted growth the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimates are subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and require management to apply judgment to estimate the reporting units or intangible asset groups fair value including estimating future cash flows and if necessary the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities further our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess impairment loss for fiscal 2013  we determined the fair value of our reporting units and intangible asset groups were substantially in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses in the foreseeable future however as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations including estimated future cash flows changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include review of our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available 

income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 

litigation accruals 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims as necessary 

our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims if any contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k describes the company’s legal and other contingent liability matters 

as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods

the americas emea and cap segments include both companyoperated and licensed stores our americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale certain markets within emea and cap operations are in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income than the americas operations the americas and emea segments also include foodservice accounts primarily in canada and the uk our americas segment also includes the retail and wholesale activities of bay bread llc doing business as la boulange which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012

revenue components 

we generate our revenues through companyoperated stores licensed stores consumer packaged goods cpg and foodservice operations 

companyoperated and licensed store summary as of september 30 2012   



the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including the ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and the ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region 

companyoperated stores 

revenue from companyoperated stores accounted for 79  of total net revenues during fiscal 2012  our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products and by providing each customer a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience  is built upon superior customer service as well as clean and wellmaintained companyoperated stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty

the following is a summary of total companyoperated store data for the periods indicated

licensed stores 

product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 9  of total revenues in fiscal 2012  in our licensed store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensees provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we receive royalties and license fees and sell coffee tea and related products for resale in licensed locations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for our seattle’s best coffee brand we use various forms of licensing including traditional franchising 

starbucks total licensed stores by country as of september 30 2012  are as follows 



in the americas 351  and 296  licensed stores were opened during 2012  and 2011  respectively and 81  and 564  licensed stores were closed during 2012  and 2011  respectively the 564 licensed stores that were closed in the americas during fiscal 2011  include 475 seattle’s best coffee locations in borders bookstores in emea 139  and 111  licensed stores were opened during 2012  and 2011  respectively and 38  and 32  licensed stores were closed during 2012  and 2011  respectively in cap 354  and 264  licensed stores were opened during 2012  and 2011  respectively and 60  and 71  licensed stores were closed during 2012  and 2011  respectively 

consumer packaged goods 

consumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of readytodrink beverages and singleserve coffee and tea products to grocery warehouse club and specialty retail stores it also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded products through licensing agreements revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised 8  of total net revenues in fiscal 2012  

foodservice 

revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 4  of total net revenues in fiscal 2012  we sell starbucks ®  and seattle’s best coffee ®  whole bean and ground coffees a selection of premium tazo ®  teas starbucks via ®  ready brew and other coffee and tea related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers we also sell our seattle’s best coffee ®  through arrangements with national accounts the majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation us foodservice ™  and other distributors 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica  coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium 

above the “c” coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica  coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments total green coffee purchase commitments as of september 30 2012  were 854 million  comprised of 557 million  under fixedprice contracts and an estimated 297 million  under pricetobefixed contracts as of september 30 2012  approximately 125 million  of our pricetobefixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of september 30 2012  were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2013 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates farmer support centers in six countries the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated stores for our largest markets the us canada and the uk we purchase substantially all of our fluid milk requirements from eight dairy suppliers we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks stores include evolution fresh™ juices and a number of readytodrink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery of these items is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and the us readytodrink coffee beverage market we also continue to face competition from wellestablished companies in many international markets 

our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through supermarkets club stores and specialty retailers and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in additional countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo seattle’s best coffee frappuccino starbucks via and tazo are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” and “seattlesbestcom” 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 160000 people worldwide as of september 30 2012  in the us starbucks employed approximately 120000 people with 113000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting and warehousing operations approximately 40000 employees were employed outside of the us with 38000  in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

risk factors   

tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operation 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 10 

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes reduced access to credit and lower home prices any resulting decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 11 

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality service convenience and price and we face significant competition in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could adversely affect our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and singleserve and readytodrink coffee beverage markets including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment as it comprised approximately 75  of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2012 if revenue trends slow or decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and for returning cash to shareholders 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our emea and cap operating segments some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large mbus in particular our japan uk and china mbus account for a significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our emea and cap segments and a decline in the performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of the emea and cap segments are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations such as in the us additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 12 

 

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and although coffee prices have come down from their nearrecord highs of 2011 they are still above the historical average price of coffee and may again increase significantly due to factors described below the highquality arabica  coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica  coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica  coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores although less material to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs and energy are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust such as contaminated food recalls or privacy breaches particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets additionally inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets as well as failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

 our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners and licensee and partnership relationships particularly in our international markets licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of certain of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience the safety of beverages or food or compliance with laws and regulations may be attributed by customers to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations 

our food and beverage products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us a vendors or suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance   

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores both domestically and internationally if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses food tampering and food contamination either during manufacturing packaging or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses tampering or contamination we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores as well adverse results of claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development business and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of highquality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed 

enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 we have recently completed several acquisitions and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures with third parties these transactions create risks such as 

 in the event of any future acquisitions we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash incur debt or take on contingent liabilities any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for administrative functions pointofsale processing and payment in our stores and online management of our supply chain starbucks cards online business and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems we also rely on third party providers for some of these information technology systems and support the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause material negative impacts to our product sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem furthermore security breaches of our employees or customers private data could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and our ability to retain or attract new customers and could result in litigation potential liability and the imposition of penalties 

 since 1988 we have offered comprehensive healthcare coverage to eligible fulltime and parttime employees in the us we currently have relatively low minimum work hour requirements for our us employees to be eligible for healthcare coverage under our healthcare plans but for various reasons many of our eligible employees choose not to participate in our plans however many of such eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so when recent changes to healthcare laws in the united states become effective in 2014 such changes include potential fees to persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage and being ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if an employee is eligible for healthcare coverage under an employers plan if a large portion of current eligible employees who 

currently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll when or after the law becomes effective it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs and negatively impact on our financial results 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements tax rules and other regulations and requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor healthcare privacy food antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

legal proceedings 

tableend in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 starbucks notified kraft foods global inc “kraft” that we were discontinuing our distribution arrangement with kraft on march 1 2011 due to material breaches by kraft of its obligations under the supply and license agreement between the company and kraft dated march 29 2004 the “agreement” which defined the main distribution arrangement between the parties through our arrangement with kraft starbucks sold a selection of starbucks and seattles best coffee branded packaged coffees in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and 

other european countries kraft managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products 

kraft denies it has materially breached the agreement on november 29 2010 starbucks received a notice of arbitration from kraft putting the commercial dispute between the parties into binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement in addition to denying it materially breached the agreement kraft further alleges that if starbucks wished to terminate the agreement it must compensate kraft as provided in the agreement in an amount equal to the fair value of the agreement with an additional premium of up to 35 under certain circumstances 

on december 6 2010 kraft commenced a federal court action against starbucks entitled kraft foods global inc v starbucks corporation  in the us district court for the southern district of new york the “district court” seeking injunctive relief to prevent starbucks from terminating the distribution arrangement until the parties dispute is resolved through the arbitration proceeding on january 28 2011 the district court denied krafts request for injunctive relief kraft appealed the district courts decision to the second circuit court of appeals on february 25 2011 the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the district courts decision as a result starbucks is in full control of our packaged coffee business as of march 1 2011 

while starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by kraft under the agreement that allowed us to terminate the agreement and certain other relationships with kraft without compensation to kraft there exists the possibility of material adverse outcomes to starbucks in the arbitration or to resolve the matter although kraft disclosed to the press and in federal court filings a 750 million offer starbucks made to kraft in august 2010 to avoid litigation and ensure a smooth transition of the business the figure is not a proper basis upon which to estimate a possible outcome of the arbitration but was based upon facts and circumstances at the time kraft rejected the offer immediately and did not provide a counteroffer effectively ending the discussions between the parties with regard to any payment moreover the offer was made prior to our investigation of krafts breaches and without consideration of krafts continuing failure to comply with material terms of the agreements 

on april 2 2012 starbucks and kraft exchanged expert reports regarding alleged damages on their affirmative claims starbucks claimed damages of up to 629 million from the loss of sales resulting from krafts failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to market starbucks ®  coffee plus attorney fees krafts expert opined that the fair market value of the agreement was 19 billion after applying a 35 premium and 9 interest kraft claimed damages of up to 29 billion plus attorney fees the arbitration hearing commenced on july 11 2012 and was completed on august 3 starbucks presented evidence of material breaches on krafts part and sought nominal damages from kraft for those breaches kraft presented evidence denying it had breached the parties agreement and sought damages of 29 billion plus attorney fees we expect a decision from the arbitrator in the first half of fiscal 2013 

at this time starbucks believes an unfavorable outcome with respect to the arbitration is not probable but as noted above is reasonably possible as also noted above starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by kraft under the agreement that allowed us to terminate the agreement without compensation to kraft in addition starbucks believes krafts damage estimates are highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis as a result we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss accordingly no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter 

starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions but except as noted above is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

financial highlights 

 

overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2012 reflect the strength of our global business model we continue to execute on our new regional operating model which we implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2012 we now have four reportable operating segments americas europe middle east and africa emea china  asia pacific cap and channel development each segment is managed by an operating segment president 

total net revenues increased 14 to 133 billion driven by global comparable store sales growth of 7  and a 50 increase in channel development revenue this growth drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margin and net earnings compared to fiscal 2011 this helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs mostly coffee which negatively impacted operating income by approximately 214 million for the year equivalent to approximately 160 basis points of impact on operating margin 

our americas business continued its strong momentum and contributed 75 of total net revenues in fiscal 2012 the revenue growth for the year was driven by an 8 increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 6 increase in traffic and a 2 increase in average ticket this sales growth combined with a continued focus on operational efficiencies drove increased sales leverage that offset the impact of higher commodity costs looking forward we expect to continue driving sales growth and profitability through continued store efficiency efforts new store development and expanding our pipeline of new product offerings to increase revenues throughout all dayparts 

emea segment results reflect both the investments we have begun making as part of our transformation plan for the region as well as the macroeconomic headwinds we and others face there this resulted in flat comparable store sales and operating income of 10 million  for fiscal 2012 a decrease of 30 million compared to fiscal 2011 we started the year by putting in place a new leadership team that is focused on increasing the starbucks brand presence health and relevancy across the region improving the profitability of the existing store base through a focus on revenue growth and operating costs and identifying opportunities for new store growth through licensing arrangements we expect the investments we are making as part of this transformation effort will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards midteens operating margin however this turnaround will take time to gain traction 

cap segment revenues increased 31  driven by new store growth and comparable store sales of 15  this segment continues to grow rapidly and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability we expect continued growth will be from a mix of new store openings and comparable store sales growth china continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us as we remain on track to reach our goal of 1500 stores in 2015 in addition other key markets such as japan korea thailand singapore and indonesia all continue to be profitable and provide a solid foundation for continued growth in the region 

our channel development segment represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us channel development results were a solid contributor to overall revenue growth with a 50  increase in revenues primarily due to sales of starbucks and tazo branded kcup® portion packs which launched at the start of fiscal 2012 and our transition to a direct distribution model for packaged coffee which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 high commodity costs continued to be a significant drag on operating margin however despite these higher costs operating income increased 61 million  to 349 million  for fiscal 2012 we expect continued innovation and new product offerings such as the verismo™ system by starbucks and starbucks refreshers™ beverages will drive further growth and profitability within this segment over time 

fiscal 2013 — the view ahead 

for fiscal year 2013 we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid singledigit increased comparable store sales new store openings and strong growth in the channel development business licensed stores will comprise between onehalf and twothirds of new store openings 

we expect continued robust consolidated operating margin and eps improvement compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting the strength of our global business and the pipeline of profitable growth initiatives 

we expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting additional investments in store renovations new store growth and manufacturing capacity 

operating segment overview 

starbucks has four reportable operating segments americas europe middle east and africa emea china and asia pacific cap and channel development seattle’s best coffee is reported in “other” along with evolution fresh digital ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 

the americas emea and cap segments include companyoperated stores and licensed stores licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee the emea and cap segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated stores compared to the americas segment however the americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other segments average sales per store are also higher in the americas due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 

starbucks store base in emea and cap continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher in certain international markets than in the americas segment due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the americas segment international markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income than the americas 

the channel development segment includes packaged coffee and tea a variety of readytodrink beverages singleserve coffee and tea products and other branded product operations worldwide as well as the us foodservice business in prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011 we sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ®  teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries through a distribution arrangement with kraft foods global inc kraft managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement during fiscal 2011 we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing advertising and promotion of these products from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores our channel development segment also includes readytodrink beverages which are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership a joint venture with the pepsicola company the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks the channel development segment reflects a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the other reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores

channel development 



revenues 

total channel development net revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 22  or 153 million  the increase was primarily due to the benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model for the majority of the year approximately 70 million on march 1 2011 we successfully transitioned to a direct distribution model from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft for the sale of packaged starbucks ®  and seattle’s best coffee ®  coffee products in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries we successfully transitioned the tazo ®  tea business to a direct distribution model in january 2011 also contributing to the increase were improved revenues from us foodservice approximately 26 million and the expanded distribution of starbucks via ®

other 



substantially all net revenues in other are generated from the seattle’s best coffee operating segment the increase in revenues for seattle’s best coffee was primarily due to the recognition of a full year of sales to national accounts added in the latter part of fiscal 2010 as well as new accounts added during fiscal 2011approximately 20 million this was partially offset by the impact of the closure of the seattle’s best coffee locations in borders bookstores 

total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 15  or 109 million  this increase is the result of an increase of 59 million in other operating expenses primarily due to the impairment of certain assets in our seattle’s best coffee business associated with the borders bankruptcy in april 2011 and an increase in marketing expenses also contributing was a 26 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to higher corporate expenses to support growth initiatives and higher donations to the starbucks foundation these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 approximately 30 million

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

investment overview 

starbucks cash and shortterm investments were 20 billion  and 21 billion  as of september 30 2012  and october 2 2011  respectively as of september 30 2012  approximately 703 million  of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries 343 million  is denominated in the us dollar we actively manage our cash and shortterm investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases our shortterm investments consisted predominantly of us treasury securities commercial paper corporate bonds and us agency securities also included in our shortterm investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year the principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limits our portfolio of longterm available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investmentgrade corporate bonds diversified among industries and individual issuers as well as certificates of deposits with maturities greater than 1 year 

borrowing capacity 

in november 2010 we replaced our previous credit facility with a new 500 million unsecured credit facility the credit facility” with various banks of which 100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit the credit facility is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in november 2014 starbucks has the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 500 million the interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility based on starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio is 085  over libor the specific spread over libor will depend upon our longterm credit ratings assigned by moody’s and standard  poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as of september 30 2012  and october 2 2011  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 500 million with individual maturities that may vary but not 

exceed 397 days from the date of issue the program is backstopped by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is 500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing may be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases during fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs as of september 30 2012  and october 2 2011  a total of 18 million  and 17 million  respectively in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

the 550 million  of 10year 625  senior notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 30 2012  and october 2 2011  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our cash and shortterm investments including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including new product innovations and related marketing support as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and shortterm investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future 

we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september 30 2012 to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material we do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 

we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

as discussed further in note 15 we are in arbitration with kraft foods global inc “kraft” for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with kraft as a part of those proceedings kraft has claimed damages inclusive of a premium and interest for terminating the arrangement we believe we have valid claims of material breach by kraft under the agreement we also believe kraft’s claim is highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis however should the arbitration result in an unfavorable outcome we believe we have adequate liquidity 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2013 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure new companyoperated stores and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be approximately 12 billion 

during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 013  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012  we declared and paid a cash dividend of 017  per share cash dividends paid in fiscal 2012  and 2011  totaled 513 million  and 390 million  respectively in the fourth quarter we declared a cash dividend of 021  per share to be paid on november 30 2012  with an expected payout of 157 million  

during fiscal years 2012  and 2011  we repurchased 12 million  and 16 million  shares of common stock  593 million  and 556 million  respectively under share repurchase authorizations the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at september 30 2012  totaled 121 million  on november 14 2012  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 25 million  shares under our share repurchase program 

cash flows 

cash provided  by operating activities was 18 billion  for fiscal year 2012  compared to 16 billion  for fiscal year 2011  the slight increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings in fiscal 2012 this was partially offset by a net increase in our working capital accounts due primarily to increased payments on accounts payable 

cash used  by investing activities totaled 10 billion  for fiscal years 2012 and 2011  net cash proceeds on investment maturities were offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily for remodeling and renovating existing companyoperated stores and opening new retail stores the absence of cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate in the prior year and cash paid to acquire evolution fresh and bay bread llc doing business as la boulange in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 respectively 

cash used  by financing activities for fiscal year 2012  totaled 746 million  compared to 608 million  for fiscal year 2011  the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal 2012  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 30 2012  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  



 starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other things we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica  coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to a market price risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results in addition to fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30 2012  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in commodity prices the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions  



foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen as a result we may engage in 

transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

as of september 30 2012  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 

starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables  ie  “hedged items” that would occur within the period 

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30 2012  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  



equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 30 2012  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt as of september 30 2012  and october 2 2011  we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 30 2012  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  



our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component 

of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of september 30 2012  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

asset impairment 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may not be recoverable we evaluate longlived assets for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value for retail assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions for nonretail assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting asset useful lives further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess longlived asset impairment loss for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill impairment 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if circumstances such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair valueswhen evaluating goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount if not we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value the fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a 

willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit and require management to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units including estimating future cash flows and if necessary the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities further our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies 

as a part of our ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferable assets under gaap when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets as noted above if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss for fiscal 2012  we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future however as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations including estimated future cash flows changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

self insurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date these liabilities which are associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

our selfinsurance reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date periodically we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our selfinsurance reserves 

during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our selfinsurance reserves we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our selfinsurance reserves for the foreseeable future however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our selfinsurance reserves at september 30 2012  would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million in fiscal 2012  

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of our position for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold we record a related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available 

income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to us income taxes we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future if these amounts were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 

litigation accruals 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims as necessary 

our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims if any contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim note 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the company’s legal and other contingent liability matters 

as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations

consumer packaged goods 

consumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea to grocery and warehouse club stores it also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded products through licensing agreements revenues from sales of packaged coffee and tea comprised 4 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 in prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011 we sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries through a distribution arrangement with kraft foods global inc kraft managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement during fiscal 2011 we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing advertising and promotion of these products from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores we also sell packaged coffee and tea directly to warehouse club stores in international markets 

revenues from licensing our branded products accounted for 1 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 we license the rights to produce and market starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded products through several partnerships both domestically and internationally we also sell ingredients to these licensees to manufacturer our branded products significant licensing agreements include 

 

  

  

  

   

foodservice 

revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 4 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 we sell starbucks ® and seattle’s best coffee ® whole bean and ground coffees a selection of premium tazo ® teas starbucks via ® ready brew and other related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers we also sell our seattle’s best coffee ® through arrangements with national accounts the majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation us foodservice tm  and other distributors 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity coffee price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments as of october 2 2011 we had a total of 10 billion in purchase commitments of which 193 million represented the estimated cost of pricetobefixed contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of october 2 2011 were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2012 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates farmer support centers in costa rica and rwanda among other locations the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores our highest volumes of dairy purchases are in the us canada and the uk for these markets we purchase substantially all of our fluid milk requirements from seven dairy suppliers we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support these retail businesses is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas as well as our selection of 

  

readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and continue to face competition from wellestablished companies in many international markets and in the us readytodrink coffee beverage market 

our whole bean coffees ground packaged coffees tazo ® teas and starbucks via ® ready brew compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through supermarkets club stores and specialty retailers our whole bean coffees coffee beverages and starbucks via ® ready brew compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in many additional countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo seattle’s best coffee frappuccino starbucks via and tazo are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” and “seattlesbestcom” 

research and development 

our research and development teams are responsible for the technical development of food and beverage products and new equipment we spent approximately 15 million 9 million and 7 million during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of our business 

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

  

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 149000 people worldwide as of october 2 2011 in the us starbucks employed approximately 112000 people with 106000 in companyoperated stores and the remainder in support facilities store development and roasting and warehousing operations approximately 37000 employees were employed outside of the us with 35000 in companyoperated stores and the remainder in regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the risks and factors listed below however are not exhaustive other sections of this 10k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operation 

 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes reduced access to credit and lower home prices any resulting decreases in customer traffic andor average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

  

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality service convenience and price and we face significant competition in each of our channels and markets accordingly we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could adversely affect our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and readytodrink coffee beverage markets could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment 

 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our us operating segment as it comprised approximately two thirds of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2011 if revenue trends slow or decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected and because the us segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and for returning cash to shareholders 

 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our international operations some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of our international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large mbus in particular our canada japan uk and china mbus account for a significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our international operations and a decline in the performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in some international markets may not 

  

embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in our us market or other international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations additionally our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market 

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and over the last two years the base “c” coffee commodity price has increased markedly the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially 

  

mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores although less material to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs and energy are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust such as contaminated food or privacy breaches particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets 

 

 our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners and licensee and partnership relationships particularly in our international markets licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experiencethe safety of beverages or food or compliance with laws and regulations may be attributed by customers to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations 

our food and beverage products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us a vendor or supplier’s failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability 

 

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales operating cash flows and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

  

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees who we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 

 some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are coffeefree and have reduced calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses food tampering and food contamination either during manufacturing packaging or preparation have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or damages clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses tampering or contamination we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores as well adverse results of claims or litigation could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 

 a health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity our business could be severely affected customers might avoid public gathering places such as our stores in the event of a health pandemic and governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease there is also a risk of customer contamination from being served food or beverage by an employee who has been infected with the disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our stores the impact of a health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

  

 effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our global consumer products business and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 

 from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures with third parties these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event of any future acquisitions we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash incur debt or take on contingent liabilities any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our stores starbucks cards online business and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem security breaches of our employees or customer private data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties 

 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements regulations and tax requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable trade labor privacy food antibribery and corruption and merchandise laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 starbucks notified kraft foods global inc “kraft” that we were discontinuing our distribution arrangement with kraft on march 1 2011 due to material breaches by kraft of its obligations under the supply and license agreement between the company and kraft dated march 29 2004 the “agreement” which defined the main distribution arrangement between the parties through our arrangement with kraft starbucks sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries kraft managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products 

kraft denies it has materially breached the agreement on november 29 2010 starbucks received a notice of arbitration from kraft putting the commercial dispute between the parties into binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement in addition to denying it materially breached the agreement kraft further alleges that if starbucks wished to terminate the agreement it must compensate kraft as provided in the agreement in an amount equal to the fair value of the agreement with an additional premium of up to 35 under certain circumstances the parties are now engaged in extensive discovery with an arbitration trial expected in mid 2012 

on december 6 2010 kraft commenced a federal court action against starbucks entitled kraft foods global inc v starbucks corporation  in the us district court for the southern district of new york the “district court” seeking injunctive relief to prevent starbucks from terminating the distribution arrangement until the parties’ dispute is resolved through the arbitration proceeding on january 28 2011 the district court denied kraft’s request for 

  

injunctive relief kraft appealed the district court’s decision to the second circuit court of appeals on february 25 2011 the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court’s decision as a result starbucks is in full control of our packaged coffee business as of march 1 2011 

while starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by kraft under the agreement that allowed us to terminate the agreement and certain other relationships with kraft without compensation to kraft there exists the possibility of material adverse outcomes to starbucks in the arbitration or to resolve the matter at this time the company is unable to estimate the range of possible outcomes with respect to the arbitration as we have not received any statement or articulation of damages from kraft nor have we estimated the damages to starbucks caused by kraft’s breaches information in this regard will be provided during the discovery process and is currently expected to be available in late march or early april 2012 and although kraft disclosed to the press and in federal court filings a 750 million offer starbucks made to kraft in august 2010 to avoid litigation and ensure a smooth transition of the business the figure is not a proper basis upon which to estimate a possible outcome of the arbitration but was based upon facts and circumstances at the time kraft rejected the offer immediately and did not provide a counteroffer effectively ending the discussions between the parties with regard to any payment moreover the offer was made prior to our investigation of kraft’s breaches and without consideration of kraft’s continuing failure to comply with material terms of the agreements 

starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions but except as noted above is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

financial highlights 

 

  

  

 overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2011 reflect the strength and resiliency of our business model the global power of our brand and the talent and dedication of our employees our business has performed well this year despite significant headwinds from commodity costs and a continuingly challenging consumer environment strong global comparable stores sales growth of 8 for the full year us 8 and international 5 drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings this helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs which negatively impacted eps by approximately 020 per share for the year equivalent to approximately 220 basis points of operating margin most of the commodity pressure was related to coffee with dairy cocoa sugar and fuel accounting for the rest 

our us business continued its strong momentum and contributed 69 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 we saw benefits from a variety of initiatives including our loyalty program innovative products such as our starbucks petites ® platform and other new food and beverage options we also continued to refine our store efficiency efforts including the rollout of our new pointofsale and inventory management systems in our companyoperated stores the combination of these efforts resulted in strong comparable store sales of 8 which translated to an increase in sales leverage which more than offset the effect of higher commodity costs 

our international portfolio which contributed 22 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 continues to improve with an operating margin of 13 for the year we continue to leverage the valuable lessons learned from the turnaround of our us business and continue to make progress on scaling the infrastructure of this segment we are aggressively pursuing the profitable expansion opportunities that exist outside the us including disciplined growth and scale in our more mature markets and faster expansion in key emerging markets like china 

our global consumer products group “cpg” represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us during the second quarter we successfully transitioned our packaged coffee and tea businesses to an inhouse direct model away from the previous distribution arrangement this model now gives us total control over the sellin and distribution to retailers of these products we also aggressively pursued the opportunities beyond our more 

  

traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee and other products in multiple forms across new categories and through diverse channels leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base examples include the ongoing global expansion of our successful starbucks via ® ready brew product and starbucks and tazobranded kcup ® portion packs which were added to the lineup at the start of fiscal 2012 cpg contributed 7 of total net revenues in fiscal 2011 

looking toward the future we recently announced a reorganization of our leadership structure that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012 the new structure will enable us to accelerate our global multibrand multichannel strategy and to leverage the talent experience and expertise resident in our senior leadership team in this new structure one president will oversee all operations within each of three distinct regions with responsibility for the performance of companyoperated stores as well as for working with licensed and jointventure business partners in each market within their respective region the region president will also be responsible for working with starbucks global consumer products and foodservice teams to further develop those businesses and execute against our growth plan within the region the three new regions will be 1 americas inclusive of the us canada and latin america 2 china and asia pacific and 3 europe middle east and africa collectively referred to as the emea region 

fiscal 2012 — the view ahead 

for fiscal year 2012 we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid singledigit increased comparable store sales new store openings and strong growth in the cpg business licensed stores will comprise between onehalf and twothirds of new store openings in the americas emea and china and asia pacific regions 

we expect modest consolidated operating margin and eps improvement compared to fiscal 2011 given our current revenue expectations along with ongoing spend related to our expanding cpg inhouse direct distribution model and higher commodity costs 

we expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 reflecting additional investments in store renovations and in manufacturing capacity 

operating segment overview 

through the end of fiscal 2011 starbucks had three reportable operating segments us international and cpg our seattle’s best coffee operating segment is reported in “other” along with our digital ventures business and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 

the us and international segments both include companyoperated stores and licensed retail stores licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated stores compared to the us segment however the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature us segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the international segment average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels further certain market costs particularly occupancy costs are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment which comprise a more diverse group of operations as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment the number of stores the higher unit volumes and the lower market costs the us segment despite its higher relative percentage of companyoperated stores has a higher operating margin than the lessdeveloped international segment 

starbucks international store base continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china newer 

  

international markets require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 

the cpg and seattle’s best coffee segments include packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide as well as the us foodservice business in prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011 we sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries through a distribution arrangement with kraft foods global inc kraft managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing advertising and promotion of these products from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores our cpg segment also includes readytodrink beverages which are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership a joint venture with the pepsicola company the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the other two reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores

operating expenses 

 

 cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points the increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs approximately 220 basis points mainly driven by increased coffee costs partially offsetting this increase was lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues approximately 70 basis points driven by increased sales leverage

the above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 150 basis points for fiscal 2011 considering the impact from all line items the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage approximately 300 basis points the absence of restructuring charges in the current year approximately 50 basis points and the gain on the sale of properties approximately 30 basis points these increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs approximately 220 basis points 

  

other income and expenses

income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2011 resulted in an effective tax rate of 311 compared to 340 for fiscal 2010 the lower rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a benefit from the switzerland and austria transaction and to an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 33

partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 

 

 net interest income and other increased 13 million over the prior period the increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in france in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to 

  

fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately 10 million this favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations approximately 11 million which related primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables 

income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 340 compared to 301 for fiscal 2009 the lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement

operating expenses included in other relate to seattle’s best coffee and digital ventures as well as expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments total operating expenses increased 405 million primarily as a result of increased general and administrative expenses 80 million primarily due to higher performancebased compensation in 2010 this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 58 million in restructuring charges due to the completion of our restructuring activities within the nonstore support organization

 financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

investment overview 

starbucks cash and shortterm investments were 21 billion and 14 billion and as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 respectively as of october 2 2011 approximately 3675 million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries 695 million is denominated in the us dollar we actively manage our cash and shortterm investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases our shortterm investments consisted predominantly of us treasury securities commercial paper corporate bonds and us agency securities also included in our shortterm investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service “cdars” with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year which we began investing into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 the principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limits 

our portfolio of longterm available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investmentgrade corporate bonds diversified among industries and individual issuers as well as certificates of deposits placed through cdars with maturities greater than 1 year we also have investments in auction rate securities “ars” all of which are classified as longterm ars totaling 28 million and 41 million were outstanding as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 respectively the reduction in ars was due to 16 million in redemptions during the fiscal year with all redemptions done at par while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ars investments for some period of time we do not believe this will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures shareholder dividends or other business requirements 

borrowing capacity 

starbucks previous 1 billion unsecured credit facility the “2005 credit facility” was available through november of 2010 when we replaced the 2005 credit facility with a new 500 million unsecured credit facility the “2010 credit facility” with various banks of which 100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit 

the 2010 credit facility is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in november 2014 starbucks has the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 500 million the interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility based on starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio is 1075 over libor the specific spread over libor will depend upon 

  

our longterm credit ratings assigned by moody’s and standard  poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio as with the 2005 credit facility the 2010 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

under starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 500 million with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the program is backstopped by the 2010 credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is 500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases the 2005 credit facility was also paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion the commercial paper program was secured by the 2005 credit facility and the combined borrowing limit was 1 billion for the commercial paper program and the credit facility during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 there were no borrowings under the credit facilities or commercial paper programs as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 a total of 17 million and 15 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the respective revolving credit facility 

the 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

use of cash 

we expect to use our cash and shortterm investments including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including new product innovations and related marketing support as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and shortterm investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future however in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our international cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes 

we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2012 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure new companyoperated stores and additional investments in manufacturing capacity total capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are expected to be in the range of approximately 800 million to 900 million 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we declared our first ever cash dividend to shareholders of 010 per share during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and each subsequent quarter through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of 013 per share totaling 390 million and 171 million paid in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively in the fourth quarter we declared a cash dividend of 017 per share to be paid on december 2 2011 with an expected payout of 127 million 

during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we repurchased 16 million and 11 million shares of common stock 556 million and 286 million respectively under share repurchase authorizations the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at october 2 2011 totaled 24 million 

  

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion for fiscal year 2011 compared to 17 billion for fiscal year 2010 the slight decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories resulting in part from higher coffee prices partially offset by higher net earnings for the period and an increase in payables primarily related to green coffee purchases 

cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2011 totaled 10 billion compared to 790 million for fiscal year 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased purchases of availableforsale securities and increased capital expenditures for remodeling and renovating existing companyoperated stores opening new retail stores and investments in information technology systems the increase was partially offset by increased maturities and calls of availableforsale securities and cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate during the year 

cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2011 totaled 608 million compared to 346 million for fiscal year 2010 the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and common share repurchases in fiscal 2011 the increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits resulting from more stock option exercises during the period 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of october 2 2011 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions

offbalance sheet arrangement 

offbalance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

  

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other things we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our companyoperated stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates we manage our exposure to various marketbased risks according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk additionally this policy restricts among other things the amount of marketbased risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

commodity price risk 

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results in addition to fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges as of october 2 2011 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen as a result we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

as of october 2 2011 we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 

starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie “hedged items” that would occur within the period 

  

the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2 2011 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  

 

 equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october 2 2011 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

interest rate risk 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt as of october 2 2011 and october 3 2010 we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of october 2 2011 on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  

 

 our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of october 2 2011 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

  

we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

asset impairment 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may not be recoverable we evaluate longlived assets for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value for retail assets the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions for nonretail assets fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances which may include discounted cash flows comparable transactions or comparable company analyses 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting asset useful lives further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess longlived asset impairment loss for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

goodwill impairment 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if circumstances such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value the fair value of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expenses and discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units including estimating future cash flows and if necessary the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities further our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies 

  

as a part of our ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferrable assets under gaap when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets as noted above if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss for fiscal 2011 we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future however as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations including estimated future cash flows changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

stockbased compensation 

we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period for stock option awards we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the foreseeable future however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in stockbased compensation expense that could be material in the future for fiscal 2011 a 10 change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would have changed stockbased compensation expense by approximately 15 million for fiscal 2011 

operating leases 

we lease retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases we provide for an estimate of our asset retirement obligation “aro” at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term our estimates of aros involve assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs the initial aro asset and liability represent the present value of the estimated future costs to complete the required work the aro asset is depreciated over the same timeframe as the associate leasehold improvements and the liability is accreted over time future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 

we occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease for vacated locations with remaining lease commitments we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs eg real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term net of expected future sublease rental income key assumptions in our 

  

estimate of future cash flows include estimated sublease income and lease termination costs these estimates are based on historical experience our analysis of the specific real estate market including input from independent real estate firms and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict cash flows are discounted using a rate that coincides with the remaining lease term 

the liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods the amount and timing of future settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 

during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our key assumptions for our lease abandonment accrual at october 2 2011 would not have had a significant impact on net earnings for fiscal 2011 

self insurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date these liabilities which are associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date periodically we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our selfinsured liabilities 

during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our selfinsurance liabilities we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our selfinsurance liabilities for the foreseeable future however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our selfinsurance reserves at october 2 2011 would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2011 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

  

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 

litigation accruals 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims as necessary 

our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims if any contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim footnote 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the company’s legal and other contingent liability matters 

as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods

 item 1 business tableend general 

starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world operating in more than 50 countries starbucks corporation was formed in 1985 and its common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market “nasdaq” under the symbol “sbux” starbucks purchases and roasts highquality whole bean coffees and sells them along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh food items through companyoperated retail stores we also sell coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed retail stores and through certain of our licensees and equity investees we produce and sell a variety of readytodrink beverages all channels outside the companyoperated retail stores are collectively known as specialty operations in addition to our flagship starbucks brand our portfolio includes brands such as tazo ® tea seattle’s best coffee ®  and starbucks via ® ready brew 

our objective is to maintain starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world to achieve this goal we plan to continue disciplined expansion of our retail and licensed store base primarily focused on growth in countries outside of the us in addition by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model we are offering consumers new coffee products in multiple forms across new categories and through diverse channels starbucks global responsibility strategy and commitments related to coffee and the communities we do business in as well as our focus on being an employer of choice are also key complements to our business strategies 

in this annual report on form 10k “10k” or “report” for the fiscal year ended october 3 2010 “fiscal 2010” starbucks corporation together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “starbucks” the “company” “we” “us” or “our” 

segment financial information 

starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states “us” international and global consumer products group “cpg” in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 we changed the composition of our reportable segments by creating a seattle’s best coffee operating segment and reporting it with our unallocated corporate expenses and digital ventures in “other” financial information for seattle’s best coffee was previously reported within the us international and cpg segments this change reflects the culmination of internal management and reporting realignments and the expected development of the seattle’s best coffee business segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change each of the segments provided the following percentage of total net revenues for fiscal year fiscal 2010 us 71 international 21 cpg 7 and other 1 

the us and international segments both include companyoperated retail stores and certain components of specialty operations specialty operations within the us include licensed retail stores international specialty operations include retail store licensing operations in nearly 40 countries and foodservice accounts primarily in canada and the united kingdom “uk” our international segment’s largest markets based on number of companyoperated and licensed retail stores are canada japan and the uk the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea starbucks via ® ready brew and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores warehouse clubs and convenience stores and us foodservice accounts cpg operates a significant portion of its business through licensing arrangements and a joint venture with a large consumer products business partner this operating model leverages the business partners’ existing infrastructures and as a result our cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to starbucks us and international reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores 

financial information about starbucks segments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this 10k 

  

revenue components 

we generate our revenues through companyoperated retail stores and our specialty operations specialty operations include retail stores licensed by local business partners packaged coffee and tea sold through licensees in grocery and warehouse club stores license arrangements with business partners to use our brands on various products and arrangements with foodservice companies that service a variety of locations outside our retail store footprint 

companyoperated and licensed retail store summary as of october 3 2010 

 

 the mix of companyoperated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors including the ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for starbucks and the ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region 

companyoperated retail stores 

revenue from companyoperated retail stores accounted for 84 of total net revenues during fiscal 2010 our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products and by providing each customer a unique starbucks experience  the starbucks experience is built upon superior customer service as well as clean and wellmaintained companyoperated retail stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty 

our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in existing markets opening stores in new markets and increasing sales in existing stores to support our long term strategic objectives store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors including the maturity of the market 

the following is a summary of total companyoperated retail store data for the periods indicated 

 

  

 

   

  

 starbucks retail stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings university campuses and in select rural and offhighway locations to provide a greater degree of access and convenience for nonpedestrian customers we continue to selectively expand development of drivethru retail stores 

starbucks stores offer a choice of regular and decaffeinated coffee beverages a broad selection of italianstyle espresso beverages cold blended beverages iced shaken refreshment beverages a selection of premium teas distinctively packaged roasted whole bean coffees and a variety of starbucks via ® ready brew soluble coffees starbucks stores also offer a variety of fresh food items including selections focusing on highquality ingredients nutritional value and great flavor food items include pastries prepared breakfast and lunch sandwiches oatmeal and salads as well as juices sodas and bottled water we continue to expand the food warming program in the us and canada with close to 90  of the stores in these markets providing warm food items as of the end of fiscal 2010 a focused selection of beveragemaking equipment and accessories are also sold in the stores each starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the size of the store and its location in companyoperated starbucks stores in the us we provide customers free access to wireless internet 

retail sales mix by product type for companyoperated stores 

 

 starbucks card 

the starbucks card program is designed to increase customer loyalty and the frequency of store visits by cardholders since january 2010 starbucks customers in the us have earned free beverages through the my starbucks rewards program gold level members earn a free drink after fifteen purchases at participating starbucks stores members also receive free select syrups milk options and refills on tea or brewed coffee during a store visit starbucks cards are accepted at all companyoperated and most licensed stores in north america the cards are also accepted at a number of international locations 

specialty operations 

during fiscal 2010 specialty revenues accounted for 16 of total net revenues our specialty operations strive to develop starbucks brands outside the companyoperated retail store environment through a number of channels starbucks strategy to reach customers where they work travel shop and dine includes establishing and maintaining relationships with prominent third parties that share our values and commitment to quality these relationships take various forms including licensing arrangements foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to our core businesses in certain situations starbucks has an equity ownership interest in licensee operations 

  

licensing — retail stores 

product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from us and international licensed retail stores accounted for 50 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2010 in our licensed retail store operations we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience licensee partners provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements we receive royalties and license fees and sell coffee tea and related products for resale in licensed locations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores for our seattle’s best coffee brand we use various forms of licensing including traditional franchising 

starbucks total licensed retail stores by region and country at fiscal year end 2010 are as follows 

 

 in the us 166 and 286 licensed stores were opened during 2010 and 2009 respectively and 106 and 251 stores were closed during 2010 and 2009 respectively internationally 335 and 375 licensed stores were opened during 2010 and 2009 respectively and 100 and 84 stores were closed during 2010 and 2009 respectively 

licensing — packaged coffee and tea 

revenues from licensed sales of packaged coffee and tea comprised 23 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2010 for over ten years through licensing relationships with kraft foods global inc we have sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries kraft has managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products 

we also sell packaged coffee and tea internationally directly to warehouse club stores such as costco wholesale corporation 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 starbucks notified kraft that we are discontinuing our licensing relationships we intend to work closely with kraft to ensure an orderly transition 

licensing — branded products 

the revenues from licensed branded products accounted for 4 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2010 we license the rights to produce and market starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded products through several partnerships both domestically and internationally significant licensing agreements include 

 

   

  

  

 foodservice 

revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 23 of total specialty revenues in fiscal 2010 we sell whole bean and ground coffees including the starbucks and seattle’s best coffee brands as well as a selection of premium tazo ® teas starbucks via ® ready brew and other related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers we also sell our seattle’s best coffee ® through arrangements with national accounts the majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation us foodservice tm  and other distributors 

product supply 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards we control coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees 

the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices both the premium and the “c” coffee commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market including hedge funds and commodity index funds in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates farmer support centers in costa rica and rwanda the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

we buy coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee pricetobefixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established for these types of contracts either starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “c” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date until prices are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments as of october 3 2010 we had a total of 557 million in purchase commitments of which 401 million represented the estimated cost of pricetobefixed contracts all pricetobefixed contracts as of october 3 2010 were at the company’s option to fix the base “c” coffee commodity price component total purchase commitments together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2011 

we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationships established with our suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

  

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores starbucks highest volumes of dairy purchases are in the us canada and the uk for these markets we purchase substantially all of our fluid milk requirements from six dairy suppliers we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support these retail businesses is remote 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas as well as our selection of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations we believe based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers that the risk of nondelivery is remote 

competition 

our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which we do business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and continue to face competition from wellestablished companies in many international markets and in the us readytodrink coffee beverage market 

our whole bean coffees ground packaged coffees tazo ® teas and starbucks via ® ready brew compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through supermarkets club stores and specialty retailers our whole bean coffees coffee beverages and starbucks via ® ready brew compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks specialty operations face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the us and in many additional countries throughout the world some of our trademarks including starbucks ®  the starbucks ® logo seattle’s best coffee ®  frappuccino ®  starbucks via ® ready brew and tazo ® are of material importance the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials we also hold patents on certain products systems and designs in addition starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” “starbucksnet” and “seattlesbestcom” 

research and development 

our research and development teams are responsible for the technical development of food and beverage products and new equipment we spent approximately 9 million 7 million and 7 million during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of its business 

  

seasonality and quarterly results 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results can be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

starbucks employed approximately 137000 people worldwide as of october 3 2010 in the us starbucks employed approximately 107000 people with 101000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in administrative and regional offices and store development roasting and warehousing operations approximately 30000 employees were employed outside of the us with 29000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant we believe our current relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the risks and factors listed below however are not exhaustive other sections of this 10k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations moreover we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business financial condition or results of operation 

 

 our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies increased fuel and energy costs higher interest rates higher taxes reduced access to credit and lower home prices any resulting decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

  

 

 there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality service convenience and price and we face significant competition in each of our channels and markets in the us the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages could adversely affect our sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and readytodrink coffee beverage markets could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment see also the discussion under “competition” in item 1 

 

 our financial performance is highly dependent on our us operating segment which comprised approximately threequarters of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2010 although the us segment’s operating results have improved significantly primarily due to our restructuring efforts substantially completed in 2009 and to improved revenue trends if the operational improvements are not sustained going forward andor the revenue trends slow or decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

 

 our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of the international operating segment some or all of our international market business units “mbus” which we generally define by the countries or regions in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of our international operating segment may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large mbus in particular our canada japan and uk mbus account for a significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our international operating segment and a decline in the performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of our international operating segment 

additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in new international markets into which we and our licensees expand may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in our existing markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations 

  

our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to our longterm growth prospects 

 

 we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and in fiscal 2010 the base “c” coffee commodity price increased markedly the highquality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above the “c” price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices see discussion of “product supply” in item 1 above and hedging activities increases in the cost of highquality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of our companyoperated retail stores although less material to our operations than coffee or dairy other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs and energy are important to our operations increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

  

 failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance 

 

 a health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity our business could be severely affected customers might avoid public gathering places such as our stores in the event of a health pandemic and governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our stores the impact of a health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

 

 we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of us where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less wellknown we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our products are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets 

 

 our business strategy including our plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of business partners and licensee and partnership relationships particularly in our international markets licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages food and other products directly to customers we provide training and support to and monitor the operations of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control including financial pressures we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food may be attributed by customers to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations 

our products and in particular our coffee and tea products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us a vendor or supplier’s failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability 

  

 much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional companyoperated store model our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees who we rely on to give customers a superior instore experience accordingly our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

 

 some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we have a variety of beverage and food items including items that are low in caffeine and calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses and food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could in the future affect us as well any report linking us to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims clean water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 

 effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model increase our focus on our global consumer products business and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet our financial targets to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

  

 from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures with third parties these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event of any future acquisitions we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash incur debt or take on contingent liabilities any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

 we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our stores starbucks cards online business and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

 

 our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws accounting and reporting requirements regulations and tax requirements including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable labor laws the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may result in damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements 

 

 any reduction in cash flow relative to the level of our financial obligations would result in an increase in leverage any increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition an increase in leverage could raise the likelihood of a financial covenant breach which in turn could limit our access to existing funding under our credit facility 

our ability to satisfy our operating lease obligations and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends on our future performance should we experience deterioration in operating performance we will have less cash flow available to meet these obligations in addition if such deterioration were to lead to the 

  

closure of underperforming stores we would need to fund the costs of terminating store leases if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations we may be required to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms

financial highlights 

 

  

  

 overview 

starbucks results for fiscal 2010 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts over the last two years to improve the health of our core business and to position the company for sustained profitable growth into the future strong comparable stores sales growth of 7 for the year us 7 and international 6 combined with a more efficient operating structure drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings the operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal 2009 in our supply chain and companyoperated stores have driven reduced product costs and store waste as well as instore labor savings concurrent with improved customer satisfaction scores these improvements were partially offset by higher performance based compensation expenses in fiscal 2010 and by higher marketing expenses to support the launch of starbucks via ® ready brew in the grocery channel and the introduction of our new customizable frappuccino ® blended beverage in our us business we will continue to refine our store efficiency efforts while pursuing a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 

while the reinvigorated us business has been the primary driver of starbucks improved consolidated financial results the profitability of our international business continues to improve driven primarily by increased sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies our management continues to focus on our international business by leveraging the valuable lessons learned in the us we intend to capitalize on the large expansion opportunities that exist outside the us including continued growth and scale in our more mature existing markets and emphasis on expansion in key emerging markets like china and brazil 

our global consumer products group “cpg” represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution we are aggressively pursuing the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee products in multiple forms across new categories and through diverse channels leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base examples include the ongoing expansion of our successful starbucks via ® ready brew product and the ongoing growth in points of distribution for seattle’s best coffee 

starbucks continues to generate strong operating cash flows which provide us the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment and spending in both our core business and new growth platforms while also returning cash 

  

to shareholders we generated 17 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and finished the year with 14 billion in cash and shortterm investments and no shortterm debt in fiscal 2010 we returned approximately 460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends 

fiscal 2011 — the view ahead 

 

  

  

 operating segment overview 

starbucks has three reportable operating segments us international and cpg in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 we changed the composition of our reportable segments by creating a seattle’s best coffee operating segment and reporting it with our unallocated corporate expenses and digital ventures in other financial information for seattle’s best coffee was previously reported within the us international and cpg segments 

the us and international segments both include companyoperated retail stores and licensed retail stores licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated compared to the us segment however the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature us segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the international segment average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels further certain market costs particularly occupancy costs are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment which comprises a more diverse group of operations as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment the number of stores the higher unit volumes and the lower market costs the us segment despite its higher relative percentage of companyoperated stores has a higher operating margin excluding restructuring costs than the lessdeveloped international segment 

starbucks international store base continues to expand and as we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china and brazil newer international markets require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 

the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide and the us foodservice business for over ten years through licensing relationships with kraft foods global inc we have sold a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada the uk and other european countries kraft has managed the distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 starbucks notified kraft that we are discontinuing our licensing relationships we intend to work closely with kraft to ensure an orderly transition we also sell packaged coffee and tea internationally directly to warehouse club stores such as costco wholesale corporation 

our cpg segment also includes readytodrink beverages which are manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership a joint venture with the pepsicola company in the cpg segment most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and readytodrink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue and the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture are included on a net basis in 

  

income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the other two reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores

results of operations — fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

consolidated results of operations in millions 

 

 consolidated net revenues were 107 billion for fiscal 2010 an increase of 95 over fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase in companyoperated retail revenues driven by a 7 increase in global comparable stores sales contributing approximately 551 million the increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4 increase in number of transactions contributing approximately 298 million and a 3 increase in average value per transaction contributing approximately 253 million also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 approximately 207 million foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the us dollar primarily in relation to the canadian dollar approximately 101 million and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in france approximately 87 million this increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 companyoperated stores from fiscal 2009 approximately 119 million 

 

   

cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points the decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs approximately 70 basis points and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs approximately 50 basis points also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues approximately 80 basis points primarily due to sales leverage 

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues 

restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008 the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures with the previouslyannounced store closures essentially complete we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities 

partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 

 

 net interest income and other increased 13 million over the prior period the increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in france in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately 10 million the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings this favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations approximately 11 million which relate primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables 

income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 340 compared to 301 for fiscal 2009 the lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be in the range of 34 to 35

results of operations — fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

consolidated results of operations in millions 

 

 companyoperated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008 primarily attributable to a 6 decline in comparable store sales comprised of a 4 decline in transactions and a 2 decline in the average value per transaction foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger us dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment with a comparable store sales decline of 6 for the year the international segment experienced a 2 decline in comparable store sales

the relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009 as a result of the audit settlement approximately 17 million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings

 financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

starbucks cash and shortterm investments were 14 billion and 666 million as of october 3 2010 and september 27 2009 respectively we actively manage our cash and shortterm investments in order to internally fund operating needs make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through common stock dividend payments and share repurchases our shortterm investments consisted predominantly of us treasury and us agency securities 

our portfolio of longterm available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investmentgrade corporate bonds diversified among industries and individual issuers we also have investments in auction rate securities “ars” nearly all of which are classified as longterm ars totaling 41 million and 56 million were outstanding as of october 3 2010 and september 27 2009 respectively the reduction in ars was due to 12 million in redemptions during the fiscal year with all redemptions done at par while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ars investments for some period of time we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures shareholder dividends or other business requirements 

starbucks 1 billion unsecured credit facility the “2005 credit facility” was available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes in november of 2010 subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year we replaced the 2005 credit facility which was scheduled to mature in august 2011 the new credit facility is described in more detail below the 2005 credit facility was paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion the commercial paper program was secured by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit was 1 billion for the commercial paper program and the credit facility during fiscal 2010 and 2009 there were no borrowings under the 2005 credit facility or commercial paper program as of october 3 2010 a total of 15 million in letters of credit were outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

the 2005 credit facility contained provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of october 3 2010 and september 27 2009 we were in compliance with each of these covenants the 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of october 3 2010 and september 27 2009 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

in november of 2010 subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year we replaced the 2005 credit facility with a 500 million unsecured credit facility the “2010 credit facility” with various banks of which 100 million may be 

  

used for issuances of letters of credit the 2010 credit facility is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases the new 2010 credit facility is currently set to mature in november 2014 the interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility based on starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio is 150 over libor the specific spread over libor will depend upon our longterm credit ratings assigned by moody’s and standard  poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses starbucks has the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 500 million under starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 500 million with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the program is backstopped by the 2010 credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is 500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs capital expenditures and other corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases 

we expect to use our cash and shortterm investments including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core businesses including new product innovations and related marketing support as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses we believe that cash flow generated from operations and existing cash and shortterm investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase ownership interest in our equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2011 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated retail stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure and new companyoperated retail stores total capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are expected to range from 550 million to 600 million 

in march 2010 starbucks declared its first ever cash dividend to shareholders at 010 per share this quarterly dividend was paid on april 23 2010 the third quarter dividend was raised to 013 per share and was paid on august 20 2010 bringing the total cash dividend payout for fiscal 2010 to 171 million on september 14 2010 we declared a cash dividend of 013 per share to be paid on december 3 2010 with an expected payout of 97 million starbucks repurchased 11 million shares of common stock 286 million during fiscal 2010 under share repurchase authorizations the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the fiscal year totaled 10 million subsequent to year end on november 15 2010 we announced an additional share repurchase authorization made by the board of directors in the amount of up to 10 million shares in addition to the 10 million remaining under the previous authorization 

cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to 14 billion for fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher net earnings for the period 

cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled 790 million as compared to 421 million in fiscal 2009 the increase results primarily from the use of a portion of our available cash balances to purchase us agency and investment grade bonds capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 totaled 441 million primarily for remodeling and renovating existing companyoperated retail stores opening new retail stores and investment in information technology systems 

cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled 346 million as compared to 642 million in fiscal 2009 the change primarily reflects net repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings under the credit facility totaling 713 million in fiscal 2009 offset by dividend payments of 171 million and common share repurchases of 286 million in fiscal 2010

we purchase commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results in addition to fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges as of the end of fiscal 2010 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us we have transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen as a result we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

as of october 3 2010 starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 

starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie “hedged items” that would occur within the hedging period 

the following table summarizes the potential impact to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  

october 3 2010 

 

 equity security price risk 

we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within our trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the mdcp a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of the end of fiscal 2010 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

  

interest rate risk 

we utilize shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions  

october 3 2010 

 

 our availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity as of october 3 2010 our longterm availableforsale securities included ars please see note 3 for further information availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our availableforsale securities we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our availableforsale securities as of the end of fiscal 2010 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we consider our policies on asset impairment goodwill stockbased compensation operating leases self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

asset impairment 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may not be recoverable we evaluate longlived assets for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value for store assets the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future store revenues and operating costs using internal projections for other assets we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting asset useful lives further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

  

goodwill impairment 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for consolidated entities in our third fiscal quarter 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units including estimating future cash flows and if necessary the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities further our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations including estimated future cash flows changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

as a part of starbucks ongoing operations we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reasons we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other nontransferrable assets under gaap when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors as a result when closing individual stores we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets as noted above if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 

stockbased compensation 

we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period for stock option awards we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation however a 10 change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year 2010 

operating leases 

we lease retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases we provide for an estimate of asset retirement obligation “aro” expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated in addition the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which we have operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 

  

self insurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 

in addition our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances we believe that our estimates are reasonable however actual results could differ from these estimates

product supply 

 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with its rigorous coffee standards starbucks controls its coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in its operations the company purchases green coffee beans from coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends and single origin coffees 

 

the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by the company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather 

political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

 

to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees and to reinforce the company’s leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates farmer support centers in costa rica and rwanda the farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields 

 

the company buys coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee as of september 27 2009 the company had 238 million of purchase commitments which together with existing inventory is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2010 

 

the company depends upon its relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green coffee the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

 

in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores the company’s highest volume of dairy purchases are in the us canada and the uk for these markets starbucks purchases substantially all of its fluid milk requirements from six dairy suppliers the company believes based on relationships established with these suppliers the risk of nondelivery of sufficient fluid milk to support these retail businesses is remote 

 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas and the company’s selection of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty suppliers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are purchased from national regional and local sources coffeemaking equipment such as drip and coffee press coffeemakers espresso machines and coffee grinders are generally purchased directly from their manufacturers beveragerelated accessories including items bearing the company’s logos and trademarks are produced and distributed through contracts with a number of different suppliers the company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups and cutlery from several companies to support the needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations the company believes based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers the risk of nondelivery is remote 

 

competition 

 

the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue the company believes that its customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price starbucks has been experiencing greater direct competition from large competitors in the us quickservice restaurant sector and continues to face competition from wellestablished companies in many international markets and in the us readytodrink coffee beverage market 

 

the company’s whole bean coffees and ground packaged coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets club stores and specialty retailers the company’s whole bean coffees its coffee beverages and its recently launched soluble coffee via compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks specialty operations face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 

 

starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season the company’s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

 

employees 

 

the company employed approximately 142000 people worldwide as of september 27 2009 in the us starbucks employed approximately 111000 people with 105000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s administrative and regional offices and store development roasting and warehousing operations approximately 31000 employees were employed outside of the us with 30000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of the company’s employees represented by unions is not significant starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

starbucks is including this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “act” for forwardlooking statements this 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act forwardlooking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they often include words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “estimates” “intends” “plans” “seeks” or words of similar meaning or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “should” “could” “may” “aims” “intends” or “projects” a forwardlooking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances and those future events or circumstances may not occur investors should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report these forwardlooking statements are all based on currently available operating financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the company’s actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below 

 

if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs starbucks business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the factors listed below are not exhaustive other sections of this 10k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact starbucks business financial condition and results of operations moreover starbucks operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on starbucks business financial condition or results of operation or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not rely on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results any or all of the forwardlooking statements contained in this 10k and any other public statement made by starbucks or its management may turn out to be incorrect starbucks expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

  

the company’s operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors many of which are largely outside the company’s control any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact starbucks business financial condition andor results of operations 

 

  

 8 

 

  

  

  

  

  

there is no assurance that the company will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with its expectations which may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to drive longterm shareholder value and improve starbucks results of operations and include 

 

  

  

as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending the company’s results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions starbucks customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies reduced access to credit and falling home prices any resulting decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction will negatively impact the company’s 

financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time consumers may make longlasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis 

 

  

the company’s failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to operating margins earnings per share comparable store sales and net revenues will likely result in a decline andor increased volatility in the market price of starbucks stock 

 

  

the company’s financial performance is highly dependent on its us operating segment which comprised approximately threequarters of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2009 the company continued to experience negative traffic in its us stores in fiscal 2009 which adversely affected the operating results of the us segment and the company as a whole although the us segment’s operating results improved in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the company’s restructuring efforts if improvements in its financial performance do not continue the company’s business and financial results will continue to be adversely affected 

 

  

the company’s future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of its international operating segment some or all of the company’s international market business units “mbus” which starbucks generally defines by the countries or regions in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of the international operating segment may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the company’s large mbus additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting the company’s us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in new international markets into which starbucks and its licensees expand may not embrace starbucks products to the same extent as consumers in the company’s existing markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of the company’s international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations the company’s international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 

 10 

 

  

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries which are important to the company’s longterm growth prospects 

 

  

starbucks canada japan and uk markets account for a significant portion of the net revenues and profit contribution of the company’s international operating segment any significant decline in the financial performance of one of these key markets may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the entire international operating segment if not partially or fully offset by positive financial performance from the other two major markets 

 

  

a description of the general competitive conditions in which starbucks operates appears under “competition” in item 1 in the us the continued focus by one or more large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages at a low cost has attracted starbucks customers and could if the numbers become large enough adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations in those markets the company faces increased competition from larger wellknown competitors which have greater resources increasing competition from the us packaged coffee and tea and readytodrink coffee beverage markets could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment and the company’s results of operations given its premium brand starbucks may be impacted more severely than its competitors by customers trading down to lower priced coffee beverages and related products 

 

  

a health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity the company’s business could be severely affected starbucks has positioned itself as a third place between home and work where people can gather together for human connection customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic and local regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores the impact of a health pandemic on starbucks might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

 

  

starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of its products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for its corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies to be successful in the future particularly outside of us where the starbucks brand is less wellknown management believes it must preserve grow and leverage the value of the starbucks brand across its sales channels brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if the incidents 

receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for the company’s products and its brand equity could diminish significantly if starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its products is perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of its markets 

 

  

the company’s business strategy including its plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of licensee and partnership relationships particularly in its international markets licensees are often authorized to use the starbucks logo and provide starbucksbranded beverages food and other products directly to customers the company provides training and support to and monitors the operations of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver to starbucks customers may be diminished by any number of factors beyond the company’s control including financial pressures management believes customers expect the same quality of products and service from the company’s licensees as they do from starbucks and the company strives to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food may be attributed by customers to starbucks thus damaging the company’s reputation and brand value and potentially affecting the results of operations 

 

the company’s products and in particular its coffee and tea products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors the company relies on international vendors to provide high quality product that comply with applicable laws the company’s ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us these issues could negatively impact the company’s business and profitability 

 

  

the company’s success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees and on its ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage starbucks stores starbucks must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality store employees could jeopardize the company’s ability to meet its financial targets 

 

  

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as starbucks expands into new markets internationally where it must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with the company’s goals philosophy and standards growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet the company’s financial targets to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 

  

some starbucks products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects there has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles combined with excessive consumption of highcalorie foods have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity particularly in the us there is increasing consumer awareness of health 

risks including obesity due in part to increasing publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while starbucks has a variety of healthier choice beverage and food items including items that are low in caffeine and calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in the company’s products or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity could significantly reduce the demand for the company’s beverages and food products 

 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses and food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could in the future affect the company as well any report linking starbucks to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering could damage its brand value immediately and severely hurt sales of its beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims clean water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee beverages the company’s ability to ensure a clean water supply to its stores is limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses the company could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect starbucks sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of the company’s stores could materially harm the company’s business and results of operations 

 

  

any reduction in cash flow relative to the level of the company’s financial obligations would result in an increase in leverage any increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in starbucks credit ratings which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase its cost of obtaining financing in addition an increase in leverage could raise the likelihood of a financial covenant breach which in turn could limit the company’s access to existing funding under its credit facility 

 

the company’s ability to satisfy its operating lease obligations and make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness depends on its future performance should the company experience deterioration in operating performance it will have less cash flow available to meet these obligations in addition if such deterioration were to lead to the closure of underperforming stores the company would need to fund the costs of terminating store leases if starbucks is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations it may be required to among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable starbucks to satisfy its financial obligations in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 

 

  

starbucks relies heavily on information technology systems across its operations including for management of its supply chain pointofsale processing in its stores and various other processes and transactions the company’s ability to effectively manage its business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of its products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could 

cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of the company’s operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

 

  

starbucks policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable labor laws additional legal and regulatory requirements together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which the company operates and the related cost of compliance failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in damage to starbucks reputation civil and criminal liability fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of the company’s financial statements

general 

 

starbucks corporation’s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30 the fiscal years ended on september 27 2009 september 28 2008 and september 30 2007 all included 52 weeks starbucks 2010 fiscal year will include 53 weeks with the 53 rd week falling in its fourth fiscal quarter all references to store counts including data for new store openings are reported net of related store closures unless otherwise noted 

 

overview 

 

fiscal 2009 was a challenging year for starbucks the company was confronted with extraordinary economic and operating challenges in addition to facing an increasingly competitive landscape although the global economy has shown some signs of improvement recently management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many consumers are still facing and does not expect that to significantly change over the course of fiscal 2010 this challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending in the us and internationally which in turn has impacted company revenues comparable store sales operating income and operating margins starbucks responded to this difficult environment with a more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of initiatives to permanently improve the company’s cost structure the result is an underlying business model that is less reliant on high revenue growth to drive profitability and that still preserves the fundamental strengths and values of the starbucks brand the primary initiatives in this strategy include rationalizing the global companyoperated store portfolio rightsizing the nonretail support organization and reducing the company’s cost structure while renewing the focus on service excellence in the stores and delivering relevant innovation 

 

starbucks actions to rationalize its global store portfolio have included the planned closure of nearly 1000 companyoperated stores globally at the end of fiscal 2009 nearly all of the approximately 800 us companyoperated stores 61 stores in australia and 41 companyoperated stores in other international markets had been closed the remaining international store closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2010 

 

initiatives targeting reductions in the company’s cost structure in fiscal 2009 proceeded as planned with fullyear costs of 580 million removed from the company’s cost structure these targeted cost reductions and associated operational efficiency efforts along with a more profitable companyoperated store base have moved starbucks toward a more sustainable business model while preserving the fundamental strengths and values of the brand the operational efficiency efforts are primarily focused on store level execution and include improved staffing models and better management of waste in coffee dairy and food 

 

starbucks actions to improve the customer experience have resulted in a more focused effort toward instore offerings and simplifying the demands on store partners employees while concurrently raising alreadyhigh standards for beverage and food offerings customer service and the overall instore experience the effects of these efforts have already been seen in the company’s improved customer satisfaction scores 

 

starbucks has a renewed focus on relevant product innovation and the disciplined expansion and leveraging of its existing products and sales channels for example starbucks via tm ready brew coffee was launched in fiscal 2009 and is designed to capture a significant share of both the 21 billion global instant coffee category and the singleserve market the company intends to drive sales within the retail store base and cpg channels both in the us and internationally 

 

the company continues to maintain a solid financial foundation with no short term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2009 and with cash and liquid investments totaling more than 650 million this solid financial position and continued strong cash flow generation have provided starbucks with the financial flexibility to implement its restructuring efforts as well as make ongoing investments in its core business 

 

fiscal 2010 — the view ahead 

 

for fiscal 2010 the company expects revenues to grow in the lowtomid single digits compared to fiscal 2009 driven by modestly positive comparable store sales a 53 rd fiscal week and approximately 100 planned net new 

stores in the us and approximately 200 net new stores in international markets both the us and international net new additions are expected to be primarily licensed stores 

 

given these revenue expectations combined with the company’s reduced cost structure instore operating efficiencies and lower restructuring charges starbucks currently expects significant improvement in its consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2010 operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 is currently expected to reach approximately 14 billion and capital expenditures are expected to range from 500 million to 550 million 

 

operating segment overview 

 

starbucks has three reportable operating segments us international and cpg the us foodservice business which was previously reported in the us segment is now reported in the cpg segment as a result of internal management realignments within the us and cpg businesses segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change 

 

the us and international segments both include companyoperated retail stores and licensed retail stores licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated compared to the us segment however the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature us segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the international segment average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels further certain market costs particularly occupancy costs are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment which comprises a more diverse group of operations as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment the number of stores the higher unit volumes and the lower market costs the us segment despite its higher relative percentage of companyoperated stores has a higher operating margin excluding restructuring costs than the lessdeveloped international segment 

 

the company’s international store base continues to expand and starbucks has been focusing on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china brazil and russia the company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 

 

the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide and the us foodservice business for the packaged coffee and tea and branded products starbucks operates primarily through licensing arrangements and joint ventures with large consumer products business partners most significantly with kraft for distribution of packaged coffees and teas and the north american coffee partnership with the pepsicola company for manufacturing and distribution of readytodrink beverages this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and readytodrink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner not by the cpg segment royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue and the proportionate share of the results of the company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the company’s other two reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores 

 

expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses related depreciation and amortization expenses corporate restructuring charges and amounts included in net interest income and other and interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings

results of operations — fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

 

financial highlights 

 

  

consolidated results of operations in millions 

 

 

 

companyoperated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008 primarily attributable to a 6 decline in comparable store sales comprised of a 4 decline in transactions and a 2 decline in the average value per transaction foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger us dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment with a comparable store sales decline of 6 for the year the international segment experienced a 2 decline in comparable store sales 

 

the company derived 16 of total net revenues from channels outside the companyoperated retail stores collectively known as specialty operations the decrease in foodservice and other revenue was primarily due to the softness in the hospitality industry 

 

 

 

cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of instore operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste and due to lower dairy costs in the us partially offset by higher coffee costs 

 

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of starbucks restructuring efforts and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies 

 

restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize the company’s global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in companyoperated stores partially offset by increased restructuring charges 

 

 

 

net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on the company’s trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008 as described in more detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under its management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term 

borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year at the end of fiscal 2009 the company had no short term debt 

 

the relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009 as a result of the audit settlement approximately 17 million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of 34 to 35 

 

operating segments 

 

segment information is prepared on the same basis that the company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes starbucks has three reportable operating segments us international and cpg unallocated corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments operating income represents earnings before net interest income and other interest expense and income taxes 

 

the us foodservice business which was previously reported in the us segment is now reported in the cpg segment as a result of internal management realignments within the us and cpg businesses segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change 

 

the following tables summarize the company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2009 and 2008  in millions

companyoperated retail revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a 6 decrease in comparable store sales comprised of a 4 decrease in transactions and a 2 decrease in average value per transaction 

 

 

 

operating margin expanded primarily due to lower store operating expenses lower cost of sales including occupancy costs and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues this improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in companyoperated stores and to lower nonstore support costs partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year the company incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period 

 

international 

 

the international operating segment sells coffee and other beverages complementary food whole bean coffees and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through companyoperated retail stores in canada the uk and several other markets specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly 40 other countries and foodservice accounts primarily in canada and the uk the company’s international store base continues to expand and starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels many of the company’s international operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income than in the us this continuing investment is part of the company’s longterm balanced plan for profitable growth 

 

 

companyoperated retail revenues decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates particularly for the british pound and canadian dollar partially offsetting the decrease were the net new store openings of 89 companyoperated stores 

 

specialty revenues decreased primarily due to continued softness in the hospitality industry and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

 

 

 

operating margin decreased primarily due to higher restructuring charges and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues restructuring charges of 270 million recognized during the year had a 50 basis point impact on operating margin compared to the prior year due to the previously announced store closures higher store operating expenses as of percentage of companyoperated retail revenues were driven by an increase in store impairment charges and a decline in sales leverage impacting salaries and benefits partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin were lower other operating expenses due to headcount reductions in the nonstore support functions 

 

global consumer products group 

 

cpg’s licensing revenue is from selling a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium tazo ® teas through licensing arrangements in us and international markets and also producing and selling a variety of readytodrink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements the foodservice revenue is from the us foodservice business which sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks 

 

 

total net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from packaged coffees partially offset by lower foodservice revenues caused by continued softness in the hospitality industry 

 

 

 

growth of operating margin was primarily due to lower other operating expenses in the foodservice business due to lower compensation costs and lower marketing expenses 

 

unallocated corporate 

 

unallocated corporate expenses pertain to corporate administrative functions that support but are not specifically attributable to the company’s operating segments 

 

 

 

total unallocated corporate expenses increased primarily as a result of restructuring charges incurred for corporate office facilities that were no longer occupied by the company due to the reduction in positions within the nonstore support organization 

 

results of operations — fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

consolidated results of operations in millions 

 

 

net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both companyoperated retail revenues and specialty operations 

 

during fiscal 2008 starbucks derived 84 of total net revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new companyoperated retail stores in fiscal 2008 offset by negative 3 comparable store sales for the same period revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008 the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5 for the year partially offsetting this was 2 comparable store sales growth in the international segment within fiscal 2008 consolidated quarterly revenue growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the us 

 

the company derived the remaining 16 of total net revenues from specialty operations licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008 the increase in foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the foodservice business in the us 

 

 

 

since many of the company’s operating expenses are fixed in nature the softness in us revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and us segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales and pressured operating margins 

 

cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the us business primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new companyoperated retail stores in fiscal 2008 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payrollrelated expenses restructuring charges include asset impairment lease exit and severance costs these costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the us and australia and the rationalization of the company’s leadership structure and nonstore organization 

operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues in addition restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40 of the decrease 

 

 

 

net interest income and other decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the company’s trading securities portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under its mdcp plan the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings interest expense increased due to the company’s issuance of 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes in august of fiscal 2007 

 

income taxes for fiscal 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 313 compared to 363 for fiscal 2007 the lower rate was due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the us 

 

united states 

 

 

companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 445 new companyoperated retail stores in fiscal 2008 partially offset by a 5 decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2008 the us companyoperated retail business continued to experience deteriorating trends in transactions during the year driven by the us economic slowdown licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 438 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

operating margin contracted significantly primarily due to restructuring charges incurred and to softer revenues due to weak traffic as well as higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues restructuring charges of 2109 million had a 280 basis point impact on the operating margin the increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales higher payrollrelated expenditures and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments 

 

international 

 

 

 

companyoperated retail revenues increased due to the opening of 236 new companyoperated retail stores in fiscal 2008 favorable foreign currency exchange rates primarily on the canadian dollar and comparable store sales growth of 2 for fiscal 2008 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 companyoperated retail revenues grew at a slower rate yearoveryear of 12 and comparable store sales were flat compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2007 both driven by slowdowns in the uk and canada due to the weakening global economy 

specialty revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 550 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

operating margin decreased primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs driven by continued expansion of lunch and warming programs in canada higher distribution costs and higher building maintenance expense due to store renovation activities in addition restructuring charges of 192 million recognized in fiscal 2008 had a 90 basis point impact on the operating margin nearly all due to the closure of 61 companyoperated stores in australia 

 

global consumer products group 

 

 

foodservice revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts and licensing revenue increased due to higher royalties and product sales in the international readytodrink business and increased sales of us packaged tea and international club packaged coffee 

 

 

 

growth of operating margin was primarily due to lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues partially offset by lower income from equity investees lower cost of sales was primarily due to a sales mix shift to more profitable products 

 

unallocated corporate 

 

 

 

total unallocated corporate expenses remained relatively flat due to lower payrollrelated expenditures which were offset by restructuring charges incurred for corporate office facilities that were no longer occupied by the company due to the reduction in positions within starbucks leadership structure and nonstore organization 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company’s existing cash and liquid investments were 6661 million and 3223 million as of september 27 2009 and september 28 2008 respectively 

 

the company manages its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings 

 

included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following 

 

 33 

 

as of september 27 2009 the company had 927 million invested in availableforsale securities included in availableforsale securities were 557 million of auction rate securities “ars” compared with 598 million of ars held as of september 28 2008 with the decrease due to calls of individual securities as described in more detail in note 3 while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time the company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs capital expenditures or other business requirements 

 

credit rating agencies currently rate the company’s borrowings as follows 

 

 

 

on august 28 2009 standard and poor’s ratings services revised its outlook on the company’s credit ratings to stable from negative based on improved credit metrics and stabilizing performance the rating agency also affirmed the bbb corporate credit rating on the company and raised the shortterm rating to a2 from a3 to conform with the stable rating outlook as a result of the moody’s p3 shortterm rating issued in may 2009 commercial paper has become less liquid and more expensive than borrowing under the company’s credit facility consequently the company utilized its credit facility for almost all shortterm borrowing needs subsequent to may 2009 in the latter half of the year the company reduced its total shortterm borrowings to a zero balance due to strong operating cash flows and lower capital spending on new companyoperated stores management is unlikely to make significant use of its commercial paper program until its moody’s shortterm ratings improve 

 

despite limited access to the commercial paper markets management believes that cash flow from operations and its existing cash and liquid investments supplemented as needed by the 1 billion in shortterm borrowing capacity under the company’s revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and related costs from the remaining international store closures significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

 

the company’s credit facility contains provisions requiring starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio on june 8 2009 the credit facility was amended to more accurately reflect the parties’ intent with respect to amendment no 4 to the credit facility amendment no 5 to the credit facility did not impact the company’s borrowing terms facility size or covenant ratio and was completed at minimal cost to the company as of september 27 2009 and september 28 2008 the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

the 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 also require starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 27 2009 and september 28 2008 the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

the company generated strong operating cash flow during the year ended september 27 2009 and used its free cash flow to reduce its shortterm borrowings from 7130 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to a zero balance at the end of fiscal 2009 and to increase the balance of its cash and liquid investments 

 

the company expects to use its cash and liquid investments including any borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in its core businesses including new beverage and product innovations as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses the company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the company’s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent 

 

depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program starbucks 

did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2009 under the company’s share repurchase program however the company will continue to evaluate share repurchases and cash dividends in the future as a use for excess cash generated by the business 

 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2010 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of and equipment upgrades for existing companyoperated retail stores systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure and new companyoperated retail stores total capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are expected to range from 500 million to 550 million 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 14 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to 13 billion for fiscal 2008 cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2009 totaled 4211 million compared to 11 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to opening significantly fewer new companyoperated stores 

 

cash used by financing activities for the year ended september 27 2009 totaled 6422 million with net repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings under the credit facility totaling 7131 million as of september 27 2009 a total of 141 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility leaving 9859 million of capacity available under the 1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility 

 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 27 2009 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  

 

 

 

 

  

starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility 

 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

 

commodity price risk represents the company’s primary market risk generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products among other things the company purchases roasts and sells highquality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

 

financial risk management 

 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and interest rates the company manages its exposure to various marketbased risks according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk additionally this policy restricts among other things the amount of marketbased risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity in general hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

 

the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

 

commodity price risk 

 

the company purchases commodity inputs including coffee dairy products and diesel that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results in addition to fixedprice contracts and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases the company has entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges as of the end of fiscal 2009 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

the majority of the company’s revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of the company’s operations consists of activities outside of the us the company has transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen as a result starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

 

as of september 27 2009 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan as well as the company’s net investments in its canada subsidiary to minimize foreign currency exposure 

 

the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie “hedged items” that would occur within the hedging period 

 

the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the 

value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  

 

september 27 2009 

 

 

 

equity security price risk 

 

the company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchangetraded funds within its trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the mdcp a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal 2009 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company utilizes shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 the company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the company’s debt in millions  

 

september 27 2009 

 

 

 

the company’s availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity as of september 27 2009 the company’s longterm availableforsale securities included ars please see note 3 for further information availableforsale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its availableforsale securities the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its availableforsale securities as of the end of fiscal 2009 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment stockbased compensation operating leases self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

 

asset impairment 

 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate carrying values exceed estimated fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company’s trademarks upon determination that the carrying values of such assets are in excess of their estimated fair values the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its longlived assets these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

starbucks accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions under which the company uses the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2009 would not have been material 

 

operating leases 

 

starbucks leases retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation “aro” expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated in addition the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 

 

self insurance reserves 

 

the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

 

starbucks recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and accrues for uncertain tax positions deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments including estimating the amount timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates

starbucks companyoperated retail stores accounted for 84 of total net revenues during fiscal 2008 

the following table summarizes total companyoperated retail store data for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

 

  

starbucks retail stores are typically located in hightraffic highvisibility locations because the company can vary the size and format its stores are located in or near a variety of settings including downtown and suburban retail centers office buildings and university campuses while the company selectively locates stores in shopping malls it focuses on locations that provide convenient access for both pedestrians and drivers the company also locates retail stores in select rural and offhighway locations to serve a broader array of customers outside major metropolitan markets to provide a greater degree of access and convenience for nonpedestrian customers the company has continued to expand development of drivethru retail stores at the end of fiscal 2008 the company operated approximately 2800 drivethru locations compared to approximately 2300 at the end of fiscal 2007 representing approximately 35 and 31 respectively of companyoperated stores in the us and canada combined

retail sales mix by product type for companyoperated stores was as follows 

 

 

 

specialty operations 

 

specialty operations strive to develop the company’s brands outside the companyoperated retail store environment through a number of channels starbucks strategy is to reach customers where they work travel shop and dine by establishing relationships with prominent third parties that share the company’s values and commitment to quality these relationships take various forms including licensing arrangements foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the company’s core businesses in certain situations starbucks has an equity ownership interest in licensee operations during fiscal 2008 specialty revenues which include royalties and fees from licensees as well as product sales derived from specialty operations accounted for 16 of total net revenues 

 

licensing — retail stores 

 

in its licensed retail store operations the company leverages the expertise of its local partners and shares starbucks operating and store development experience licensee partners provide improved and at times the only access to desirable retail space most licensees are prominent retailers with indepth market knowledge and access as part of these arrangements starbucks receives license fees and royalties and sells coffee tea and related products for resale in licensed locations employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow starbucks detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in companyoperated stores 

 

during fiscal 2008 438 starbucks licensed retail stores were opened in the united states and as of september 28 2008 the company’s us licensees operated 4329 stores during fiscal 2008 550 international licensed stores were opened at september 28 2008 the company’s international operating segment had a total of 3134 licensed retail stores product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from us and international licensed retail stores accounted for 48 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

at fiscal year end 2008 starbucks total licensed retail stores by region and specific location were as follows 

 

 

 

licensing — packaged coffee and tea 

 

through a licensing relationship with kraft foods inc “kraft” the company sells a selection of starbucks and seattle’s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo ® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the united states kraft manages all distribution marketing advertising and promotion of these products 

the company sells packaged coffee and tea internationally both directly to warehouse club customers such as costco and through a licensing relationship with kraft in canada and the uk 

 

by the end of fiscal 2008 the company’s coffees and teas were available in approximately 37000 grocery and warehouse club stores with 33000 in the united states and 4000 in international markets revenues from this category comprised 21 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

licensing — branded products 

 

the company licenses the rights to produce and market starbucks branded products through several partnerships both domestically and internationally significant licensing agreements include 

 

  

collectively the revenues from these branded products accounted for 4 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

foodservice 

 

the company sells whole bean and ground coffees including the starbucks and seattle’s best coffee brands as well as a selection of premium tazo ® teas and other related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry education healthcare office coffee distributors hotels restaurants airlines and other retailers the majority of the company’s direct accounts are through national broadline distribution networks with sysco corporation and us foodservice tm  starbucks foodservice sales customer service and support resources are aligned with those of sysco corporation and us foodservice 

 

the company’s total foodservice operations had over 19000 accounts primarily in the us at fiscal year end 2008 revenues from foodservice accounts comprised 25 of total specialty revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

product supply 

 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with its rigorous coffee standards starbucks controls its coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the distribution of coffee used in its operations the company purchases green coffee beans from coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends and single origin coffees 

 

the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by the company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

 

to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees in central america and to reinforce the company’s leadership role in the coffee industry starbucks operates the starbucks coffee agronomy company 

srl a wholly owned subsidiary located in costa rica staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts this firstofitskind farmer support center is designed to proactively respond to changes in coffee producing countries that impact farmers and the supply of green coffee during fiscal 2008 the company expanded this sustainability program to africa by establishing a farmer support center in rwanda 

 

the company buys coffee using fixedprice and pricetobefixed purchase commitments depending on market conditions to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee due to volatility in green coffee commodity prices the company has historically used fixedprice purchase contracts in order to bring greater certainty to its cost of sales in future periods and promote sustainability by paying an equitable price to coffee producers when green coffee commodity prices are high for sustained periods of time the company is less likely to enter into fixedprice contracts on favorable terms and more likely to increase the use of pricetobefixed contracts to meet its demand for coffee these types of contracts state the quality quantity and delivery periods and fix the price relative to a green coffee commodity benchmark but allow the benchmark price to be established after contract signing an increased use of pricetobefixed contracts instead of fixedprice contracts decreases the predictability of coffee costs in future periods until the price of green coffee becomes “fixed” by either starbucks or the seller 

 

during fiscal 2008 starbucks more than doubled its volume of pricetobefixed purchase commitments when compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of higher green coffee commodity prices during fiscal 2008 “c” coffee commodity prices traded on the new york board of trade within a price range of 118 to 167 per pound and prices were on average approximately 20 higher than fiscal 2007 and 25 higher than fiscal 2006 

 

as of september 28 2008 the company had 583 million of purchase commitments which together with existing inventory is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through calendar 2009 based on expected coffee delivery dates approximately 86 9 and 5 of these purchase commitments will be received by starbucks in fiscal years 2009 2010 and 2011 and later respectively additionally approximately 246 million of these purchase commitments are pricetobefixed contracts most of which will be received by starbucks during fiscal 2009 

 

the company depends upon its relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green coffee the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote 

 

in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores dairy expense for the us segment represents a large majority of the company’s total dairy expense therefore significant changes in us dairy prices can have a material impact on total dairy expense the us segment’s dairy costs which closely follow the monthly class i fluid milk base price as calculated by the us department of agriculture can change significantly in the short term the company’s us dairy costs remained higher throughout most of fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 adversely affecting the us segment’s and the company’s profitability in the united states the company purchases substantially all of its fluid milk requirements from three dairy suppliers the company believes based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of enough fluid milk to support its us retail business is remote 

 

the company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups lids cutlery napkins straws shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies to support the needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations the cost of these materials is dependent in part upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs but the company believes it mitigates the effect of shortterm raw material price fluctuations through strategic relationships with key suppliers 

 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas and the company’s selection of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty manufacturers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are generally purchased from both regional and local sources coffeemaking equipment such as drip and coffee press coffeemakers espresso machines and coffee grinders are generally purchased directly from their manufacturers 

coffeerelated accessories including items bearing the company’s logos and trademarks are produced and distributed through contracts with a number of different suppliers 

 

competition 

 

the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue the company believes that its customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience as well as price starbucks has been experiencing significantly greater direct competition from large competitors in the united states quickservice restaurant sector some of whom have substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than the company starbucks also faces wellestablished competitors in many international markets and increased competition in the us readytodrink coffee beverage market 

 

the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks specialty operations face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 

 

starbucks also faces intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

 

the company owns andor has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in many additional countries throughout the world rights to the trademarks and service marks in the united states are generally held by a wholly owned affiliate of the company and are used by the company under license some of the company’s trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo frappuccino seattle’s best coffee and tazo are of material importance to the company the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

 

the company owns numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials the company also holds patents on certain products systems and designs in addition the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” and “starbucksnet” 

 

research and development 

 

starbucks research and development efforts are led by the research and development department this team is responsible for the technical development of food and beverage products and new equipment the company spent approximately 72 million 70 million and 65 million during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of its business 

 

seasonality and quarterly results 

 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season the company’s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

employees 

 

the company employed approximately 176000 people worldwide as of september 28 2008 in the united states starbucks employed approximately 143000 people with 136000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s administrative and regional offices and store development roasting and warehousing operations approximately 33000 employees were employed outside of the united states with 32000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of the company’s employees represented by unions is immaterial starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

 

starbucks is including this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “act” for forwardlooking statements this 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act forwardlooking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they often include words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “estimates” “intends” “plans” “seeks” or words of similar meaning or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “should” “could” “may” “aims” “intends” or “projects” a forwardlooking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances and those future events or circumstances may not occur investors should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report these forwardlooking statements are all based on currently available operating financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the company’s actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below 

 

  

the company’s failure to meet market expectations going forward particularly with respect to comparable store sales net revenues operating margins and earnings per share will likely result in a decline in the market price of starbucks stock 

  

in fiscal 2008 the company undertook the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to drive longterm shareholder value and improve starbucks results of operations including 

 

  

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its new strategic initiatives or that its transformation plan will result in improved results of operations if the company does not successfully implement its new strategic initiatives or if its transformation plan does not achieve its intended results the company may experience a material adverse impact on its business and financial results

as the recent global financial crisis has broadened and intensified other sectors of the economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession now appears likely as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending the company will face an extremely challenging fiscal 2009 because starbucks customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses foreclosures bankruptcies reduced access to credit and sharply falling home prices any resulting decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction will negatively impact the company’s financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales deleveraging which creates downward pressure on margins additionally many of the effects and consequences of the global financial crisis and a broader global economic downturn are currently unknown any one or all of them could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity and capital resources including starbucks ability to issue commercial paper and to raise additional capital if needed the ability of banks to honor draws on starbucks credit facility or otherwise negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

 

  

the company’s financial performance is highly dependent on its united states operating segment which comprised 76 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2008 the company experienced a substantial downturn in traffic in its us stores in fiscal 2008 which adversely affected the operating results of the us segment and the company as a whole if the us segment is unable to improve its financial performance the company’s business and financial results will continue to be adversely affected 

 

  

in july 2008 the company announced several restructuring measures as part of the company’s multifaceted plan to transform its business and improve results of operations including a plan to close approximately 600 underperforming companyoperated stores in the us market a restructuring of the australia market and certain leadership and nonstore organization changes there can be no assurance that the company will fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from these restructuring measures the estimated costs and charges associated with the us store closures are based on management’s assumptions and projections and may vary materially based on various factors including the timing of store closures the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties the company’s ability to place affected partners employees into available positions at other starbucks stores and other changes in management’s assumptions and projections as a result of these events and circumstances delays and unexpected costs may occur which could result in the company not fully realizing the anticipated positive impact to the company’s future financial results from such us store closures further to the extent that the company is unable to improve its financial performance in fiscal 2009 further restructuring measures may be required in the future 

  

the company’s future growth will increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of its international operating segment some or all of the company’s international market business units “mbus” which starbucks generally defines by the countries or regions in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings the performance of the international operating segment may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the company’s large mbus additionally some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting the company’s us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in new international markets into which starbucks and its licensees expand may not embrace starbucks products to the same extent as consumers in the company’s existing markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the united states due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of the company’s international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations the company’s international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 

  

moreover many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing counties which are important to the company’s longterm growth prospects 

 

  

starbucks canada japan and uk markets account for a significant portion of the net revenues and profit contribution of the company’s international operating segment any significant decline in the financial performance of one of these key markets may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the entire starbucks international segment if not partially or fully offset by positive financial performance from the other two major markets 

  

a description of the general competitive conditions in which starbucks operates appears on page 7 under “competition” in the united states the continued focus by one or more large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages at a low cost has attracted starbucks customers and could if the numbers become large enough adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition from large competitors with significant resources in the united states packaged coffee and tea and readytodrink coffee beverage market could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment and the company’s results of operations given its premium brand starbucks may be impacted more severely than its competitors by customers trading down to lower priced coffee beverages and related products 

 

  

starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of its products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for its corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies management believes it must preserve and grow the value of the starbucks brand to be successful in the future particularly outside of north america where the starbucks brand is less wellknown brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for the company’s products and its brand equity could diminish significantly if starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its products is perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of its markets 

 

  

the company’s success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees and on its ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage starbucks stores starbucks must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality store employees could jeopardize the company’s ability to meet its financial targets 

 

  

the company’s business strategy including its plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of licensee and partnership relationships particularly in its international markets licensees are often authorized to use the starbucks logo and provide starbucksbranded beverages food and other products directly to customers the company provides training and support to and monitors the operations of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver to starbucks customers may be diminished by any number of factors beyond the company’s control management believes customers expect the same quality of products and service from the company’s licensees as they do from starbucks and the company strives to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food may be attributed by customers to starbucks thus damaging the company’s reputation and brand value and potentially affecting the results of operations 

 

  

effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly as starbucks expands into new markets internationally where it must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management with 

consistency with the company’s goals philosophy and standards significant growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet the company’s financial targets to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 

  

some starbucks products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects there has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles combined with excessive consumption of highcalorie foods have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity particularly in the united states there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increasing publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while starbucks has a variety of healthy choice beverage and food items including items that are low in caffeine and calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in the company’s products or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity could significantly reduce the demand for the company’s beverages and food products 

 

similarly instances or reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses and food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could in the future affect the company as well any report linking starbucks to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering could damage its brand value immediately and severely hurt sales of its beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims clean water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee beverages the company’s ability to ensure a clean water supply to its stores is limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses the company could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect starbucks sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of the company’s stores could materially harm the company’s business and results of operations 

 

  

a health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity the company’s business could be severely affected starbucks has positioned itself as a third place between home and work where people can gather together for human connection customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic and local regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores the impact of a health pandemic on starbucks might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

 

  

as of september 28 2008 starbucks had approximately 51 billion in minimum future rental payments under noncancelable operating leases and 32 billion of total liabilities on a consolidated basis included in total liabilities are aggregate principal indebtedness of 713 million under outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings and 550 million under tenyear notes maturing in august 2017 future increases in the company’s 

level of financial obligations if any would have several important effects on the company’s future operations such as 

 

  

the company’s ability to satisfy its lease obligations and make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness depends on its future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting its consolidated operations many of which are beyond the company’s control if starbucks is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy its financial obligations it may be required among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable starbucks to satisfy its financial obligations in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 

 

an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in starbucks credit ratings a reduction in its credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit the company’s availability of additional financing and increase its cost of obtaining financing 

 

  

starbucks relies heavily on information technology systems across its operations including for management of its supply chain pointofsale processing in its stores and various other processes and transactions the company’s ability to effectively manage its business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of its products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of the company’s operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

 

  

starbucks policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including those imposed by the sec nasdaq and foreign countries as well as applicable labor laws additional legal and regulatory requirements such as those arising under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which the company operates and the related cost of compliance failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in damage to starbucks reputation civil and criminal liability fines and penalties increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of the company’s financial statements

management overview 

 

fiscal 2008 — the year in review 

 

throughout fiscal 2008 starbucks continued to experience declining comparable store sales in its us stores primarily due to lower customer traffic with the us segment representing 76 of consolidated revenues the impact of this decline on the company’s financial results for fiscal 2008 was significant for fiscal year 2008 comparable store sales declined 5 in the us with a declining trend over the course of the year ending with a decline of 8 in the fourth quarter the company also experienced declining comparable sales in canada and the uk its two largest companyoperated international markets primarily due to lower traffic the company believes that the weaker traffic has been caused by a number of ongoing factors in the global economies that have negatively impacted consumers’ discretionary spending as well as factors within the company’s control with respect to the pace of store openings in the us and store level execution in the us the economic factors included the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food rising levels of unemployment and personal debt reduced access to consumer credit and lower home values as well as increased foreclosure activity in certain areas of the country california and florida where starbucks has a high concentration of companyoperated stores these developments combined with recent and ongoing unprecedented shocks to the global financial system and capital markets have all contributed to sharp declines in consumer confidence in the us 

 

starbucks business is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in customer traffic increased customer visits create sales leverage meaning that fixed expenses such as occupancy costs are spread across a greater revenue base thereby improving operating margins but the reverse is also true — sales deleveraging creates downward pressure on margins the softness in us revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and us segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales 

 

since january 2008 when company founder howard schultz reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman starbucks has taken steps to address the deterioration in the us retail environment and address its global support structure these included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to reinvigorate the starbucks experience for the company’s customers increase customer traffic in its us stores reduce infrastructure expenses and improve the company’s results of operations these significant actions have been designed to structure the company’s business for longterm profitable growth 

 

as a result of the continued weak economy and decreased customer traffic as well as the costs associated with the store closures and other actions in its transformation strategy the company’s fiscal 2008 results were negatively impacted in the following ways

the more significant actions taken by starbucks in fiscal 2008 to transform and reinvigorate its business included 

 

  

fiscal 2009 — the view ahead 

 

management expects the company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal 2009 both in the us and internationally including in its two largest companyoperated markets of canada and the uk as the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending the company expects to face an extremely challenging fiscal 2009 because of these economic conditions accordingly starbucks expects to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal 2009 additionally the company’s earnings for fiscal 2009 will be impacted by lease termination and severance costs from the us and australia store closures totaling up to an estimated 012 of eps for fiscal 2009 the company estimates that the combination of the us and australia store closures and head count reductions will result in a pretax benefit to operating income of approximately 200 million to 210 million in fiscal 2009 which equates to approximately 017 to 018 of eps 

 

starbucks plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings in both companyoperated and licensed markets and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the global economy starbucks fiscal 2009 us store opening target is approximately a negative 20 net new stores which includes a nearly 225 companyoperated store decline and approximately 205 net new licensed stores internationally starbucks is planning to open approximately 700 net new stores in fiscal 2009 twothirds of which are expected to be licensed as it factors in the current global economic climate with a more cautious approach in the uk and western europe 

 

operating segment overview 

 

starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states international and cpg 

 

the united states and international segments both include companyoperated retail stores licensed retail stores and foodservice operations licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than companyoperated stores under the licensed model starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus companyoperated compared to the us segment however the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the more mature us segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the international segment average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels further certain market costs particularly occupancy costs are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment which comprises a more diverse group of operations as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment the number of stores the higher unit volumes and the lower market costs the us segment despite its higher relative percentage of companyoperated stores has a higher operating margin excluding restructuring costs than the lessdeveloped international segment 

the company’s international store base continues to increase and starbucks has been achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china brazil and russia the company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 

 

the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea as well as branded products operations worldwide the cpg segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners most significantly the north american coffee partnership with the pepsicola company for distribution of readytodrink beverages and with kraft foods inc for distribution of packaged coffees and teas this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way most of the customer revenues from the readytodrink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner not by the cpg segment and the proportionate share of the results of the company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings as a result the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the company’s other two reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores 

 

expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses related depreciation and amortization expenses restructuring charges and amounts included in “interest income and other net” and “interest expense” on the consolidated statements of earnings

results of operations — fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

consolidated results of operations in millions 

 

 

 

net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both companyoperated retail revenues and specialty operations 

 

during fiscal 2008 starbucks derived 84 of total net revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months offset by negative 3 comparable store sales for the same period revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008 the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5 for the year partially offsetting this was 2 comparable store sales growth in the international segment within fiscal 2008 consolidated quarterly revenue 

growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the us 

 

the company derived the remaining 16 of total net revenues from channels outside the companyoperated retail stores collectively known as specialty operations licensing revenues which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery warehouse club and certain other brandedproduct operations increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months the increase in foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the us foodservice business 

 

for fiscal 2009 the company expects total revenues to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2008 with variations driven by the level of comparable store sales 

 

 

 

 

  

as discussed in the management overview section above many of the company’s operating expenses are fixed in nature as a result the softness in us revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and us segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales and pressured operating margins 

 

cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the us business primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payrollrelated expenses restructuring charges include asset impairment lease exit and severance costs these costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the us and australia and the rationalization of the company’s leadership structure and nonstore organization see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues in addition restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40 of the decrease 

 

 

 

interest income and other net decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the company’s trading securities portfolio as described in more detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under its management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance with this offsetting impact recorded in “general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statements of earnings interest expense increased due to the company’s issuance of 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes in august of fiscal 2007 

 

income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 313 compared to 363 for fiscal 2007 the lower rate is due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the us 

 

operating segments 

 

segment information is prepared on the same basis that the company’s management reviews financial information for operational decisionmaking purposes starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states international and cpg “unallocated corporate” includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments operating income represents earnings before “interest income and other net” “interest expense” and “income taxes” the following tables summarize the company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2008 and 2007  in millions

companyoperated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 445 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months partially offset by a 5 decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2008 the us companyoperated retail business continued to experience deteriorating trends in transactions during the year driven by the us economic slowdown 

 

licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 438 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts 

 

 

 

 

  

operating margin contracted significantly primarily due to restructuring charges incurred and to softer revenues due to weak traffic as well as higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues restructuring charges of 2109 million had a 270 basis point impact on the operating margin the increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales higher payrollrelated expenditures and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments 

 

international 

 

the international operating segment sells coffee and other beverages complementary food whole bean coffees and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through companyoperated retail stores in canada the uk and nine other markets specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly forty other countries and foodservice accounts primarily in canada and japan the company’s international store base continues to increase and starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels many of the company’s international operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income than in the united states this continuing investment is part of the company’s longterm balanced plan for profitable growth 

 

 

 

companyoperated retail revenues increased due to the opening of 236 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months favorable foreign currency exchange rates primarily on the canadian dollar and comparable store sales growth of 2 for fiscal 2008 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 companyoperated retail revenues grew at a slower rate yearoveryear of 12 and comparable store sales were flat compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2007 both driven by slowdowns in the uk and canada due to the weakening global economy 

 

specialty revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 550 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months 

 

 

 

 

  

operating margin decreased primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs driven by continued expansion of lunch and warming programs in canada higher distribution costs and higher building maintenance expense due to store renovation activities in addition restructuring charges of 192 million recognized in fiscal 2008 had a 90 basis point impact on the operating margin nearly all due to the closure of 61 companyoperated stores in australia 

 

global consumer products group 

 

the cpg operating segment sells a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium tazo ® teas through licensing arrangements in united states and international markets cpg also produces and sells a variety of readytodrink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements 

 

 

total net revenues increased primarily due to higher royalties and product sales in the international readytodrink business and increased sales of us packaged tea and international club packaged coffee 

 

 

 

growth of operating margin was primarily due to lower cost of sales as a percentage of related revenues partially offset by lower income from equity investees lower cost of sales was primarily due to a sales mix shift to more profitable products 

 

unallocated corporate 

 

unallocated corporate expenses pertain to corporate administrative functions that support but are not specifically attributable to the company’s operating segments 

 

 

 

total unallocated corporate expenses remained relatively flat due to lower payrollrelated expenditures which were offset by restructuring charges incurred for corporate office facilities that were no longer occupied by the company due to the reduction in positions within starbucks leadership structure and nonstore organization

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues decreased primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007 other operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007 depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 1342 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenditures in support of continued global growth offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006 income from equity investees increased primarily due to higher equity income from international investees

following the company’s announcement on july 1 2008 that it planned to close approximately 600 underperforming us companyoperated stores and reduce new store growth in fiscal year 2009 standard  poor’s placed the bbb longterm rating and a2 short term ratings for starbucks on creditwatch with negative implications on july 3 2008 moody’s placed the baa1 senior unsecured rating for starbucks on review for possible downgrade however moody’s reaffirmed the company’s prime2 shortterm rating for commercial paper standard and poor’s and moody’s subsequently downgraded the longterm ratings as of september 4 2008 and november 17 2008 respectively 

 

credit rating agencies currently rate the company’s borrowings as follows 

 

 

 

  

factors that may affect credit ratings include changes in the company’s operating performance the economic environment and the company’s capital structure in order to maintain its credit ratings there is an expectation that the company will modestly reduce its leverage during fiscal 2009 the company expects to improve its leverage ratio below a certain target level primarily through the reduction in short term borrowings credit rating downgrades can adversely impact among other things future borrowing costs access to capital markets and future operating lease terms if either of the company’s shortterm ratings were downgraded it would likely make the issuance of commercial paper difficult in these circumstances the company could draw upon its credit facility 

 

in normal market conditions it is generally more favorable for the company to issue commercial paper rather than borrow against the credit facility however as described in item 1a risk factors the ongoing global financial crisis may result in conditions where commercial paper is not available at reasonable rates in such situations the company is more likely to draw on its credit facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company borrowed against the credit facility as liquidity conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated as of september 28 2008 borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled 300 million 

the company’s credit facility contains provisions requiring starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of september 28 2008 and september 30 2007 the company was in compliance with each of these covenants on october 31 2008 the company entered into an amendment to the credit facility to exclude up to 130 million of lease termination expenses and lease exit costs incurred during the period beginning on june 30 2008 and ending september 27 2009 from the agreement’s “operating lease and rental expense” definition the purpose of the amendment was to limit the shortterm effects of leaserelated restructuring expenses from the company’s store closure actions on the fixed charge coverage ratio these expenses would have otherwise put pressure on the coverage ratio and raised the risk of the company losing access to liquidity over the long term the reduction in lease expense and improvement in operating cash flows resulting from these store closures are expected to have a favorable effect on this coverage ratio the amendment also increased the cost to borrow under the facility by an additional 010 to 040 depending on the company’s fixed charge ratio and its senior unsecured debt rating 

 

the 550 million of 10year 625 senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 also require starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties as of september 28 2008 and september 30 2007 the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

the company expects to use its cash and liquid investments including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in its core businesses including new beverage innovations as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses the company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the company’s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent 

 

depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program due to the current challenging operating and economic environment the company continues to be conservative in its uses of cash and did not repurchase any shares in the second third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2008 management also does not currently anticipate any share repurchases in fiscal 2009 management believes that cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and liquid investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and severance costs from the us and australia store closures as a result the company expects to decrease shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2009 significant new joint ventures acquisitions andor other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 

 

other than normal operating expenses cash requirements for fiscal 2009 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new companyoperated retail stores remodeling and refurbishment of existing companyoperated retail stores and new equipment to support enhanced quality standards and expanded offerings in the stores other capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 are expected to consist principally of investments in information technology systems and in the company’s global supply chain operations total expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be approximately 700 million 

 

cash provided by operating activities decreased by 725 million to 13 billion for fiscal 2008 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 the modest decrease was primarily due to the slowing pace of store construction which led to a decline in the balance in accounts payable yearoveryear 

 

cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled 11 billion net capital additions to property plant and equipment used 9845 million primarily from opening new companyoperated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores during fiscal 2008 in addition the sale and maturity of availableforsale securities provided 759 million and 200 million respectively for fiscal 2008 consisting primarily of auction rate securities and agency notes the auction rate securities were sold through the normal auction process prior to the auction failures that began in midfebruary 2008 as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and the agency notes issued by governmentsponsored enterprises were called in the first half of fiscal 2008 

 

cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled 1845 million cash used to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock totaled 3114 million all in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 this amount includes the 

effect of the net change in unsettled trades from september 30 2007 of 161 million net repayments of commercial paper were 2972 million and net borrowings under short term borrowings were 2994 million for fiscal 2008 as of september 28 2008 a total of 7132 million in borrowings were outstanding under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility as well as 159 million in letters of credit which were outstanding under the credit facility leaving 2709 million of capacity available under the 1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of 1123 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the company’s common stock from employee stock purchase plans as options granted are exercised starbucks will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction but the amount and the timing of these cash flows cannot be reliably predicted as option holders’ decisions to exercise options will be largely driven by movements in the company’s stock price 

 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 28 2008 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in millions  

 

 

 

 

  

starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility 

 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

 

commodity price risk represents the company’s primary market risk generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products the company purchases roasts and sells highquality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations for additional details see product supply in item 1 as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10k 

financial risk management 

 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and interest rates the company manages its exposure to various marketbased risks according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk additionally this policy restricts among other things the amount of marketbased risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity in general hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

 

the sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

 

commodity price risk 

 

the company purchases commodity inputs including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results in addition to fixedpriced contracts and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases the company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges as of the end of fiscal 2008 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

the majority of the company’s revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of the company’s operations consists of activities outside of the united states the company has transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

 

as of september 28 2008 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan as well as the company’s net investments in its canada uk and china subsidiaries to minimize foreign currency exposure 

 

the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie “hedged items” that would occur within the hedging period 

 

the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions  

 

september 28 2008 

 

 

equity security price risk 

 

the company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the mdcp a corresponding liability is included in “accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “interest income and other net” in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in “general and administrative expenses” the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal 2008 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company utilizes shortterm and longterm financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 the company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 

 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the company’s debt  in millions  

 

september 28 2008 

 

 

 

the company’s availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its availableforsale securities the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its availableforsale securities as of the end of fiscal 2008 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

 

starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment stockbased compensation operating leases self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

 

asset impairment 

 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company’s trademarks upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations judgments made by the company related to 

the expected useful lives of longlived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its longlived assets these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

starbucks accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” the company uses the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2008 would not have been material 

 

operating leases 

 

starbucks leases retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation “aro” expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated in addition the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent starbucks accounts for lease contract termination costs in accordance with sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 

 

self insurance reserves 

 

the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

 

income taxes 

 

starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities accruals for uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments including estimating the amount timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates

product supply 

 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with its rigorous coffee standards starbucks controls its coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the distribution of coffee used in its operations the company purchases green coffee beans from coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends and single origin coffees 

 

the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by the company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

 

the company depends upon its relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green coffee due to volatility in green coffee commodity prices the company has predominantly used fixedprice purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee bring greater certainty to its cost of sales in future periods and promote sustainability by paying an equitable price to coffee producers as of september 30 2007 the company had 324 million in fixedprice purchase commitments which together with existing inventory is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2008 the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote during fiscal 2007 “c” coffee commodity prices traded on the new york board of trade within a price range of 100 to 135 per pound and prices were on average approximately 10 higher than in fiscal 2006 in september 2007 prices moved sharply higher as poor weather led to decreased expectations for the next harvest in the world’s largest arabica coffee producer brazil based on its market experience the company believes that fixedprice purchase commitments are less likely to be available on favorable terms when commodity prices are high if prices were to continue to move higher during fiscal 2008 starbucks likely would increase the use of pricetobefixed purchase contracts to meet its demand for coffee these types of contracts state the quality quantity and delivery periods but allow the price of green coffee over a market index to be established after contract signing the company believes that through a combination of fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts it will be able to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee however an increased use of pricetobefixed contracts instead of fixedprice contracts would decrease the predictability of coffee costs in future periods by volume approximately 20 of the company’s coffee purchase agreements entered during fiscal 2007 were pricetobefixed contracts 

 

during fiscal 2004 starbucks established the starbucks coffee agronomy company srl a wholly owned subsidiary located in costa rica to reinforce the company’s leadership role in the coffee industry and to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees from central america staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts this firstofitskind farmer support center is designed to proactively respond to changes in coffee producing countries that impact farmers and the supply of green coffee during fiscal 2007 the company announced plans to conduct similar activities in east africa 

 

in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products particularly fluid milk to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores dairy expense for the us segment represents approximately 75 of the company’s total dairy expense therefore significant changes in us dairy prices can have a material impact on total dairy expense the us segment’s dairy costs which closely follow the monthly class i fluid milk base price as calculated by the us department of agriculture can change significantly in the short term the company’s us dairy costs rose materially in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and costs accelerated in the 

fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and have remained high adversely affecting the us segment’s and the company’s profitability in the united states the company purchases substantially all of its fluid milk requirements from two dairy suppliers the company believes based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of enough fluid milk to support its us retail business is remote 

 

the company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups lids cutlery napkins straws shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies to support the needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations the cost of these materials is dependent in part upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs but the company believes it mitigates the effect of shortterm raw material price fluctuations through strategic relationships with key suppliers 

 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas and the company’s selection of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty manufacturers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries breakfast sandwiches and lunch items are generally purchased from both regional and local sources coffeemaking equipment such as drip and coffee press coffeemakers espresso machines and coffee grinders are generally purchased directly from their manufacturers coffeerelated accessories including items bearing the company’s logos and trademarks are produced and distributed through contracts with a number of different suppliers 

 

competition 

 

the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quickservice restaurants and specialty coffee shops in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue the company believes that its customers choose among retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience and to a lesser extent on price starbucks has recently experienced significantly greater direct competition from large competitors in the united states quickservice restaurant sector some of whom have substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than the company starbucks also faces wellestablished competitors in many international markets and increased competition in the us readytodrink coffee beverage market 

 

the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks specialty operations face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 

 

starbucks faces intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 

 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

 

the company owns andor has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in many additional countries throughout the world rights to the trademarks and service marks in the united states are generally held by a wholly owned affiliate of the company and are used by the company under license some of the company’s trademarks including starbucks the starbucks logo frappuccino seattle’s best coffee and tazo are of material importance to the company the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

 

the company owns numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials the company also holds patents on certain products systems and designs in addition the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” and “starbucksnet” 

research and development 

 

starbucks research and development efforts are led by food scientists engineers chemists and culinarians in the research and development department this team is responsible for the technical development of food and beverage products and new equipment the company spent approximately 70 million 65 million and 62 million during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of its business 

 

seasonality and quarterly results 

 

starbucks business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season the company’s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

 

employees 

 

the company employed approximately 172000 people worldwide as of september 30 2007 in the united states starbucks employed approximately 144000 people with 136000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s administrative and regional offices and store development roasting and warehousing operations approximately 28000 employees were employed outside of the united states with 27000 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations the number of the company’s employees represented by unions is immaterial starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they often include words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “estimates” “intends” “plans” “seeks” or words of similar meaning or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “should” “could” or “may” a forwardlooking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances and those future events or circumstances may not occur investors should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report starbucks is under no obligation 

to update or alter any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise these forwardlooking statements are all based on currently available operating financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the company’s actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below the risks below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and risks that management currently considers immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company 

 

  

management believes the price of starbucks stock reflects high market expectations for the company’s future operating results any failure to meet those expectations particularly for the growth rates for i comparable store sales attributable to number of transactions average value per transaction or both ii net revenues iii earnings per share or iv net new store openings could cause the market price of starbucks stock to drop rapidly and sharply

the company’s financial performance is highly dependent on its united states operating segment which comprised 78 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2007 any substantial or sustained decline in these operations if not offset by increased financial performance elsewhere could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

 

  

a description of the general competitive conditions in which starbucks operates appears on page 6 under “competition” in the united states the continued focus by one or more large competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector on selling highquality specialty coffee beverages at a low cost could attract starbucks customers and adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations similarly continued competition from wellestablished competitors in international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect the company’s sales and results of operations in those markets increased competition from large competitors with significant resources in the united states readytodrink coffee beverage market could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment and the company’s results of operations 

 

  

starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of its products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for its corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies management believes it must preserve and grow the value of the starbucks brand to be successful in the future particularly outside of north america where the starbucks brand is less wellknown brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of subjective qualities even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for the company’s products and its brand equity could diminish significantly if starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its products is perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of its markets 

 

  

the company’s future growth will increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of its international operating segment some or all of the company’s international market business units “mbus” which starbucks generally defines by the countries or regions in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenues and earnings some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting the company’s us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in new international markets into which starbucks and its licensees expand may not embrace starbucks products to the same extent as consumers in the company’s existing markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the united states due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of the company’s international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations the company’s international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as

starbucks expects the people’s republic of china to be its largest market outside of the united states the company’s growing investments in its china operations will increase the company’s exposure in this market any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations might adversely affect the company’s china business 

 

many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the business conducted by starbucks by restricting the scope of the company’s foreign investments within china and the food and beverage retail wholesale and distribution business conducted within china although management believes it has structured the company’s china operations to comply with local laws there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if china’s governmental authorities were ultimately to conclude that starbucks has not complied with one or more existing or future laws or regulations or if their interpretations of those laws or regulations were to change over time the company’s affiliates could be subject to fines and other financial penalties prohibited from opening new stores or forced to cease operations entirely moreover any inability of the company to enforce its intellectual property and contract rights in china’s courts could adversely affect the company’s business 

 

additionally starbucks plans to continue entering selected markets in other developing countries and has recently entered russia as an important part of the projected growth of the international operating segment some of those markets pose legal and business challenges similar to the china market such as substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 

 

  

the company’s growth strategy including its plans for new stores foodservice branded products and other initiatives relies significantly on a variety of licensee and partnership relationships particularly in its international markets licensees are often authorized to use the starbucks logo and provide starbucksbranded beverages food and other products directly to customers the company provides training and support to and monitors the operations of these business partners but the product quality and service they deliver to starbucks customers may be diminished by any number of factors beyond the company’s control management believes customers expect the same quality of products and service from the company’s licensees as they do from starbucks and the company strives to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a companyoperated or licensed store any shortcoming of a starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food may be attributed by customers to starbucks thus damaging the company’s reputation and brand value and potentially affecting the results of operations 

  

the company’s longterm goal is to open approximately 20000 starbucks stores in the united states and at least 20000 stores in international markets starbucks expects to double the size of its business over the next four to five years and achieve higher annual growth in net earnings than revenue effectively managing growth on this scale is challenging particularly as starbucks expands into new markets internationally where it must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management with consistency with the company’s goals philosophy and standards growth on this scale makes it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet the company’s growth targets to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience 

 

  

the company’s future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees starbucks future growth also depends substantially on its ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage starbucks stores starbucks must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality store employees could jeopardize the company’s ability to meet its growth targets 

 

  

some starbucks products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects there has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles combined with excessive consumption of highcalorie foods have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity particularly in the united states there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increasing publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while starbucks has a variety of beverage and food items that are low in caffeine and calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in the company’s products or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity could significantly reduce the demand for the company’s beverages and food products 

 

similarly reports whether true or not of unclean water supply foodborne illnesses and food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing grocery and quickservice restaurant sectors and could in the future affect the company as well any report linking starbucks to the use of unclean water foodborne illnesses or food tampering could damage its brand value immediately and severely hurt sales of its beverages and food products and possibly lead to product liability claims clean water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee beverages the company’s ability to ensure a clean water supply to its stores is limited particularly in some international locations if customers become ill from foodborne illnesses the company could also be forced to temporarily close some stores in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry adversely affect starbucks sales on a regional or global basis a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a temporary closure of any of the company’s stores could materially harm the company’s business and results of operations 

  

a discussion of the sources and availability of coffee of the quality sought by starbucks and fluid milk appears on page 5 under “product supply” any significant increase in the market price or any significant decrease in the availability of highquality arabica coffee or fluid milk could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

 

  

a health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity the company’s business could be severely affected starbucks has positioned itself as a third place between home and work where people can gather together for human connection customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic and local regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores the impact of a health pandemic on starbucks might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

 

  

starbucks relies heavily on information technology systems across its operations including for management of its supply chain pointofsale processing in its stores and various other processes and transactions the company’s ability to effectively manage its business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of its products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of the company’s operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

 

  

starbucks management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions and ii providing reasonable assurance that the company a records transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements b makes receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the company would prevent or detect a misstatement of the company’s financial statements or fraud the company’s rapid growth and entry into new globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in starbucks and a sharp decline in the market price of its common stock 

  

as of september 30 2007 starbucks had approximately 50 billion in minimum future rental payments under noncancelable operating leases and 31 billion of total liabilities on a consolidated basis included in total liabilities are aggregate principal indebtedness of 710 million under outstanding commercial paper and 550 million under tenyear notes issued in an august 2007 underwritten registered public offering the company will incur additional operating lease obligations largely driven by new store openings and may incur additional indebtedness subject to the limitations contained in its financing agreements the recent increase in the company’s level of financial obligations has had and any future increase which may or may not occur will have several important effects on the company’s future operations such as 

 

  

the company’s ability to satisfy its lease obligations and make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness depends on its future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting its consolidated operations many of which are beyond the company’s control if starbucks is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy its financial obligations it may be required among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable starbucks to satisfy its financial obligations in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 

 

the company’s existing strong cash flow and capital structure mitigate the current risk associated with leverage management expects future cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses debt service costs and capital expenditures required to support projected new store openings and investments in existing and new markets in addition management does not expect to increase leverage to levels that would inhibit the company’s access to capital markets in the event of shortfalls in anticipated operating cash flow

management overview 

 

fiscal 2007 — the year in review 

 

starbucks achieved solid performance in fiscal 2007 — meeting its targets for store openings revenue growth comparable store sales growth and earnings per share — despite a challenging economic and operating environment and significant cost increases from dairy the company completed the fiscal year with encouraging trends and momentum in its international business but faced increasing challenges in its us business while us comparable store sales were within the company’s stated target range it was accomplished through two price increases which offset flattonegative transaction count trends in the us business the pressure on traffic is consistent with similar trends reported across both the retail and restaurant industry management believes that the combination of the economic slowdown and the price increases implemented in fiscal 2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressures have impacted the frequency of customer visits to starbucks stores 

 

consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased 21 to 94 billion companyoperated retail revenues in fiscal 2007 rose 21 to 80 billion predominantly due to the opening of 1342 stores and comparable store sales growth of 5 the increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4 increase in the average value per transaction and 1 growth in the number of customer transactions the company opened a total of 2571 new companyoperated and licensed stores during the year with 70 in the us and 30 in international markets to end the year with over 15000 stores 

 

for fiscal 2007 operating income increased to 11 billion while operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 112 of total net revenues margin compression was due to higher costs of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs rent expense and dairy costs these cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses store operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues 

 

net earnings rose to 673 million in fiscal 2007 from 564 million for the previous year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 increased to 087 compared to 071 a year ago excluding the cumulative effect of adopting fin 47 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006 earnings grew 16 and diluted earnings per share increased 19 

 

fiscal 2008 — the view ahead 

 

throughout fiscal 2007 starbucks experienced a consistent weakening in its us business exiting the year with a negative trend in transactions management recognizes that it faces a more challenging environment from an economic operational and competitive standpoint entering fiscal 2008 in response to those challenges management intends to focus in the following key areas 

 

 20 

 

in setting targets for fiscal 2008 management’s goal was to balance the longterm opportunity for store growth with the nearterm realities of the challenging economic and operating environment for fiscal 2008 the company is targeting 

 

  

in summary management believes these targets are balanced for fiscal 2008 the company intends to continue to build out stores to take advantage of its global opportunity to better execute in its us business to grow and deliver significant margin expansion in its international business and to deliver margin improvement for the company on a consolidated basis 

 

operating segment overview 

 

starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states international and cpg 

 

the united states and international segments both include companyoperated retail stores licensed retail stores and foodservice operations the united states segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of and attachment to the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base as a result the united states segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the international segment average sales per store are also higher in the united states due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels further certain market costs particularly occupancy costs are lower in the united states segment compared to the average for the international segment which comprises a more diverse group of operations as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the united states segment the number of stores the higher unit volumes and the lower market costs the united states segment has a higher operating margin than the lessdeveloped international segment 

 

the company’s international store base continues to increase rapidly and starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets such as china brazil and russia the company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 

 

the cpg segment includes the company’s grocery and warehouse club business as well as branded products operations worldwide the cpg segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners most significantly the north american coffee partnership with the pepsicola company for distribution of readytodrink beverages and with kraft foods inc for distribution of packaged coffees and teas this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way most of the customer revenues from the readytodrink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner not by the cpg segment and the proportionate share of the results of the company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings as a result the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin compared to the company’s other two reporting segments which consist primarily of retail stores 

 

expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses related depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in “net interest and other income” on the consolidated statements of earnings

during the fiscal year ended 2007 starbucks derived 85 of total net revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased 21 to 80 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 66 billion for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1342 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5 for the fiscal year ended 2007 the increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4 increase in the average value per transaction and a 1 increase in the number of customer transactions 

 

the company derived the remaining 15 of total net revenues from channels outside the companyoperated retail stores collectively known as specialty operations specialty revenues which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues increased 17 to 14 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 12 billion for fiscal 2006 

 

licensing revenues which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery warehouse club and certain other brandedproduct operations increased 19 to 10 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 861 million for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20 increase in licensing revenues from the company’s cpg business 

 

foodservice and other revenues increased 13 to 387 million for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 343 million for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to growth in new and existing accounts in the us foodservice business 

 

cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 425 of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 408 for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products the rise in distribution costs higher rent expense and higher dairy costs dairy expense for the us segment represents approximately 75 of the total company’s dairy expense for the us segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 resulting in approximately 20 million of additional expense 

 

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues decreased to 402 for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 408 for fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007 

 

other operating expenses expenses associated with the company’s specialty operations decreased to 208 of total specialty revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 211 in fiscal 2006 the decline resulted primarily from controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007 

 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 467 million for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 387 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to the opening of 1342 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months as a percentage of total net revenues depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 49 for the fiscal 2007 compared to 50 for fiscal 2006 

 

general and administrative expenses increased to 489 million for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 479 million for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenditures in support of continued global growth offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006 as a percentage of total net revenues general and administrative expenses decreased to 52 for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 61 for fiscal 2006 

 

income from equity investees increased 15 to 108 million for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 94 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher equity income from international investees 

 

operating income increased 18 to 11 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 894 million for fiscal 2006 operating margin decreased to 112 of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007 from 115 for fiscal 2006 margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs rent expense and dairy costs 

these cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses store operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues 

 

net interest and other income was 2 million for the fiscal year ended 2007 compared to 12 million for fiscal 2006 the decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from a higher level of borrowings outstanding which include the 550 million of senior notes issued in august 2007 offset in part by a higher amount of income recognized on unredeemed stored value card and gift certificate balances in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2007 resulted in an effective tax rate of 363 compared to 358 for fiscal 2006 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2007 with quarterly variations

cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 408 of total net revenues for fiscal 2006 from 409 in fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities these favorable items combined with lower dairy costs offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006 

 

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased to 408 for fiscal 2006 from 402 for fiscal 2005 the increase was due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of new accounting requirements to expense stockbased compensation at the beginning of its fiscal first quarter of 2006 under the transition provisions allowed it adopted the new requirements on a prospective basis and the financial statements for fiscal 2005 and prior years do not include stockbased compensation expense

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the primary sources of the company’s liquidity are cash flows generated from retail store operations and other business channels borrowings under available commercial paper programs and credit agreements proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt securities and the company’s existing cash and liquid investments which were 460 million and 459 million as of september 30 2007 and october 1 2006 respectively 

 

components of the company’s most liquid assets are as follows in thousands  

 

 

 

in order to hedge its liability under its management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” the company maintains a portfolio of unrestricted trading securities the value of which was 74 million as of september 30 2007 in addition unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the company’s wholly owned captive insurance company to fund claim payouts totaled approximately 98 million as of september 30 2007 the company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled payments on shortterm borrowings 

 

in determining the appropriate capital structure for the company management considers among other things how debt may reduce its total cost of capital when used to fund increased distributions to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases the company also evaluates its degree of cash flow risk and how much financial flexibility should be retained for future investment opportunities given its high growth rate the company’s key metrics for monitoring its capital structure are leverage measured as the ratio of debt to ebitda and coverage measured as the ratio of ebitda to interest expense including rent expense both ratios are adjusted to capitalize operating leases the credit rating agencies moody’s and standard  poor’s currently rate the company’s commercial paper p2 and a2 respectively and its longterm debt baa1 and bbb respectively

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

the company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yendenominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee starbucks coffee japan ltd “starbucks japan” the guarantees continue until the loans including accrued interest and fees have been paid in full with the final loan amount due in 2014 the maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts as well as other related expenses these amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate as of september 30 2007 the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately 49 million since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the company’s adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet 

 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

 

commodity price risk represents the company’s primary market risk generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products the company purchases roasts and sells high quality whole bean coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations for additional details see “product supply” in item 1 as well as “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

financial risk management 

 

market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and interest rates the company manages its exposure to various marketbased risks according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions the umbrella risk management policy governs the 

hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk additionally this policy restricts among other things the amount of marketbased risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity in general hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

 

the sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited pointintime view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 

 

commodity price risk 

 

the company purchases commodity inputs including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results in addition to fixedpriced contracts and pricetobefixed contracts for coffee purchases the company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges as of the end of fiscal 2007 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

the majority of the company’s revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of the company’s operations consists of activities outside of the united states the company has transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues inventory purchases assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

 

as of september 30 2007 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted to hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases in addition starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan as well as the company’s net investments in its canadian uk and chinese subsidiaries to minimize foreign currency exposure these contracts expire within 30 months 

 

the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie “hedged items” that would occur within the hedging period 

 

the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income “oci” from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items  in millions

equity security price risk 

 

the company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the mdcp a corresponding liability is included in “accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are 

recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “net interest and other income” in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in “general and administrative expenses” the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal 2007 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company utilizes short and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006 the company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007 the company had treasury interest rate contracts in place to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the 550 million senior notes issued in august 2007 these contracts were dedesignated and settled at closing of the debt offering 

 

the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the company’s debt  in millions  

 

september 30 2007 

 

 

 

the company’s availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its availableforsale securities the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its availableforsale securities as of the end of fiscal 2007 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

seasonality and quarterly results 

 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season the company’s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season since revenues from the starbucks card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences for these reasons results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

 

starbucks considers its policies on impairment of longlived assets stockbased compensation operating leases self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company’s trademarks upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations property plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level longlived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its longlived assets these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

starbucks accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” the company uses the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2007 would not have been material 

 

operating leases 

 

starbucks leases retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation “aro” expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated in addition the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 

 

self insurance reserves 

 

the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

 

income taxes 

 

starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement 

carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets and contingent tax liabilities provided for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in certain tax positions although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and the company will adopt the new requirements in its first fiscal quarter of 2008 the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption the company expects that the effect of adopting fin 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal year 2008 opening retained earnings 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009 starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements if any upon adoption of sfas 157 or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009 

 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” the intent of sab 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors sab 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance sheet approach sab 108 was effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 and the company adopted the new requirements in fiscal 2007 with no impact to its consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value sfas 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 or starbucks first fiscal quarter of 2009 early adoption is permitted starbucks has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the provisions of sfas 159 or what the effect of adoption of the statement would have if any on its consolidated financial statements

collectively the operations of these other initiatives accounted for 2 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006 

 

product supply 

 

starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with its rigorous coffee standards starbucks controls its coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the distribution of coffee used in its operations 

 

the company purchases green coffee beans from coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends and single origin coffees 

 

the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market coffee of the quality sought by the company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies 

 

the company depends upon its relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green coffee with green coffee commodity prices at relatively low levels in recent years the company has used fixedprice purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee bring greater certainty to the cost of sales in future periods and promote sustainability by paying a fair price to coffee producers as of october 1 2006 the company had 546 million in fixedprice purchase commitments which together with existing inventory is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2007 the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is remote during the first few months of fiscal 2006 green coffee commodity prices increased moderately since then commodity prices have stabilized but still remain above the historically low levels experienced in recent years based on its market experience the company believes that fixedprice purchase commitments are less likely to be available on favorable terms when commodity prices are high if prices were to move higher during fiscal 2007 starbucks would likely return to its previous practice of entering into pricetobefixed purchase contracts to meet a large part of its demand these types of contracts state the quality quantity and delivery periods but allow the price of green coffee over a market index to be established after contract signing the company believes that through a combination of fixedprice and pricetobefixed contracts it will be able to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee however an increased use of pricetobefixed contracts instead of fixedprice contracts would decrease the predictability of coffee costs in future periods 

 

during fiscal 2004 starbucks established the starbucks coffee agronomy company srl a wholly owned subsidiary located in costa rica to reinforce the company’s leadership role in the coffee industry and to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees from central america staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts this firstofitskind farmer support center is designed to proactively respond to changes in coffee producing countries that impact farmers and the supply of green coffee 

 

in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores dairy prices in the united states which closely follow the monthly class i fluid milk base price as calculated by the us department of agriculture rose in both fiscal 2004 and 2005 then declined in 2006 should prices rise significantly in the future starbucks profitability could be adversely affected in the united states the company purchases substantially all of its fluid milk requirements from two dairy suppliers the company believes based on relationships established with these suppliers that the risk of nondelivery of enough fluid milk to support its us retail business is remote 

 

 

the company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups lids napkins straws shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies to support the needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations the cost of these materials is dependent in part upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs but the company believes it mitigates the effect of shortterm raw material price fluctuations through strategic relationships with key suppliers in the united states the company is contractually required to purchase all of its cups lids straws and cutlery from a single supplier any material interruption in the supply of these products to the company if not offset by sufficient purchases from other suppliers could materially adversely affect the company’s supply chain and its ability to serve its us retail customers the company believes based on its relationship with this supplier that the risk of nondelivery of enough of these products to support its us retail business is remote 

 

products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas and the company’s menu of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty manufacturers usually under longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries and lunch items are generally purchased from both regional and local sources coffeemaking equipment such as drip and french press coffeemakers espresso machines and coffee grinders are generally purchased directly from their manufacturers coffeerelated accessories including items bearing the company’s logos and trademarks are produced and distributed through contracts with a number of different suppliers 

 

competition 

 

the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are restaurants specialty coffee shops and doughnut shops in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue although competition in the beverage market is currently fragmented competition is increasing particularly from competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector who are focusing on growing the specialty coffee part of their business a major competitor with substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than the company could enter this market at any time and compete directly against starbucks 

 

the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market the company believes that its customers choose among retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience and to a lesser extent on price 

 

starbucks believes that supermarkets are the most competitive distribution channel for specialty whole bean coffee in part because supermarkets offer customers a variety of choices without having to make a separate trip to a specialty coffee store a number of coffee manufacturers are distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets regional specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in supermarkets 

 

in addition to the competition generated by supermarket sales of coffee starbucks competes for whole bean coffee sales with franchise operators and independent specialty coffee stores in virtually every major metropolitan area where starbucks operates and expects to expand there are local or regional competitors with substantial market presence in the specialty coffee business starbucks specialty operations also face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 

 

starbucks faces intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores there can be no assurance that starbucks will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel 

 

patents trademarks copyrights and domain names 

 

the company owns andor has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in nearly 180 additional countries throughout the world rights to the trademarks and service marks in the united 

 

 

states are generally held by a wholly owned affiliate of the company and are used by the company under license some of the company’s trademarks including starbucks ®  the starbucks logo frappuccino ®  seattle’s best coffee ® and tazo ® are of material importance to the company the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

 

the company owns numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging promotional materials instore graphics and training materials the company also holds patents on certain products systems and designs in addition the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names including “starbuckscom” and “starbucksnet” 

 

research and development 

 

starbucks research and development efforts are led by food scientists engineers chemists and culinarians in the research and development department this team is responsible for the technical development of food and beverage products and new equipment the company spent approximately 65 million 62 million and 47 million during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of its business 

 

seasonality and quarterly results 

 

starbucks business is subject to seasonal fluctuations significant portions of the company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the fiscal year which includes the holiday season in addition quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences because of the seasonality of the business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

 

employees 

 

as of october 1 2006 the company employed approximately 145800 people worldwide in the united states starbucks employed approximately 123600 people with 116100 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s administrative and regional offices and store development roasting and warehousing operations approximately 22200 employees were employed in international with 21200 in companyoperated retail stores and the remainder in the company’s regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations at fiscal year end employees at nine of the company’s canadian stores were represented by a union starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are good

• a regional or global health pandemic could severely affect starbucks business 

 

a health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur depending upon its duration and severity the company’s business could be severely affected starbucks has positioned itself as a “third place” between home and work where people can gather together for human connection customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic and local regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease a regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores the impact of a health pandemic on starbucks might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale use or license of their products and services 

 

• market expectations for starbucks financial performance are high 

 

management believes the price of starbucks stock reflects high market expectations for its future operating results in particular any failure to meet the market’s high expectations for starbucks comparable store sales growth rates earnings per share and new store openings could cause the market price of starbucks stock to drop rapidly and sharply 

 

  

  

 

 

  

• the company’s success depends substantially on the value of the starbucks brand 

 

starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of its products for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for its corporate social responsibility programs the starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies management believes it must preserve and grow the value of the starbucks brand to be successful in the future particularly outside of north america where the starbucks brand is less well known brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of subjective qualities and can be damaged badly even by isolated business incidents that degrade consumer trust particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation consumer demand for the company’s products and its brand equity could diminish significantly if 

 

 

starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its products is perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of its markets 

 

• starbucks is highly dependent on the financial performance of its united states operating segment 

 

the company’s financial performance is highly dependent on its united states operating segment which comprised 79 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2006 any substantial or sustained decline in these operations if not offset by increased financial performance elsewhere could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

 

• starbucks is increasingly dependent on the success of its international operating segment in order to achieve its growth targets 

 

the company’s future growth depends increasingly on the growth and operations of its international operating segment some or all of the company’s international market business units “mbus” which starbucks generally defines by the countries or regions in which they operate may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth starbucks may find business partners who do not share its cultural marketing or operating philosophies or who are unable to operate the mbu profitably some factors that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting the company’s us stores and licensees tastes naturally vary by region and consumers in new international markets into which starbucks and its licensees expand may not embrace starbucks products to the same extent as consumers in the company’s existing markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher internationally than in the united states due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with countryspecific regulatory requirements because many of the company’s international operations are in an early phase of development operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to us operations the company’s international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad such as 

 

  

  

starbucks expects the people’s republic of china to be its largest market outside of the united states any significant or prolonged deterioration in uschina relations might adversely affect the company’s china business the company’s growing investments in its china operations will increase the company’s exposure in this market 

 

 

many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government china’s government regulates the business conducted by starbucks through its subsidiaries joint ventures and authorized licensees by restricting the scope of the company’s foreign investments within china and the food and beverage retail wholesale and distribution business conducted within china although management believes it has structured the company’s china operations to comply with local laws there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china if china’s governmental authorities were ultimately to conclude that starbucks has not complied with one or more existing or future laws or regulations or if their interpretations of those laws or regulations were to change over time the company’s affiliates could be subject to fines and other financial penalties or forced to cease operations entirely moreover it could adversely affect the company’s business if it is unable to enforce its intellectual property and contract rights in china’s courts 

 

additionally starbucks plans to enter selected markets in other developing countries such as russia and india as an important part of the projected growth of the international operating segment some of those markets pose legal and business challenges similar to the china market such as substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 

 

• effectively managing the company’s rapid growth is challenging 

 

the company’s longterm goal is to open approximately 20000 starbucks stores in the united states and at least 20000 stores in international markets starbucks expects annual total net revenue growth of approximately 20 and annual earnings per share growth of approximately 2025 for the next three to five year period effectively managing growth on this scale is challenging particularly as starbucks expands into new markets internationally and it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw materials to hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet the company’s growth targets to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience achieving the company’s growth targets is also dependent on its ability to open more new stores in the current year as well as future years than it opened in prior years 

 

  

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executive and operating officers and other personnel starbucks must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage or loss of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to meet its growth targets 

 

• starbucks faces intense competition in the specialty coffee market 

 

there are numerous competitors in almost every market in which starbucks operates and in which it expects to expand in both the specialty coffee beverage business and the specialty whole bean coffee business this is especially true in the major metropolitan areas where starbucks operates and expects to expand in virtually all of which there are local or regional competitors with substantial collective market presence although competition in the specialty coffee beverage market is currently fragmented competition is increasing particularly from competitors in the quickservice restaurant sector who are focusing on growing the specialty coffee beverage part of their businesses a major competitor with substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than starbucks could enter this market at any time and compete directly against starbucks the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores some of the company’s competitors in these whole bean specialty coffee distribution channels have greater financial and marketing resources than starbucks both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market starbucks also faces wellestablished competitors in many international markets if starbucks fails to maintain 

 

 

and build market share in the specialty coffee market and the coffee market generally it could harm the company’s business and financial results 

 

• adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming the company’s products could harm its business 

 

some of the company’s products contain caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects there has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles combined with excessive consumption of highcalorie foods have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity particularly in the united states there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity due in part to increasing publicity and attention from health organizations as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while starbucks has a variety of beverage and food items that are low in caffeine and calories an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in the company’s products or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity could significantly reduce the demand for the company’s beverages and food products 

 

  

the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market highaltitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies any significant increase in the market price or any significant decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results starbucks also purchases large quantities of dairy products — particularly milk any significant increase in the market price or decrease in availability of dairy products could harm the company’s business and financial results 

 

• failure of the company’s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 

 

the management of starbucks is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s rapid growth and entry into new globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

during the fiscal year ended october 1 2006 the company’s focus on execution in all areas of its business from us and international companyoperated retail operations to the company’s specialty businesses delivered strong financial performance management believes that its ability to achieve the balance between growing the core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing longterm shareholder value starbucks fiscal 2006 performance reflects the company’s continuing commitment to achieving this balance 

 

the primary driver of the company’s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores both companyoperated and licensed in pursuit of the company’s objective to establish starbucks as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world starbucks opened 2199 new stores in fiscal 2006 and plans to open approximately 2400 in fiscal 2007 with a presence in 37 countries serving customers more than 40 million times per week management 

 

 

continues to believe that the company’s longterm goal of approximately 20000 starbucks retail locations throughout the united states and at least 20000 stores in international markets is achievable 

 

in addition to opening new retail stores starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing companyoperated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers the strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service introducing innovative products and improving speed with service through training technology and process improvement 

 

global comparable store sales for companyoperated markets increased by 7 making fiscal 2006 the 15th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of 5 or greater comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of 3 to 7 

 

in licensed retail operations starbucks shares operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores internationally the company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop in january 2006 the company increased its equity ownership from 5 to 100 in its operations in hawaii and puerto rico and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2006 purchased a 90 stake in its previouslylicensed operations in beijing china 

 

the combination of more retail stores comparable store sales growth of 7 and growth in other business channels in the us international and cpg operating segments resulted in a 22 increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the company expects revenue growth of approximately 20 in fiscal 2007 consistent with its three to five year revenue growth target 

 

operating income as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 115 in fiscal 2006 from 123 in fiscal 2005 due to the recognition of stockbased compensation net earnings increased by 14 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reported operating margin and net earnings include the effects of stockbased compensation in fiscal 2006 while stockbased compensation expense was not included in the company’s consolidated financial results in fiscal 2005 

 

acquisitions

consolidated results of operations 

 

net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22 to 78 billion from 64 billion for fiscal 2005 driven by increases in both companyoperated retail revenues and specialty operations net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

during the fiscal year ended 2006 starbucks derived 85 of total net revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased 22 to 66 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006 from 54 billion for fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to the opening of 1040 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7 in fiscal 2006 the increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5 increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2 increase in the average value per transaction management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by sustained popularity of core products new product innovation and a high level of customer satisfaction

licensing revenues which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery warehouse club and certain other branded product operations increased 28 to 861 million for fiscal 2006 from 673 million for fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1159 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and to a lesser extent growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business 

 

foodservice and other revenues increased 13 to 343 million for fiscal 2006 from 304 million for fiscal 2005 foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing us foodservice accounts 

 

cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 408 of total net revenues for fiscal 2006 from 409 in fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities these favorable items combined with lower dairy costs offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006 

 

store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased to 408 for fiscal 2006 from 402 for fiscal 2005 the increase was due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation 

 

other operating expenses which are expenses associated with the company’s specialty operations increased to 216 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 202 in fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense as well as higher payrollrelated expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations both in the us and in existing and new international markets 

 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 387 million in fiscal 2006 from 340 million in fiscal 2005 the increase of 47 million was due to the opening of 1040 new companyoperated retail stores in the last 12 months as a percentage of total net revenues depreciation and amortization decreased to 50 for fiscal 2006 from 53 for fiscal 2005 

 

general and administrative expenses increased to 473 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 357 million in fiscal 2005 the increase was due to higher payrollrelated expenditures from the recognition of stockbased compensation expense additional employees to support continued global growth and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development as a percentage of total net revenues general and administrative expenses increased to 61 for fiscal 2006 from 56 for fiscal 2005 

 

income from equity investees increased to 94 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 77 million in fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due to favorable volumedriven operating results for the north american coffee partnership which produces readytodrink beverages which include among others bottled frappuccino ® coffee drinks and starbucks doubleshot ® espresso drinks as well as improved operating results from international investees including korea and japan mainly as a result of new store openings 

 

operating income increased 15 to 894 million in fiscal 2006 from 781 million in fiscal 2005 the operating margin decreased to 115 of total net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 123 in fiscal 2005 due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense 

 

net interest and other income which primarily consists of interest income decreased to 12 million in fiscal 2006 from 16 million in fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the company’s revolving credit facility as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances offset in part by the recognition of 44 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006 there was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005 

 

income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 358 compared to 379 in fiscal 2005 the decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005 

 

 

the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multiyear income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the company had established a contingent liability and to increased effectiveness of the company’s longterm tax planning strategies the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is expected to be approximately 38 with quarterly variations

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of october 1 2006 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods  in thousands  

 

 

 

  

starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business as well as ongoing borrowings under the facility 

 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

the company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yendenominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee starbucks coffee japan ltd “starbucks japan” the guarantees continue until the loans including accrued interest and fees have been paid in full with the final loan amount 

 

 

due in 2014 the maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts as well as other related expenses these amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate as of october 1 2006 the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately 60 million since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the company’s adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indebtedness of others” starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its balance sheet 

 

product warranties 

 

coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through companyoperated and licensed retail stores as well as equipment sold to the company’s licensees for use in retail licensing operations are under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to 24 months effective fiscal 2006 the company elected to discontinue repairing brewing machines and instead offer an exchange to customers as a general right of return for any of its products as a result starbucks maintains a sales return allowance based on historical patterns to reduce related revenues for estimated future product returns prior to fiscal 2006 the company established an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale also based on historical experience product warranty costs and changes to the related accrual were not significant for the periods ended october 1 2006 and october 2 2005 

 

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions 

 

the company manages its exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy marketbased risks including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies such as entering into hedging transactions additionally this policy restricts among other things the amount of marketbased risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 

 

the company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations for additional details see “product supply” in item 1 as well as “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and changes in interest rates 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

the majority of the company’s revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however because a portion of the company’s operations consists of activities outside of the united states the company has transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound sterling euro and japanese yen under the company’s umbrella risk management policy the company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations as a result starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments with maturities generally not exceeding five years to hedge assets liabilities revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies 

 

as of october 1 2006 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases in addition starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan an equity method investment as well as the company’s net investments in its canadian and uk subsidiaries these contracts expire within 33 months 

 

 

based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of october 1 2006 a 10 devaluation of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of october 1 2006 would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately 44 million of which 22 million may reduce the company’s future earnings conversely a 10 appreciation of the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately 38 million of which 20 million may increase the company’s future earnings consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts increases or decreases in their fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the company’s foreign investment future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period 

 

equity security price risk 

 

the company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” a corresponding liability is included in “accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “interest and other income net” in the consolidated statements of earnings the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in “general and administrative expenses” 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company’s availableforsale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its availableforsale securities the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments including its shortterm borrowings and longterm debt as of the end of fiscal 2006 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

 

seasonality and quarterly results 

 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations significant portions of the company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year which includes the holiday season in addition quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences because of the seasonality of the company’s business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

 

starbucks considers its policies on impairment of longlived assets accounting for self insurance reserves stockbased compensation and accounting for operating leases to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company’s trademarks upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations property plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level longlived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its longlived assets these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

starbucks accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r the company uses the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 

 

operating leases 

 

starbucks leases retail stores roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation “aro” expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated in addition the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 

 

self insurance reserves 

 

the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation healthcare benefits general liability property insurance director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities portions of which are calculated by third party actuarial firms could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting 

 

 

and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and the company will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008 the cumulative effects if any of adopting fin 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption the company has not yet determined the impact if any of adopting fin 48 on its consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009 starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements if any upon adoption of sfas 157 or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009 

 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” the intent of sab 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors sab 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and a cumulative balance sheet approach sab 108 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2006 and the company will adopt the new requirements in fiscal 2008 the adoption of sab 108 is not currently expected to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

investees equity method investments and identifiable assets by segment is included in note 20 of the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 to this report product supply starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages to ensure compliance with its rigorous coffee standards starbucks controls its coffee purchasing roasting and packaging and the distribution of coffee to its retail stores the company purchases green coffee beans from coffeeproducing regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends and single origin coffees the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market coffee of the quality sought by the company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies the company depends upon its relationships with coffee producers outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green coffee following several years of depressed prices green coffee prices in most of the world markets have been trending higher in recent years in an effort to encourage the continuing supply of high quality coffee and provide a certain degree of price stability for green coffee purchases the company negotiates contracts directly with its suppliers and has been successful in securing annual contracts for the majority of its coffee requirements on this basis the company routinely enters into fixedprice purchase commitments for future deliveries of coffee as of october 3 2004 the company had 2717 million in fixedprice purchase commitments which together with existing inventory are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee for calendar 2005 the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers in the past the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is low during fiscal 2004 starbucks established the starbucks coffee agronomy company srl a wholly owned subsidiary located in costa rica to reinforce the company’s leadership role in the coffee industry and to help ensure sustainability and future supply of highquality green coffees from central america staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts this firstofitskind farmer support center will be able to among other things proactively respond to changes in coffee producing countries that impact farmers and the supply of green coffee there can be no assurance that these activities will successfully protect the company against the risks of higher coffee prices or that such activities will not result in the company having to pay substantially more for its coffee supply than it would have been required to pay absent such activities in addition to coffee the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its companyoperated retail stores fluid milk is purchased from multiple suppliers who have processing facilities near concentrations of 7 

companyoperated retail stores dairy prices in the united states which closely follow the monthly class i fluid milk base price as calculated by the us department of agriculture reached an alltime high during fiscal 2004 while management monitors published dairy prices on the related commodities markets management cannot predict with any certainty future prices to be paid for dairy products the company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic products such as cups lids napkins straws shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies to support the needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations the cost of these materials is somewhat dependent upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs but the company believes it mitigates the effect of shortterm raw material price fluctuations through strategic relationships with key suppliers products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of different channels beverage ingredients other than coffee and milk including leaf teas and the company’s menu of readytodrink beverages are purchased from several specialty manufacturers usually pursuant to longterm supply contracts food products such as fresh pastries and lunch items are generally purchased from both regional and local sources coffeemaking equipment such as drip and french press coffeemakers espresso machines and coffee grinders are generally purchased directly from their manufacturers coffeerelated accessories including items bearing the company’s logos and trademarks are produced and distributed through contracts with a number of different suppliers competition the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are restaurants specialty coffee shops and doughnut shops in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue although competition in the beverage market is currently fragmented a major competitor with substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than the company could enter this market at any time and compete directly against starbucks the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market the company believes that its customers choose among retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience and to a lesser extent on price starbucks believes that supermarkets are the most competitive distribution channel for specialty whole bean coffee in part because supermarkets offer customers a variety of choices without having to make a separate trip to a specialty coffee store a number of coffee manufacturers are distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets that may serve as substitutes for the company’s coffees regional specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in supermarkets in addition to the competition generated by supermarket sales of coffee starbucks competes for whole bean coffee sales with franchise operators and independent specialty coffee stores in virtually every major metropolitan area where starbucks operates and expects to expand there are local or regional competitors with substantial market presence in the specialty coffee

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general starbucks corporation’s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30 the fiscal year ended on october 3 2004 included 53 weeks with the 53 rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter fiscal years 2003 and 2002 each had 52 weeks fiscal year 2005 will have 52 weeks restatement of financial statements on february 7 2005 the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating leaserelated accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” in light of this letter the company’s management initiated a review of its lease accounting and determined that its thencurrent method of accounting for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances and its thencurrent method of accounting for rent holidays were not in accordance with gaap as a result the company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended october 3 2004 september 28 2003 and september 29 2002 in this report the company had historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvement asset on the consolidated balance sheets and capital expenditures in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows management determined that financial accounting standards board “fasb” technical bulletin no 881 “issues relating to accounting for leases” requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows additionally this adjustment results in a reclassification of the deferred rent amortization from “depreciation and amortization expenses” to “cost of sales including occupancy costs” on the consolidated statements of earnings the company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straightline basis over the lease term commencing with the initial occupancy date or the opening date for companyoperated retail stores the store opening date coincided with the commencement of business operations which corresponds to the intended use of the property management reevaluated fasb technical bulletin no 853 “accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases” and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes which is generally two months prior to a store opening date excluding tax impacts the correction of this accounting requires the company to record additional deferred rent in “accrued occupancy costs” and “other longterm liabilities” and to adjust “retained earnings” on the consolidated balance sheets as well as to correct amortization in “costs of sales including occupancy costs” on the consolidated statements of earnings for each of the three years in the period ended october 3 2004 the cumulative effect of these accounting changes is a reduction to retained earnings of 86 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and decreases to retained earnings of 13 million 15 million and 12 million for the fiscal years ended 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of october 3 2004 and september 28 2003 as well as on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections management overview during the fiscal year ended october 3 2004 all areas of starbucks business from us and international companyoperated 15 

retail operations to the company’s specialty businesses delivered strong financial performance and innovation was prevalent throughout the company’s operations starbucks believes the company’s ability to achieve the balance between growing the core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing shareholder value starbucks fiscal 2004 performance provides a strong example of the company’s commitment to achieve this balance historically the primary driver of the company’s revenue growth has been the opening of new retail stores both companyoperated and licensed in pursuit of the company’s objective to establish starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world with a presence today in more than 30 countries management believes that the company’s longterm goal of operating 15000 starbucks retail locations throughout the united states and at least 15000 stores in international markets is achievable in addition to opening new retail stores starbucks is targeting to increase revenues generated at new and existing companyoperated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers the strategy is to increase first year average store sales and comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service maintaining a steady stream of product innovation and improving the speed of service through training technology and process improvement for us companyoperated stores opened in fiscal 2004 first year sales volumes are currently estimated at greater than 800000 as a result of these efforts comparable store sales for companyoperated markets increased by 10 making fiscal 2004 the 13 th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of 5 or greater in licensed retail operations starbucks shares operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores which generate additional royalty income and product sales the company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake as international markets develop the combination of more retail stores higher revenues from existing stores and growth in other business channels in both the united states and international operating segments resulted in a 299 increase in total net revenues for the 53 weeks of fiscal 2004 compared to the 52 weeks of fiscal 2003 excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004 total net revenues increased 273 both of these revenue growth measures were above the company’s three to five year target of approximately 20 since additional retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities the company’s infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement in fiscal 2004 operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 115 from 104 in fiscal 2003 and net earnings increased by 464 compared to fiscal 2003 these results demonstrated the company’s ability to improve operating margin despite pressures from rising dairy and green coffee commodity costs throughout the fiscal year the company’s international operations delivered a full year of positive operating results primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base in recent fiscal years the company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel as well as established more efficient distribution networks such investments were necessary to support the company’s planned international expansion which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation management believes that comparable store sales growth of the level achieved during fiscal 2004 is not sustainable over the long term however management believes that new store development opportunities on a global basis are sufficient for the company to maintain a high level of unit growth and that the execution of the current retail operating strategy can continue to increase first year average store sales and comparable stores sales these revenue growth opportunities coupled with continuous focus on controlling both operating and capital costs should allow starbucks to continue to modestly improve margins and achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 20 and annual earnings per share growth of 2025 for the next three to five years acquisitions in july 2004 starbucks acquired 100 of its licensed operations in singapore and acquired 499 of its licensed operations in malaysia for a combined total of approximately 121 million previously the company did not have any equity ownership interests in these entities the results of operations for singapore are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition for its investment in malaysia management applied the equity method of accounting from the date of acquisition since the company is able to exert significant influence over the investee’s operating and financial policies in july 2003 the company acquired seattle coffee company “scc” which includes the seattle’s best coffee ® and torrefazione italia ® brands from afc enterprises inc for 70 million in cash the results of operations of scc are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 16 

during fiscal 2003 starbucks increased its equity ownership to 50 of its international licensed operations in austria shanghai spain switzerland and taiwan which enabled the company to exert significant influence over their operating and financial policies for these operations the company reflected a change in accounting method during fiscal 2003 from the cost method to the equity method in the consolidated financial statements results of operations — fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total net revenues unless otherwise indicated of certain items included in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings as restated  

 consolidated results of operations net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 299 to 53 billion from 41 billion for the 52week period of fiscal 2003 net revenues increased 273 when calculated on a comparative 52week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 during the fiscal year ended 2004 starbucks derived 84 of total net revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased 292 to 45 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004 from 34 billion for the 52week period of fiscal 2003 companyoperated retail revenues increased 267 when calculated on a comparative 52week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 this increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new companyoperated retail stores during the previous 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10 the increase in comparable store sales was due to a 9 increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1 increase in the average value per transaction comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004 management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation continued popularity of core products a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology training and execution at retail stores the company derived the remaining 16 of total net revenues from its specialty operations specialty revenues which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues increased 337 to 837 million for the fiscal year ended 2004 from 626 million for the 52week period of fiscal 2003 excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004 total specialty revenues increased 310 to 820 million licensing revenues which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements grocery and warehouse club licensing and certain other brandedproduct licensed operations increased 382 to 566 million for the fiscal year ended 2004 from 410 million for the 52week period of fiscal 2003 the increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the addition of 710 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses the growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses was a result of expanded agreements with kraft foods inc including the addition of six new starbucks coffees along with a selection of tazo ® teas and the acquisition of seattle coffee company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 17 

foodservice and other revenues increased 253 to 271 million for the fiscal year ended 2004 from 216 million for the 52week period of fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing foodservice accounts which benefited from the july 2003 acquisition of seattle coffee company cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 414 of total net revenues in fiscal 2004 from 413 in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs partially offset by leverage gained on occupancy costs which are primarily fixed expenses store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased to 402 in fiscal 2004 from 400 in fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher marketing expenditures for holiday and new product promotions as well as increased costs to maintain retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels other operating expenses expenses associated with the company’s specialty operations decreased to 205 of specialty revenues in fiscal 2004 compared to 226 in fiscal 2003 the decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payrollrelated expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 289 million in fiscal 2004 from 245 million in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to a net increase of 634 new companyoperated retail stores during the previous 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the company’s foodservice operations as a percentage of total net revenues depreciation and amortization decreased to 55 for the 53 weeks ended october 3 2004 from 60 for the corresponding 52week fiscal 2003 period primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004 general and administrative expenses increased to 304 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 245 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenditures as a percentage of total net revenues general and administrative expenses decreased to 57 for the 53 weeks ended october 3 2004 from 60 for the 52 weeks ended september 28 2003 operating income increased 440 to 608 million in fiscal 2004 from 422 million in fiscal 2003 the operating margin increased to 115 of total net revenues in fiscal 2004 compared to 104 in fiscal 2003 primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed operating costs distributed over an expanded revenue base partially offset by higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs income from equity investees was 61 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 38 million in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to volumedriven operating results for the north american coffee partnership which produces bottled frappuccino ® and starbucks doubleshot ® coffee drinks and improved profitability of starbucks coffee japan ltd “starbucks japan” the july 2003 increase in the company’s ownership interest from 5 to 50 in the taiwan and shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth net interest and other income which primarily consists of interest income increased to 14 million in fiscal 2004 from 12 million in fiscal 2003 the growth was a result of interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances during fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year income taxes for the 53 weeks ended october 3 2004 resulted in an effective tax rate of 372 compared to 385 in fiscal 2003 the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer nondeductible losses were generated from international markets which are in various phases of development 18

revenues from its companyoperated retail stores companyoperated retail revenues increased 235 to 34 billion for the fiscal year ended 2003 from 28 20

brandedproduct licensed operations increased 313 to 4096 million for the fiscal year ended 2003 from 3119 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period the increase was due to higher product sales

175 to 2163 million for the fiscal year ended 2003 from 1841 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period the increase was primarily attributable to broader distribution and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 413 of total net revenues in fiscal 2003 from 410 in fiscal 2002 the increase was primarily due to higher green coffee costs and a shift in specialty revenue mix to lower margin products the company’s green coffee costs reached a historic low for starbucks in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2002 and have gradually increased since then these increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base store operating expenses as a percentage of companyoperated retail revenues increased to 400 in fiscal 2003 from 397 in fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher payrollrelated and advertising expenditures payrollrelated costs have increased

as discussed above income from equity investees was 384 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 334 million in fiscal 2002 the increase was mainly attributable to continued strong results by the north american coffee partnership the company’s 50owned partnership with the pepsicola company from expanded readytodrink product lines lower direct costs and manufacturing efficiencies partially offsetting this increase was the company’s proportionate share of the net losses of starbucks japan in fiscal 2003 compared to a net profit in fiscal 2002 primarily due to lower average sales per store net interest and other income which primarily consists of interest income increased to 116 million in fiscal 2003 from 93 million in fiscal 2002 the growth was a result of increased interest received on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and liquid securities during fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year as well as gains realized on market revaluations of the company’s trading securities compared to realized losses on this portfolio in the prior year 21 

the company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 385 compared to 373 in fiscal 2002 as a result of a shift in the composition of the company’s pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 operations taxed in the united states had higher pretax earnings and international operations generated greater nondeductible losses during fiscal 2003 than fiscal 2002 22

commodity prices availability and general risk conditions the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility although most coffee trades in the commodity market coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather political and economic conditions in addition green coffee prices have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have 25 

historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide the company’s ability to raise sales prices in response to rising coffee prices may be limited and the company’s profitability could be adversely affected if coffee prices were to rise substantially the company enters into fixedprice purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee and bring greater certainty to the cost of sales in future periods as of october 3 2004 the company had 2717 million in fixedprice purchase commitments which together with existing inventory is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through calendar 2005 the company believes based on relationships established with its suppliers in the past the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is low during fiscal 2004 fluid milk prices in the united states which closely follow the monthly class i fluid milk base price as calculated by the us department of agriculture reached an alltime high should dairy costs remain at current levels or continue to rise the company’s profitability could be adversely affected while management continues to monitor published dairy prices on the related commodities markets management cannot predict with any certainty the future prices to be paid for dairy products in addition to fluctuating commodity prices management believes that the company’s future results of operations and earnings could be significantly impacted by other factors such as increased competition within the specialty coffee industry the company’s ability to find optimal store locations at favorable lease rates increased costs associated with opening and operating retail stores and the company’s continued ability to hire train and retain qualified personnel as well as other factors discussed under “certain additional risks and uncertainties” in the “business” section of the company’s annual report on form 10ka for the fiscal year ended october 3 2004 financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates equity security prices and changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company’s revenue expense and capital purchasing activities is transacted in us dollars however because a portion of the company’s operations consists of activities outside of the united states the company has transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian dollar british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as part of its risk management strategy the company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations as a result starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments with maturities generally not exceeding five years to hedge assets liabilities revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies as of october 3 2004 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases in addition starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as a hedge of its net investment in starbucks japan these contracts expire within 31 months based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of october 3 2004 a 10 devaluation of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of october 3 2004 would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately 207 million of which 140 million may reduce the company’s future net earnings conversely a 10 appreciation of the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately 181 million of which 126 million may increase the company’s future net earnings consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts increases or decreases in the fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the company’s foreign investment future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period equity security price risk the company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio the trading securities approximate a portion of the company’s liability under the management deferred compensation plan “mdcp” a corresponding liability is included in “accrued compensation and related costs” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “interest and other income net” the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in “general and administrative expenses” on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 26 

interest rate risk the company’s diversified availableforsale portfolios consist mainly of fixed income instruments the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity availableforsale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss” the company does not hedge its interest rate exposure the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments held at the end of fiscal 2004 and determined that such a change would not have a material effect on the fair value of these instruments seasonality and quarterly results the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations significant portions of the company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year which includes the december holiday season in addition quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences because of the seasonality of the company’s business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions starbucks considers its policies on impairment of longlived assets to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements impairment of longlived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company’s trademarks upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations property plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level longlived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its longlived assets these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges new accounting standards in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 46 revised “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of arb no 51” “fin 46r” which provided among other things immediate deferral of the application of fin 46 for entities that did not originally qualify as special purpose entities and provided additional scope exceptions for joint ventures with business operations and franchises the company’s adoption of fin 46r did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements in december 2003 the issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” rescinded the accounting guidance contained in sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” and incorporated the body of previously issued guidance related to multipleelement revenue arrangements the company’s adoption of sab 104 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements in march 2004 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 031” but delayed the

competition   the company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are restaurants coffee shops and street carts in almost all markets in which the company does business there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business and management expects this situation to continue although competition in the beverage market is currently fragmented a major competitor with substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than the company could enter this market at any time and compete directly against the company   the company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against specialty coffees sold at retail through supermarkets specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee stores both the company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market the company believes that its customers choose among retailers primarily on the basis of product quality service and convenience and to a lesser extent on price   management believes that supermarkets are the most competitive distribution channel for specialty whole bean coffee in part because supermarkets offer customers a variety of choices without having to make a separate trip to a specialty coffee store a number of nationwide coffee manufacturers are distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets that may serve as substitutes for the company’s coffees regional specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in supermarkets   in addition to the competition generated by supermarket sales of coffee starbucks competes for whole bean coffee sales with franchise operators and independent specialty coffee stores in virtually every major metropolitan area where starbucks operates and expects to expand there are local or regional competitors with substantial market presence in the specialty coffee business starbucks specialty operations also face significant competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than the company   in addition the company faces intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores there can be no assurance that starbucks will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified workers patents trademarks copyrights and domain names   the company owns andor

approximately 36 million during fiscal 2002 on technical research and development activities in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of the company’s business seasonality and quarterly results   the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations significant portions of the company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year that includes the december holiday season in addition quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences because of the seasonality of the company’s business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year employees   as of september 29 2002 the company employed approximately 62000 people approximately 57000 in retail stores and the remainder in the company’s regional offices and administrative specialty store development roasting and warehousing operations at fiscal year end employees at 10 of the company’s stores and a group of 11 maintenance mechanics and technicians at one

number of nationwide coffee manufacturers are distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets that may serve as substitutes for the company’s coffees regional specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in supermarkets   in addition to the competition generated by supermarket sales of coffee starbucks competes for whole bean coffee sales with franchise operators and independent

resources than the company   in addition the company faces intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores there can be no assurance that starbucks will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company will be able to attract a
