competition 

we are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are 

 our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of oems 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by aerospace acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4057 million 3403 million and 3203 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3491 million 2832 million and 2546 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2020 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oems’ production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

international operations 

we engage in manufacturing sales service and research and development rd globally us exports and nonus manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 15 of our total sales in 2019  13 in 2018 and 12 in 2017  nonus manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 40 of our total sales in 2019  43 in 2018 and 44 in 2017  



information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in item 1a risk factors under the caption “macroeconomic and industry risks” 

backlog 

our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements backlog was 25612 million and 24850 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  we expect to recognize approximately 57 of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2020  and the remaining balance thereafter 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2019  we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials 

prices of certain key raw materials including copper fluorspar tungsten salts ethylene aluminum and molybdenum in performance materials and technologies and nickel steel titanium and other metals in aerospace are expected to fluctuate we offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2020  

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment our policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we engage in the handling manufacturing use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies our policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list while there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or any existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

employees 

we have approximately 113000 employees at december 31 2019  of whom approximately 44000 are located in the united states 

information about our executive officers 

the executive officers of honeywell listed as follows are elected annually by the board of directors there are no family relationships among them 








 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near and longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls antitrust regulations employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as sanctions and embargoes differing levels of protection of intellectual property acts of industrial espionage violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political regulatory and economic landscape the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers trends such as populism economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

while there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome and full terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states increased tariffs on uk imports and exports and increased regulatory complexities the company has developed plans to mitigate the potential impact of these possible restrictions but the implications of these uncertainties could affect the companys business financial position and results of operations 

existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results 

the united states has commenced certain trade actions including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from china and other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could increase the cost of our products 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

operating outside the united states also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk the laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us and may impose joint venture technology transfer local service or other foreign investment requirements and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations 

we may be required to transition from the use of the libor interest rate index in the future 

we have certain contracts indexed to libor to calculate the interest rate the continued availability of the libor index is not guaranteed after 2021 we cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted the language in certain of our liborbased contracts identify various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected if a trigger is satisfied such contracts may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our contracts may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index or indices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

operational risks 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in performance materials and technologies copper fluorspar tungsten salts ethylene aluminum and molybdenum and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties cybersecurity concerns compliance issues or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iv enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products v develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively vi monitor disruptive technologies and business models vii achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending viii respond to changes in overall trends related to endmarket demand and ix attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution additional unexpected costs realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations in addition organizational changes increased attrition failure to create and implement a succession plan for key company positions not retaining key talent inability to attract new employees with unique skills labor relations difficulties or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

as a supplier to the us government we are subject to unique risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including investigation of violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require injunctive relief measures including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases or limiting access of our products to markets among others in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

the development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks 

an increasing number of our products services and technologies are delivered with internet of things iot capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors data and advanced computing capabilities we have developed product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks but despite these efforts if our products and services that include iot solutions do not work as intended or are compromised the possible consequences include financial loss reputational damage exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions theft of intellectual property and diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy data protection and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example the state of california recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of iot devices effective in january 2020 european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe the european union general data protection regulation which became enforceable in may 2018 superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods power outages fires explosions terrorism equipment failures sabotage cyber incidents adverse weather conditions labor disputes critical supply failure inaccurate downtime forecast political disruption and other reasons which can result in undesirable consequences including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers public health crises like a regional or global pandemic could disrupt our supply chain distribution channels production facilities operations and customer demand which could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business we employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures cybersecurity incidents and other events including disruptions at our cloud computing server systems and other third party it service providers could interfere with our operations interrupt production and shipments damage customer and business partner relationships and negatively impact our reputation 

concentrations of credit and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations 

we maintain longterm contract relationships with many of our customers suppliers and other counterparties while we monitor the financial health of these counterparties we are exposed to credit and market risks to the extent that customers suppliers and other counterparties are concentrated in similar industries and geographic regions changes in economic conditions in these industries or geographic regions could result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty which may lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties in the same industry or geography impacting our ability to renew our longterm contract arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements 

legal and regulatory risks 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof potential taxation of digital services changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation as well as multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations within honeywell building technologies and safety and productivity solutions the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards regulations and judicial determinations  growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics than the voluntary commitments that the company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products they could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust accounting import and export and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

this selected financial data should be read in conjunction with honeywell’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report as well as the section of this annual report titled item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc and its consolidated subsidiaries “honeywell” or “the company” for the three years ended december 31 2019  all references to notes relate to notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

on october 1 2018 we completed the taxfree spinoff to honeywell shareowners of our transportation systems business previously part of aerospace into a standalone publiclytraded company garrett motion inc “garrett” 

on october 29 2018 we completed the taxfree spinoff to honeywell shareowners of our homes and global distribution business previously part of home and building technologies renamed honeywell building technologies following the spinoff into a standalone publiclytraded company resideo technologies inc “resideo” 

we removed the assets and liabilities associated with garrett and resideo from our consolidated balance sheet as of the effective dates of the respective spinoffs we included the results of operations for garrett and resideo in our consolidated statement of operations through the effective dates of the respective spinoffs total sales and total cost of products and services sold attributable to these spinoffs impacting segment profit were 66 billion and 48 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 

a detailed discussion of the prior year 2018 to 2017 yearoveryear changes are not included herein and can be found in the managements discussion and analysis section in the 2018 annual report on form 10k filed february 8 2019 

executive summary 

during 2019  we continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create longterm shareowner value income before taxes grew 1 to  76 billion despite the spinoffs the improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins we believe our ability to drive continuous earnings growth over a long history results from consistently identifying and investing in productivity initiatives we continue to focus on commercial excellence and improvements in our manufacturing and operational processes including our integrated supply chain and honeywell digital transformations to drive higher sales at better margins 

we are careful not to allow the attainment of shortterm financial results to imperil the creation of longterm sustainable shareowner value we are committed to a strategy to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies our technology investments allow us to introduce new technology solutions in high growth businesses in broadbased attractive industrial end markets each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global megatrends including energy efficiency infrastructure investment urbanization and safety 

in 2019 we deployed capital of 78 billion including capital expenditures dividends share repurchases mergers and acquisitions and venture investments 

business objectives 

our businesses are focused on the following objectives 



consolidated results of operations 

net sales 



net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the spinoffs our 2018 results included 6550 million of sales related to the transportation systems and homes and global distribution businesses absent the impact of the spinoffs during 2018 sales grew 4 from 35252 in 2018 to 36709 in 2019 

the change in net sales is attributable to the following 



a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by the strengthening of the us dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets primarily the euro british pound and chinese renminbi 

cost of products and services sold 



cost of products and services sold decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower direct and indirect material costs of approximately 3920 million lower labor costs of approximately 160 million both driven by the spinoffs of the transportation systems and homes and global distribution businesses and lower repositioning and other charges of approximately 530 million largely due to lower asbestos and environmental related charges net of the reimbursements absent the impact of these items during 2018 cost of products and services sold increased approximately 3 

gross margin percentage increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher gross margin in the segments approximately 14 percentage points with higher aerospace honeywell building technologies and performance materials and technologies gross margins including the favorable impact following the spinoffs partially offset by lower safety and productivity solutions gross margin additionally gross margin percentage increased due to the lower costs within cost of products and services sold for repositioning and other charges approximately 15 percentage point impact and pension service costs approximately 02 percentage point impact 

selling general and administrative expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the impact of the spinoffs in addition selling general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by labor inflation 

other income expense 



other income expense decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower pension nonservice income partially offset by lower separation costs 

tax expense 



the effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily resulting from the impacts of revised guidance related to us tax reform and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a 281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings 

the effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately 11 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings in addition we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act “us tax reform” which was partially offset by 411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the homes and global distribution business and the transportation systems business in advance of their spinoffs 

for further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate see note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to honeywell 



earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily driven by the absence of profit attributable to the spinoffs higher income tax expense attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to us tax reform and internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year partially offset by increased operational segment profit and lower repositioning and other charges 

review of business segments 

we globally manage our business operations through four segments aerospace honeywell building technologies performance materials and technologies and safety and productivity solutions 



aerospace 





2019 compared with 2018 

aerospace sales decreased due to the impact of the spinoff of the transportation systems business our 2018 results included 2622 million of sales related to the spinoff absent the impact of the spinoff during 2018 sales grew approximately 9 from 12871 million to 14054 million due to growth in organic sales 

 aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to organic sales volume price and productivity net of inflation partially offset by the divestiture impacts following the spinoff of the transportation systems business cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the spinoff of the transportation systems business and productivity net of inflation partially offset by higher sales volume 

honeywell building technologies 





2019 compared with 2018 

honeywell building technologies sales decreased due to the impact of the spinoff of the homes and global distribution business our 2018 results included 3928 million of sales related to the spinoff absent the impact of the spinoff during 2018 sales grew approximately 6 from 5370 million to 5717 million 

 honeywell building technologies segment profit decreased primarily due to the divestiture impacts following the spinoff of the homes and global distribution business this was offset by an increase in organic sales volumes and price partially offset by inflation cost of products and services sold decreased due to the spinoff partially offset by higher sales volumes 

performance materials and technologies 





2019 compared with 2018 

performance materials and technologies sales increased primarily due to organic growth mainly due to volumes partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 

 performance materials and technologies segment profit increased primarily due to productivity net of inflation and price partially offset by higher sales of lower margin products and the impact of foreign currency translation cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher sales volumes partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and productivity net of inflation 

safety and productivity solutions 





2019 compared with 2018 

safety and productivity solutions sales decreased primarily due to lower organic sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by acquisitions 

 safety and productivity solutions segment profit decreased as a result of lower sales volumes in productivity products higher sales of lower margin products and the impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by higher productivity net of inflation favorable pricing and acquisitions cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to higher productivity net of inflation and the impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by acquisitions 

repositioning charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2019  2018 and 2017  cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 249 million 285 million and 177 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  and was funded through operating cash flows in 2020  we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows we maintain additional sources of liquidity including committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access nonus cash as a result of the us tax reform we use cash generated through operations to invest in our existing core businesses acquisitions share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 



2019 compared with 2018 

cash provided by operating activities increased by  463 million primarily due to 276 million decrease in net payments for repositioning and other charges largely due to asbestos and environmental related reimbursement receipts and a 35 million favorable impact from working capital favorable inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by accounts payable 

cash used by investing activities increased by  1560 million primarily due to a net 1762 million increase in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities 

cash used for financing activities increased by  1568 million primarily due to the prior year prespin separation funding of 2622 million net of spinoff cash an increase in cash dividends paid of 170 million and an increase in net repurchases of common stock of 169 million partially offset by a decrease in net debt payments of 1330 million 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

a source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2019 was 037 and as of december 31 2018 was 031 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2019  standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisitions 

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 13 longterm debt and credit agreements of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity 

in 2019  we repurchased  4400 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise on april 29 2019 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 100 billion of honeywell common stock of which 70 billion remained available as of december 31 2019 for additional share repurchases this authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program we expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans we will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases when attractive opportunities arise 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures share repurchases dividends strategic acquisitions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2020 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

contractual obligations 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2019  



 asbestos matters 

payments net of insurance recoveries related to known asbestos matters was 163 million 216 million and 239 million in 2019  2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately 320 million in 2020  we expect to pay these asbestos matters from operating cash flows the timing of these payments depends on several factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims 

reimbursements from garrett for payments related to asbestos matters as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was 152 million in 2019 and is expected to be approximately 115 million in 2020  we received approximately 36 million in january 2020 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our asbestos matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with garrett 

environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were  213 million  395 million and  287 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  in addition in 2019  2018 and 2017 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 99 million 95 million and 82 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

payments related to known environmental matters was  256 million  218 million and  212 million in 2019  2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately 220 million in 2020  we expect to pay these environmental matters from operating cash flows the timing of these payments depends on several factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties 

reimbursements from resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was 140 million in 2019 and is expected to be 140 million in 2020  we received approximately 35 million in january 2020 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with resideo 

financial instruments 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2019 and 2018  



 see note 15 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the agreements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material we consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies 

asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries —in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries 

our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company “narco” asbestos related claims we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrue for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claims was prepared in 2002 in the same year narco filed for bankruptcy protection using narco tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524g trusts accordingly the estimated value of future narco asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedures and prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claims was in effect which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances this estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of 743 million to 961 million  we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range given the trust’s lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual narco trust experience when sufficiently reliable claims data exists we will update our estimate of the narco trust liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized regarding bendix friction materials “bendix” asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous 

five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries 

reimbursement receivables —in conjunction with the garrett and resideo spinoffs the company entered into reimbursement agreements under which honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the bendix business in the us garrett and net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement resideo accordingly the company has recorded a receivable based on estimates in the underlying reimbursable honeywell spend and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of our reimbursement receivables 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense and a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2019  2018 and 2017 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following 



the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 123 million 37 million and 87 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 21 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 615 for 2020 down from 675 for 2019 reflecting a decline in interest rates and additional rebalancing of assets to more fixed income 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we used a 322 discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31 2019  reflecting a decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 



pension ongoing income for our worldwide pension plans is expected to be approximately 786 million in 2020 compared with pension ongoing income of  592 million in 2019  the expected increase in pension income is primarily due to lower interest cost from a decrease in discount rates in our us and uk plans and higher expected return on plan assets lower rate of return on a higher asset base also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2020  and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finitelived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates sales volume selling prices and costs cash flows and the discount rate selected these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment including market interest rates and expected volatility management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts including strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolution of any related appeals and litigation we assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 

for further discussion of additional income tax policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —we recognize sales for longterm contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method we recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer with control transferring over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation we generally use the costtocost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catchup basis which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

competition 

we are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are 

 our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of oems 

aerospace sales 

our aerospace segment sales were 37 36 and 38 of our total sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 our sales to commercial aerospace oems were 7 6 and 6 of our total sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13 13 and 12 of our total sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 

 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by aerospace acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3403 million 3203 million and 3330 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2832 million 2546 million and 2647 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2019 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oems’ production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

backlog 

our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts starting in 2018 following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements backlog was 24850 million and 17690 million at december 31 2018 and 2017 we expect to recognize approximately 56 of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2019 and the remaining balance thereafter

 information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in item 1a risk factors under the caption “macroeconomic and industry risks” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2018 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials 

the costs of certain key raw materials including r240 copper fluorspar tungsten salts ethylene and perchloroethylene in performance materials and technologies and nickel steel titanium and other metals in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2019 

 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacturing use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is also possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures earnings competitive position or financial standing we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

employees 

we have approximately 114000 employees at december 31 2018 of whom approximately 44000 are located in the united states 

 

executive officers of the registrant 

the executive officers of honeywell listed as follows are elected annually by the board of directors there are no family relationships among them 

  

 


 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 6 

 

 an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls antitrust regulations employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as sanctions and embargoes violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political regulatory and economic landscape the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers trends such as populism economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

while it is currently not known what the final outcome and full terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states increased tariffs on uk imports and exports and increased regulatory complexities 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations 

 

operational risks 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in performance materials and technologies r240 copper fluorspar tungsten salts ethylene and perchloroethylene and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification and v the inability to collect on the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with our spinoffs garrett motion inc and resideo technologies inc 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iv enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products v develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively vi monitor disruptive technologies and business models vii achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending viii respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand and x attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products 

 

the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations in addition organizational changes increased attrition failure to create and implement a succession plan for key company positions not retaining key talent inability to attract new employees with unique skills labor relations difficulties or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

as a supplier to the us government we are subject to unique risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including investigation of violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require injunctive relief measures including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases or limiting access of our products to markets among others in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup 

 

requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example the state of california recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of internet of things devices which will go into effect in january 2020 european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe the european union general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods power outages fires explosions terrorism equipment failures sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes critical supply failure inaccurate downtime forecast political disruption and other reasons which can result in undesirable consequences including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers we employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at our cloud computing server systems and other third party it service providers could interfere with our operations interrupt production and shipments damage customer and business partner relationships and negatively impact our reputation 

legal and regulatory risks 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof potential expansion of taxation on digital services changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation as well as multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations within honeywell building technologies the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards regulations and judicial determinations  growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which 

 

creates economic and regulatory uncertainty if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products they could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust accounting import and export and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

executive summary 

during 2018 honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create longterm shareowner value we grew net sales 3 to 41802 million and grew income before taxes 8 to 7487 million the improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins we believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent rigorous deployment of the honeywell operating system as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives we have continued our focus on commercial excellence processes such as velocity product development “vpd” to drive higher sales at better margins 

we are careful not to allow the attainment of shortterm financial results to imperil the creation of longterm sustainable shareowner value hence as part of the announcement in october 2017 of the results of our portfolio review we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global megatrends including energy efficiency infrastructure investment urbanization and safety 

 

in 2018 we deployed capital of 76 billion including the following 

 consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

the foreign currency translation impact in 2018 compared with 2017 was principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the euro against the us dollar 

the foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat the strengthening of the euro was offset by the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 

cost of products and services sold 

 cost of products and services sold increased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately 790 million driven by higher sales volume and inflation partially offset by divestitures and productivity and higher repositioning and other charges of approximately 70 million 

gross margin percentage decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to higher repositioning and other charges approximately 02 percentage point impact partially offset by higher gross margin in the segments approximately 01 percentage point impact collectively 

cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately 290 million driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity net of inflation higher repositioning and 

 

other charges of approximately 220 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately 90 million partially offset by decreased indirect material costs of approximately 70 million and lower labor costs of approximately 60 million 

gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in aerospace and performance materials and technologies approximately 17 percentage point impact collectively partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges approximately 05 percentage point impact and by lower gross margin in home and building solutions and safety and productivity solutions approximately 03 percentage point impact collectively 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to productivity and divestiture impacts partially offset by labor inflation and higher repositioning charges 

selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs driven primarily by acquisitions net of divestitures investment for growth and merit increases and higher repositioning charges 

other income expense 

 other income expense increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to an increase in pension ongoing income–nonservice favorable impacts of foreign currency and an increase in interest income partially offset by separation costs associated with the spinoffs of our homes and global distribution business and transportation systems business 

other income expense increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to due to an increase in pension ongoing income–nonservice 

tax expense 

 the effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately 11 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings in addition we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act “us tax reform” which was partially offset by 411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the homes and global distribution business and the transportation systems business in advance of their spinoffs 

the effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily from the estimated impacts of us tax reform of approximately 38 billion partially offset by lower tax rates on nonus earnings 

the effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily from lower tax rates on nonus earnings 

for further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate see note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily driven by the lower income tax expenses due to reduction of accrued withholding taxes and the higher comparative income taxes in 2017 from us tax reform higher segment profit increased pension and other postretirement income and lower share count partially offset by separation costs and higher repositioning and other charges 

earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by additional income tax expense from us tax reform higher repositioning and other charges partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments lower pension marktomarket expense and increased pension and other postretirement income

repositioning charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2018 2017 and 2016 cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 285 million 177 million and 228 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 and was funded through operating cash flows in 2019 we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access nonus cash as a result of the us tax reform we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

 2018 compared with 2017 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 468 million primarily due to a 239 million increase in customer advances and deferred income and lower cash tax payments of 185 million 

cash provided by investing activities increased by 4601 million primarily due to a net 4302 million decrease in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities and a 620 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 453 million

cash provided by financing activities increased by 3862 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of 2827 million an increase in net repurchases of common stock of 699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of 204 million 

 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2018 was 031 and as of december 31 2017 was 017 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2018 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisitions 

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 13 longterm debt and credit agreements of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity 

in 2018 the company repurchased 4000 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise in december 2017 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 8 billion of honeywell common stock of which 37 billion remained available as of december 31 2018 for additional share repurchases this authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans we will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures share repurchases dividends strategic acquisitions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2019 to be as follows 

 27 

 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2018 we realized 2622 million in net cash proceeds from the spinoff of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2018 

  

 28 

 

 environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were 395 million 287 million and 195 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 in addition in 2018 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 95 million 82 million and 83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

spending related to known environmental matters was 218 million 212 million and 228 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 and is estimated to be approximately 175 million in 2019 we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties 

reimbursements from resideo for spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was 25 million in 2018 and is expected to be 140 million in 2019 such reimbursements will offset operating cash outflows incurred by the company 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with resideo 

financial instruments 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2018 and 2017

 see note 15 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the agreements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies 

asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries and indemnification receivables —honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company “narco” asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claims was prepared in 2002 in the same year narco filed for bankruptcy protection using narco tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524g trusts accordingly the estimated value of future narco asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedures and prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claims was in effect which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures 

 

estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances this estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of 743 million to 961 million we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range given the trust’s lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual narco trust experience regarding bendix friction materials “bendix” asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries 

additionally in conjunction with the garrett spinoff the company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a garrett subsidiary pursuant to which garrett’s subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities accordingly the company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of garrett and its general ability to pay 

see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries and additional details regarding the indemnification and reimbursement agreement 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense and a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2018 2017 and 2016 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following 

 31 

 

the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 37 million 87 million and 273 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 21 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 675 for 2019 down from 775 for 2018 reflecting a rebalancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we used a 435 discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31 2018 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for our worldwide pension plans is expected to be approximately 590 million in 2019 compared with pension ongoing income of 992 million in 2018 the expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower actual asset returns in 2018 and a lower expected return on asset assumption for 2019 in our us and uk plans also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2019 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates sales volume selling prices and costs cash flows and the discount rate selected these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment including market interest rates and expected volatility management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences 

for further discussion of additional income tax policies and provision items recorded in regards to us tax reform see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —we recognize sales for longterm contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method we recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer with control transferring over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation we generally use the costtocost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates 

 

include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catchup basis which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

competition 

we are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are 

 our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes many of our competitors have substantial 

 

financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of oems 

aerospace sales 

our aerospace segment sales were 36 38 and 39 of our total sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 our sales to commercial aerospace oems were 6 6 and 8 of our total sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13 12 and 12 of our total sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by aerospace acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3203 million 3330 million and 3743 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2546 million 2647 million and 2680 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 us defense spending decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2018 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oems’ production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2017 and 2016 was 17690 million and 17277 million we anticipate that approximately 12337 million of the 2017 backlog will be filled in 2018 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option the 2016 backlog previously disclosed has been revised to apply the methodology used for the 2017 backlog and excludes certain previously included amounts that do not meet the criteria for inclusion 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development rd globally us exports and nonus manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 12 of our total sales in 2017 13 in 2016 and 14 in 2015 nonus manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 44 of our total sales in 2017 43 in 2016 and 39 in 2015 

 information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in item 1a risk factors under the caption “macroeconomic and industry risks” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2017 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials 

the costs of certain key raw materials including r240 fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene in performance materials and technologies and nickel steel titanium and other metals in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw 

 

material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2018 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

research and development 

the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china research and development expense totaled 1835 million 1864 million and 1856 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 rd expense was 5 of sales in each of 2017 2016 and 2015 customersponsored principally by the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 876 million 967 million and 998 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacturing use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is also possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures earnings competitive position or financial standing we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

employees 

we have approximately 131000 employees at december 31 2017 of whom approximately 46000 are located in the united states 

 

executive officers of the registrant 

the executive officers of honeywell listed as follows are elected annually by the board of directors there are no family relationships among them 

  

 


 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they 

 

are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements including with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed spinoffs we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 6 

 

 an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls antitrust regulations employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as sanctions and embargoes violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment including the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union and the evolving international and domestic political regulatory and economic landscape the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers trends such as populism economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations 

operational risks 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in performance materials and technologies r240 fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene and in 

 

aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification 

the proposed spinoffs of our homes and global distribution business and of our transportation systems business into two standalone publiclytraded companies are each contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

on october 10 2017 the company announced its intention to separately spinoff our homes and global distribution business which is part of our home and building technologies segment and our transportation systems business which is part of our aerospace segment into two standalone publiclytraded companies completion of each proposed spinoff is subject to readiness of each spinoff to operate as an independent public company finalization of the financial statements of the spunoff business assurance that the separation will be taxfree to our shareowners for us federal income tax purposes finalization of the capital structure of the three corporations the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the us securities and exchange commission final approval of the board of directors and other customary matters each proposed spinoff is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments credit and equity markets or changes in market conditions these or other unanticipated developments could delay or prevent the proposed spinoffs or cause the proposed spinoffs to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated including without limitation the failure to qualify as taxfree to our shareowners and the inability of the two spunoff companies to incur sufficient indebtedness to allow for a distribution to honeywell of proceeds concurrently with the consummation of the spinoffs or to make ongoing cash contributions towards the satisfaction of certain of our legacy asbestos and environmental remediation liabilities furthermore if the spinoffs are completed we cannot assure you that each will be successful in meeting its objectives there is the potential for business disruption and significant separation costs any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock 

 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iv enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products v develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively vi monitor disruptive technologies and business models vii achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending viii respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand and x attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products 

the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations in addition organizational changes attrition labor relations difficulties or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

as a supplier to the us government we are subject to unique risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including investigation of violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of 

 

personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data and other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the 

 

regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods power outages fires explosions terrorism equipment failures sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes critical supply failure inaccurate downtime forecast political disruption and other reasons which can result in undesirable consequences including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers we employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at our cloud computing server systems and other third party it service providers could interfere with our operations interrupt production and shipments damage customer and business partner relationships and negatively impact our reputation 

legal and regulatory risks 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation as well as multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact transportation systems within home and building technologies the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards regulations and judicial determinations growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc and its consolidated subsidiaries “honeywell” or “the company” for the three years ended december 31 2017 all references to notes relate to notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

in october 2017 the company announced the results of a comprehensive portfolio review which included the announcement of our intent to spinoff our homes and global distribution business as well as our transportation systems business into two standalone publicly traded companies 

effective october 2017 we realigned the smart energy business previously part of the home and building technologies segment into the process solutions business within the performance materials and technologies segment effective july 2016 the company realigned the business units comprising its automation and control solutions segment by forming two new segments home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions these realignments have no impact on the company’s historical consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation 

on october 1 2016 the company completed the taxfree spinoff of its resins and chemicals business part of performance materials and technologies into a standalone publiclytraded company named advansix inc “advansix” to honeywell shareowners the assets and liabilities associated with advansix have been removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the spinoff the results of operations for advansix are included in the consolidated statement of operations through the effective date of the spinoff 

on september 16 2016 the company completed the sale of the aerospace government services business honeywell technology solutions inc “htsi” or “government services business” the assets and liabilities associated with htsi have been removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the sale the results of operations for htsi are included in the consolidated statement of operations through the effective date of the sale 

executive summary 

during 2017 honeywell continued to successfully deliver on its financial commitments while still creating longterm value for our shareowners we grew net sales 3 to 40534 million and grew income before taxes 7 to 6902 million the improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both organic sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins we believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent rigorous deployment of the honeywell operating system as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives we have made concerted efforts to revitalize our commercial excellence processes such as velocity product development “vpd” which enables higher organic revenue at better margins 

we are careful to not allow the attainment of shortterm financial results imperil the creation of longterm sustainable shareowner value hence as part of the announcement in october 2017 of the results of our portfolio review we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global megatrends including energy efficiency infrastructure investment urbanization and safety 

 

in 2017 we deployed capital of over 6 billion including the following 

 consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

the foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat the strengthening of the euro was offset by the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 

the foreign currency translation impact in 2016 compared with 2015 is principally driven by the weakening of the british pound chinese renminbi and canadian dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar 

cost of products and services sold 

 cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately 290 million driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity net of inflation higher repositioning and other charges of approximately 260 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately 90 million partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income and lower pension marktomarket expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately 110 million and decreased indirect material costs of approximately 70 million 

gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in aerospace and performance materials and technologies approximately 17 percentage point impact collectively and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income and lower pension market to market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold approximately 03 percentage point impact partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges approximately 

 

06 percentage point impact and by lower gross margin in home and building solutions and safety and productivity solutions approximately 03 percentage point impact collectively 

cost of products and services sold increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately 380 million driven primarily by acquisitions net of divestitures partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity net of inflation and foreign currency translation higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately 135 million and increased pension marktomarket expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of 70 million partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold of 200 million 

gross margin percentage increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to higher gross margin in performance materials and technologies approximately 02 percentage point impact and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold approximately 05 percentage point impact partially offset by lower gross margin in aerospace home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions an approximately 03 percentage point impact collectively and increased pension marktomarket expense allocated to cost of products and services sold approximately 02 percentage point impact 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs driven primarily by acquisitions net of divestitures investment for growth and merit increases and higher repositioning charges partially offset by decreased pension marktomarket expense allocated to sga 

sga increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to increased labor costs driven primarily by acquisitions net of divestitures investment for growth and merit increases increased pension marktomarket expense allocated to sga and higher repositioning charges partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and increased pension income allocated to sga 

tax expense 

 on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” that instituted fundamental changes to the us tax system the tax act includes changes to the taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system expansion of the current antideferral rules a minimum tax on lowtaxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion the tax act also permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 imposes a onetime mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates and implements a territorial style tax system the impacts of these changes are reflected in the 2017 tax expense which resulted in a provisional charge of approximately 38 billion which is subject to adjustment given the provisional nature of the charge this resulted in an effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate in 2017 

the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to lower tax rates on nonus earnings 

the company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2018 to be in the range of 220 and 230 the effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items the resolution of income tax audits changes in tax laws the tax impact from employee sharebased payments taxes incurred in connection to the territorial style tax system or other items such as pension marktomarket adjustments 

 

for further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate see note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by additional income tax expense from the tax act higher repositioning and other charges partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments lower pension marktomarket expense and increased pension and other postretirement income 

earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income higher segment profit in home and building technologies and performance materials and technologies the gain related to the honeywell technology solutions inc divestiture a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the financial accounting standards board’s fasb accounting standard related to employee sharebased payment accounting partially offset by lower segment profit in aerospace and safety and productivity solutions increased pension marktomarket expense and higher repositioning and other charges

repositioning charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2017 2016 and 2015 these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of 300 million in 2018 compared with 2017 principally from planned workforce reductions cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 177 million 228 million and 118 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 and was funded through operating cash flows in 2018 we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 250 million and to be funded through operating cash flows 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access nonus cash as a result of the tax act we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

 2017 compared with 2016 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 468 million primarily due to a 504 million increase in segment profit and a 294 million favorable impact from working capital favorable accounts payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by higher cash tax payments of 609 million 

cash used for investing activities increased by 232 million primarily due to i a net 2056 million increase in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities ii an increase of 500 million of settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and iii a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses of 296 million most significantly honeywell technology solutions inc in 2016 partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 2491 million most significantly intelligrated in 2016

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2017 was 017 and as of december 31 2016 was 013 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2017 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisitions 

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 12 longterm debt and credit agreements of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity 

in 2017 the company repurchased 2889 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans additionally we sought to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arose in december 2017 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 8 billion of honeywell common stock of which 77 billion remained available as of december 31 2017 for additional share repurchases this authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans we will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise 

at december 31 2017 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act the company no longer intends to permanently reinvest its historical foreign earnings and plans to repatriate at least 7 billion of such earnings to the us over the next two years 

 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2018 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2016 we realized 565 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spinoff of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2017 

  

 environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were 287 million 195 million and 194 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 in addition in 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 82 million and 83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

spending related to known environmental matters was 212 million 228 million and 273 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 and is estimated to be approximately 225 million in 2018 we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters 

financial instruments 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments 

 

based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2017 and 2016 

  

 see note 14 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the agreements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a 

 

discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company “narco” asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claims was prepared in 2002 in the same year narco filed for bankruptcy protection using narco tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524g trusts accordingly the estimated value of future narco asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedures and also prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claims was in effect which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances the estimated value of the future narco liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against narco over a fifteen year period this projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of 743 million to 961 million we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range given the trust’s lack of sufficient claims processing experience since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection it is not yet possible to reliably estimate future claim costs based on actual trust experience regarding bendix friction materials “bendix” asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense and a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment 

 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2017 2016 and 2015 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following 

  

 the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 87 million 273 million and 67 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 for 2018 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we used a 368 discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31 2017 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 984 million in 2018 compared with pension ongoing income of 713 million in 2017 the expected increase is 

 

primarily due to higher asset returns in 2017 in our us and uk plans also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2018 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates sales volume selling prices and costs cash flows and the discount rate selected these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment including market interest rates and expected volatility management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2017 we recognized approximately 16 of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management 

 

judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

competition 

 

we are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of oems 

 

aerospace sales 

 

our aerospace segment sales were 38 39 and 39 of our total sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 our sales to commercial aerospace oems were 6 8 and 6 of our total sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12 12 and 11 of our total sales in 2016 2015 and 2014

 

us government sales 

 

sales to the us government principally by aerospace acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3330 million 3743 million and 3693 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2647 million 2680 million and 2792 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 us defense





spending decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2017 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oems’ production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs as well as our diversified commercial businesses

 

backlog 

 

our total backlog at december 31 2016 and 2015 was 19075 million and 18183 million we anticipate that approximately 12022 million of the 2016 backlog will be filled in 2017 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option

 

international operations 

 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development rd globally us exports and nonus manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 13 of our total sales in 2016 and 14 in each of 2015 and 2014 nonus manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 43 of our total sales in 2016 39 in 2015 and 41 in 2014

 

  

information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in item 1a risk factors under the caption “macroeconomic and industry risks”

 

raw materials 

 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2016 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials

 

the costs of certain key raw materials including r240 fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene in performance materials and technologies and nickel steel titanium and other metals in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2017

 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business

 

research and development 

 

the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china research and development expense totaled 2143 million 1856 million and 1892 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 rd expense was 5 of sales in each of 2016 2015 and 2014 customersponsored principally by the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 967 million 998 million and 1034 million in 2016 2015 and 2014





environment 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses

 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is also possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances

 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole

 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures earnings competitive position or financial standing we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934

 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k

 

risk factors 

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results

 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 

  

  

 



  

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls antitrust regulations employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment including the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union and the evolving us political regulatory and economic landscape following the 2016 elections and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins

 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss

 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations

 

operational risks 

 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in performance materials and technologies r240 fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations

 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale





production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships

 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification

 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iv enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products v develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively and vi attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products

 

the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects

 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations in addition organizational changes attrition labor relations difficulties or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations

 

as a supplier to the us government we are subject to unique risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future

 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government





procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including investigation of violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended

 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations

 

legal and regulatory risks 

 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

 

our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments





of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to address base erosion and profit shifting and potential comprehensive us tax reform which among other things might change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes

 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact transportation systems within home and building technologies the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be affected by environmental safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive

 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

tax expense 

 

 



for discussion of changes in the effective tax rate see note 5 income taxes in the notes to financial statements

 

the effective tax rates for 2016 2015 and 2014 are lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to lower tax rates on nonus earnings the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the united states

 

the company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 25 the effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items the resolution of income tax audits changes in tax laws or other items such as pension marktomarket adjustments and the tax impact from employee sharebased payments

 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 

  

earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income higher segment profit in home and building technologies and performance materials and technologies the gain related to the honeywell technology solutions inc divestiture a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the fasb’s accounting standard related to employee sharebased payment accounting partially offset by lower segment profit in aerospace and safety and productivity solutions increased pension marktomarket expense and higher repositioning and other charges

 

earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities

repositioning charges 

 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2016 2015 and 2014 these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of 200 million to 300 million in 2017 compared with 2016 principally from planned workforce reductions cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 228 million 118 million and 161 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 and was funded through operating cash flows in 2017 we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 225 million and to be funded through operating cash flows

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends

liquidity 

 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets at december 31 2016 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability





we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities

 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2016 was 013 and as of december 31 2015 was 026 

 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2016 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity

 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisitions

 

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 12 longterm debt and credit agreements of notes to financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity

 

in 2016 the company repurchased 2079 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans in april 2016 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 5 billion of honeywell common stock of which 41 billion remained available as of december 31 2016 for additional share repurchases honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans

 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments

 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2017 to be as follows

 

  

  

  

  

 



satisfy regulatory funding standards the timing and amount of contributions to both our us and nonus plans may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans

 

  

  

we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2016 and 2015 we realized 565 million and 1 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spinoff of nonstrategic businesses

 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities

 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2016

 

  

 



environmental matters 

 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were 195 million 194 million and 268 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 in addition in 2016 and 2015 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 83 million and 90 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations

 

spending related to known environmental matters was 228 million 273 million and 321 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 and is estimated to be approximately 250 million in 2017 we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties

 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters

 

financial instruments 

 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2016 and 2015

 

  

  

see note 14 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to financial statements for further discussion on the agreements





critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements

 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies

 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524g trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the trust distribution procedures by the narco trust a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims which remained in place throughout narco’s chapter 11 case some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances the estimated value of future narco claims was originally established at the time of the narco chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against narco over a fifteen year period this projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of 743 million to 961 million we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years

 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries





see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries

 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment and service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense

 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2016 2015 and 2014 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following

 

  

  

the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 273 million 67 million and 249 million in 2016 2015 and 2014

 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 for 2017 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments

 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we used a 420 discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31 2016 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend

 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment





  

pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 715 million in 2017 compared with pension ongoing income of 601 million in 2016 the expected increase is primarily due to higher asset returns in 2016 and lower interest costs due to a decline in discount rates mainly in our us and uk plans also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2017 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets

 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows

 

  

once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry growth rates sales volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment including market interest rates and expected volatility management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing — goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions

 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections





of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences

 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2016 we recognized approximately 13 of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

competition 

we are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are 

 our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of oems 

aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 39 39 and 40 of our total sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 our sales to commercial aerospace oems were 8 6 and 7 of our total sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12 11 and 11 of our total sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by aerospace acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3743 million 3693 million and 3856 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2680 million 2792 million and 3066 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 us defense spending decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2016 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oems’ production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 18183 million and 18313 million we anticipate that approximately 11601 million of the 2015 backlog will be filled in 2016 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development globally us exports and nonus manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 14 of our total sales in each of 2015 2014 and 2013 nonus manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 39 of our total sales in 2015 and 41 in 2014 and 2013 

 raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2015 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to r240 a key component in foam blowing agents a raw material used in pmt 

the costs of certain key raw materials including cumene natural gas r240 sulfur fluorspar ethylene and perchloroethylene in pmt and nickel steel titanium and other metals in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2016 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

research and development 

the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china research and development rd expense totaled 1856 million 1892 million and 1804 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 rd expense was 5 of sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 customersponsored principally by the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 998 million 1034 million and 969 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental 

 

damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is also possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 6 

 

 an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls antitrust regulations employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations 

operational risks 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in pmt cumene fluorspar r240 natural gas perchloroethylene sulfur and ethylene and aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be 

 

constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and non traditional competitors iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively and v attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products 

the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond and mitigate these threats including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including multi jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to address base erosion and profit shifting will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact transportation systems within acs the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations pmt’s results of operations can be affected by environmental safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

 consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 15 

 

the change in net sales is attributable to the following

tax expense 

 for discussion of changes in the effective tax rate see note 5 income taxes in the notes to financial statements

the company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 265 the effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items the resolution of income tax audits changes in tax laws or other items such as pension marktomarket adjustments 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities

repositioning charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2015 2014 and 2013 these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of 175 million to 200 million in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from planned workforce reductions cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 118 million 161 million and 160 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 and was funded through operating cash flows in 2016 we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 175 million and to be funded through operating cash flows 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

 2015 compared with 2014 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 430 million primarily due to a 489 million favorable impact from working capital and a 382 million increase in net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment partially offset by i a 175 million decrease in customer advances and deferred income ii 151 million in oem incentives and iii increased cash tax payments of 50 million

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets at december 31 2015 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 026 and 060 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2015 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisitions 

during 2015 the company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks see note 12 longterm debt and credit agreements of notes to financial statements for further discussion on the credit agreements 

during 2015 the company repurchased 1884 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans in december 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 5 billion of honeywell common stock 22 billion remained available as of december 31 2015 for additional share repurchases honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including future option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans 

 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2016 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2015 and 2014 we realized 1 million and 160 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2015 

  

 environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were 194 million 268 million and 272 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 in addition in 2015 and 2014 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 90 million and 88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

spending related to known environmental matters was 273 million 321 million and 304 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 and is estimated to be approximately 250 million in 2016 we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters 

financial instruments 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments 

 

based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

 see note 14 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to financial statements for further discussion on the agreements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of 

 

management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018 in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524g trust as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims from january 2002 through the effective date of the narco trust on april 30 2013 we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment and service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2015 2014 and 2013 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following 

 the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the 

 

various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 67 million 249 million and 51 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 for 2016 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 446 discount rate as of december 31 2015 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 580 million in 2016 compared with pension ongoing income of 430 million in 2015 the expected increase is primarily due to lower service and interest costs resulting mainly from the change in our discount rate methodology as described in note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements and the plan amendment in the fourth quarter of 2015 to freeze final average compensation in our us pension plans as of december 31 2015 partially offset by the impact of lower asset returns in 2015 also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2016 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2015 we recognized approximately 14 of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 

management assessed the effectiveness of honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control–integrated framework 2013  management excluded the elster division of melrose industries plc elster acquired on december 29 2015 from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015 elster represented approximately 18 of our consolidated total assets and a de minimus percentage of our total consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2015 

based on this assessment management determined that honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 

the effectiveness of honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 




 item 9b other information 

under the iran threat reduction and syrian human rights act of 2012 which added section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 honeywell is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain executive orders 

a nonus whollyowned subsidiary of honeywell the nonus subsidiary inadvertently made four ground shipments of low value nonus items from turkey to uzbekistan from december 2013 to 

 

march 2014 that transited through iran en route to uzbekistan on trucks operated by a third party transportation vendor the vendor retained by the nonus subsidiary the nonus subsidiary hired the vendor to facilitate shipment and the vendor further engaged a trucking company to provide surface transport the vendor proposed the transport route for the shipment the shipment of the items via iran occurred inadvertently as a result of nonus person employees approving the transport route proposed by the vendor honeywell disclosed these past transactions voluntarily to the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac 

the nonus subsidiary did not pay directly or indirectly any duties or taxes to the government of iran as a result of these shipments because the shipments were made under tir transports internationaux routiers carnets a treaty system which allows for the transport of merchandise through contracting parties from the customs office of departure to the customs office of destination without payment of customs dutiestaxes in transiting countries further the nonus subsidiary made all payments for shipping services to the vendor on a flatfee basis at a rate of 11800 per shipment and the non us subsidiary did not reimburse the vendor for any fees or other expenses incurred in iran 

neither honeywell nor the nonus subsidiary derived any revenue by inadvertently shipping the items via iran

major businesses 

we globally manage our business operations through three businesses that are reported as operating segments aerospace automation and control solutions acs and performance materials and technologies pmt financial information related to our operating segments is included in note 21 segment financial data of notes to financial statements 

the major productsservices customersuses and key competitors of each of our operating segments are as follows

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas some of our key competitors are as follows 

 our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers 

aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 39 40 and 41 of our total sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 6 7 and 7 of our total sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 11 and 12 of our total sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3693 million 3856 million and 4109 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2792 million 3066 million and 3273 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively us defense spending decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2015 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us original equipment manufacturers’ production engineering 

 

development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 18313 million and 17512 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 12605 million of the 2014 backlog will be filled in 2015 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development globally us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 14 of our total sales in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 41 of our total sales in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 

 raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2014 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to r240 a key component in foam blowing agents a raw material used in our pmt segment 

the costs of certain key raw materials including cumene fluorspar r240 natural gas perchloroethylene sulfur and ethylene in our pmt business and nickel steel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2015 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights in our judgment our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

research and development 

the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china research and development rd expense totaled 1892 million 1804 million and 1847 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in rd expense of 5 in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased expenditures for new product development in our acs and pmt segments customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 1034 million 969 million and 835 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is also possible that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s national priority list although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

employees 

we have approximately 127000 employees at december 31 2014 of whom approximately 50000 are located in the united states 

 

executive officers of the registrant 

the executive officers of honeywell listed as follows are elected annually by the board of directors there are no family relationships among them

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations and in other parts of this report including this item 1a such discussions contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

 6 

 

 an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports represent more than half of the company’s sales risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes violations by our employees of anticorruption laws despite our efforts to mitigate these risks changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospace’s defense and space sales and results of operations 

a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant noncash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contributions funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations 

operational risks 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in pmt cumene fluorspar r240 natural gas perchloroethylene sulfur and ethylene and aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metals our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices 

 

to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

many major components product equipment items and raw materials particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on a single or solesource basis although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets with acceptable margins 

our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring new products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products 

the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve expected synergies iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and iv the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities or with regard to divested businesses claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification 

 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract our contracts with the us government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental employment or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

our us and nonus tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate 

our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety performance and product certification regulations within aerospace the operating results of our commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket business units may be impacted by among other things mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be effected by changes in government procurement regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact the transportation systems business unit within acs the demand for and cost of providing products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations pmt’s results of operations can be affected by environmental safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition

repositioning charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2014 2013 and 2012 these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of 100 million to 125 million in 2015 compared with 2014 principally from planned workforce reductions cash spending related to our repositioning actions was 161 million 160 million and 136 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and was funded through operating cash flows in 2015 we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately 150 million and to be funded through operating cash flows 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

 2014 compared with 2013 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 689 million primarily due to i a 508 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment ii reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of 233 million primarily due to the collection of a 130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of 98 million iii reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 131 million and iv lower cash tax payments of approximately 129 million partially offset by a 93 million unfavorable impact from working capital primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 1129 million most significantly intermec and rae systems inc in 2013 and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of 157 million most significantly friction materials partially offset by i a net 688 million increase in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities ii an increase of approximately 371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and iii a 147 million increase in expenditures for property plant and equipment 

cash used for financing activities increased by 1839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of 1589 million an increase in cash dividends paid of 157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 33 million 

2013 compared with 2012 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 818 million primarily due to i reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of 883 million ii a 447 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment iii a 135 million favorable impact from working capital driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately 352 million and a 260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges most significantly the narco trust establishment payments of 164 million 

 

cash used for investing activities increased by 531 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 695 million most significantly intermec and rae systems inc partially offset by an increase of approximately 190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 773 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of 1462 million partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of 651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of 142 million 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets at december 31 2014 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 060 and 079 respectively 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2014 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

on december 10 2013 the company entered into a 4 billion amended and restated five year credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed 45 billion the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes there have been no borrowings under the credit agreement 

 

during 2014 the company repurchased 924 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans in december 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 5 billion of honeywell common stock 41 billion remained available as of december 31 2014 for additional share repurchases 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2015 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2014 and 2013 we realized 160 million and 3 million respectively in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2014 

  

 environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were 268 million 272 million and 234 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition in both 2014 and 2013 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

spending related to known environmental matters was 321 million 304 million and 320 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and is estimated to be approximately 275 million in 2015 we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters 

financial instruments 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments 

 

based on a 10 weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

 see note 14 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to financial statements for further discussion 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of 

 

management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018 in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524g trust as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims from january 2002 through the effective date of the narco trust on april 30 2013 we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries 

see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of a potential marktomarket adjustment mtm adjustment and service and interest cost assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2014 2013 and 2012 net periodic pension income expense for our us plans included the following 

 the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the 

 

various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets the marktomarket accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 249 million 51 million and 957 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 for 2015 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments 

the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 408 discount rate in 2015 reflecting the significant decline in the market interest rate environment since the prior yearend 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 385 million in 2015 compared with pension ongoing income of 254 million in 2014 the increase in pension ongoing income in 2015 compared with 2014 results primarily from lower interest cost due to a decline in discount rates at december 31 2014 compared with december 31 2013 and an increase in the plans’ assets at december 31 2014 compared with december 31 2013 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2014 also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2015 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 30 

 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —in testing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

income taxes —on a recurring basis we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence such as past operating results projections of future taxable income enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2014 we recognized approximately 15 of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our aerospace acs and pmt segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

   aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 31 32 and 31 percent of our total sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7 7 and 6 percent of our total sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 12 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3856 4109 and 4276 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3066 3273 and 3374 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively us defense spending decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to anticipated lower us government spending levels mandated by the budget control act sequestration we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2014 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2014 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales as well as our diversified commercial businesses 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 16523 and 16307 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 12262 million of the 2013 backlog will be filled in 2014 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2013 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to r240 a key component in foam blowing agents a raw material used in our performance materials and technologies segment 

the costs of certain key raw materials including cumene fluorspar r240 natural gas perchloroethylene sulfur and ethylene in our performance materials and technologies business nickel steel and other metals in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2014 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell aclar ademco bendix bw callidus enovate esser firelite garrett genetron gent howard leight intermec jurid matrikon maxon mk north notifier novar oleflex parex rae systems rmg silent knight solstice spectra system sensor trend tridium and uop 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1804 1847 and 1799 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in rd expense of 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower pension primarily due to the absence of us pension marktomarket adjustment in 2013 and other postretirement expenses partially offset by the increased expenditures for new product development in our automation and control solutions and performance materials technologies segments the increase in rd expense of 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our aerospace segment and new product development in our automation and control solutions and performance materials technologies segments rd as a percentage of sales was 46 49 and 49 percent in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively customersponsored principally 

the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 969 835 and 867 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

we have approximately 131000 employees at december 31 2013 of which approximately 51000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2014 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 31 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion inventory levels in distribution channels and global economic growth rates performance materials and technologies’ operating results which generated 17 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion and raw material demand and supply volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013 are impacted by global production and demand for 

automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors including ability of consumers to obtain financing ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and non material inflation 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our performance materials and technologies cumene fluorspar r240 natural gas perchloroethylene sulfur and ethylene transportation systems nickel steel and other metals and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers’ decisions to exit certain businesses bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes eg product certification or stewardship requirements sourcing restrictions product authenticity climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards etc our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to among other things fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations result in personal injury or property damage damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts the same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by honeywell to large industrial refining and petrochemical customers 

failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses 

our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements through the honeywell enablers in addition we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to cost competitive regions and product line rationalizations risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition many of the restructuring actions are complex and difficult to implement hence we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expected the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to the financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a summary of our repositioning actions 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 

we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company andor its third party service providers while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats including access 

controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india the middle east and other high growth regions 

in 2013 approximately 55 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and sold outside the us as well as products manufactured in international locations were outside of the us including approximately 29 percent in europe and approximately 13 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions we are also subject to us laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

with more than half of the company’s sales generated internationally global economic conditions can have a significant impact on our total sales uncertain global economic conditions arising from a tepid recovery in the euro zone and varying rates of growth in emerging regions could reduce customer confidence that results in decreased demand for our products and services disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates a tightening of credit markets see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion and increased risk regarding supplier performance volatility in exchange rates of emerging market currencies present uncertainties that complicate planning and could unexpectedly impact our profitability presenting increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with whom we do business while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials as a result our operating margins may be negatively impacted fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our nonus businesses are translated into us dollars while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2013 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 208 billion and 08 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospace’s defense and space sales and results of operations 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 25 percent and 8 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2014 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract requirements complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for frequent design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to various government audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with 

various government regulations when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees vendors agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees vendors agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition data privacy and rights of employees any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health safety and environmental matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted 

by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits 

with approximately 131000 employees including approximately 51000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs legislative or regulatory changes and volatility in 

discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our us pension plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense including discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see “critical accounting policies” included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2013 our tax expense represented 268 percent of our income before tax our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures

executive summary 

for honeywell 2013 marked another year of growth and enhanced profitability despite a modest 25 percent growth in world gdp and industrial production honeywell’s 2013 revenues were 391 billion representing a 4 percent improvement compared to 2012 revenues of 377 billion our segment profit improved by 8 percent roughly two times revenue growth evidencing the company’s continued focus on operational excellence we achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on proactive repositioning see review of business segments section of this mda for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes 

the company’s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality bringing worldclass products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers honeywell refers to these processes as the honeywell enablers in 2013 honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the honeywell enablers 

 the company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics 

 27 

  operating cash flow grew by 23 percent in 2013 to 4335 million this operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest 947 million in capital expenditures partially fund the acquisitions discussed above make 156 million in nonus pension contributions provide a 10 percent increase in the company’s cash dividend rate vs 2012 and repurchase 135 million shares of common stock 

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

 cost of products and services sold increased by 73 million in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs of approximately 585 million and indirect material costs of approximately 115 million driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions and increased repositioning and other charges of approximately 140 million partially offset by a decrease in pension expense of approximately 760 million primarily driven by the 650 million decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold approximately 30 million in 2013 versus approximately 680 million in 2012 

gross margin percentage increased by 25 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to lower pension expense approximately 20 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of products and services 

sold higher segment gross margin in all of our business segments approximately 05 percentage point impact collectively and lower other postretirement expense 01 percentage point impact partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges approximately 04 percentage point impact 

cost of products and services sold decreased by 265 million or 1 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to a decrease in pension expense of approximately 800 million primarily driven by the decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold of 780 million and a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately 220 million partially offset by an estimated increase in direct material costs of approximately 620 million driven substantially by a 3 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors excluding price shown above and discussed in the review of business segments section of this mda and an increase in other postretirement expense of approximately 135 million due to the absence of 2011 curtailment gains 

gross margin percentage increased by 31 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to lower pension expense approximately 22 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold lower repositioning actions approximately 06 percentage point impact and higher segment gross margin in our aerospace automation and control solutions and performance materials and technologies segments approximately 04 percentage point impact collectively partially offset by higher other postretirement expense approximately 04 percentage point impact 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased as a percentage of sales by 06 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by i higher sales as a result of the factors discussed in the review of business segments section of this mda ii an estimated 270 million decrease in pension expense primarily driven by an approximately 250 million decrease in the pension marktomarket charge allocated to sga approximately 20 million in 2013 versus approximately 270 million in 2012 partially offset by an estimated 215 million increase in labor costs primarily acquisitions merit increases and investment for growth and an 80 million increase in repositioning charges 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales by 09 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by the impact of higher sales as a result of the factors discussed in the review of business segments section of this mda an estimated 110 million decrease in pension expense driven by the decrease in the portion of the pension marktomarket charge allocated to sga 90 million decrease due to foreign exchange and 80 million decrease in repositioning actions partially offset by the impact of an estimated 140 million increase in costs resulting from acquisitions investment for growth and merit increases net of other employee related costs 

other income expense 

 other income increased by 168 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to 195 million of realized gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities these securities be aerospace common stock designated as available for sale were obtained in conjunction with the sale of the 

consumables solutions business in july 2008 this gain was partially offset by an increase in loss on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets of 25 million primarily due to a pretax loss of approximately 28 million related to the pending divestiture of the friction materials business within our transportation systems segment see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures for further details 

other income decreased by 14 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a 50 million pretax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive onboard sensors products business within our automation and control solutions segment in the first quarter of 2011 partially offset by a loss of 29 million resulting from early redemption of debt in 2011 included within “other net” and the reduction of approximately 6 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2011 included within “other net” 

interest and other financial charges 

 interest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower borrowing costs partially offset by higher average debt balances 

interest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower borrowing costs partially offset by higher average debt balances 

tax expense 

 the effective tax rate increased by 24 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012 the year over year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower marktomarket pension expense in the us other factors causing an increase in the effective tax rate include higher tax expense related to an increase in tax reserves and higher state tax expense these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by tax benefits from retroactive law changes in the us the company’s foreign effective tax rate for 2013 was 190 percent an increase of approximately 20 percentage points compared to 2012 the year over year increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher expense related to retroactive tax law changes in germany and additional reserves in various jurisdictions coupled with higher earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 

the effective tax rate increased by 61 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings taxed at higher rates primarily driven by an approximate 61 percentage point impact from the decrease in pension marktomarket expense a decreased benefit from valuation allowances a decreased benefit from the settlement of tax audits and the absence of the us rd tax credit partially offset by a decreased expense related to tax reserves the foreign effective tax rate was 170 percent a decrease of approximately 41 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 100 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves partially offset by a 52 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in luxembourg and france earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 14 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 some of these provisions provided retroactive changes to the 2012 tax year which were not taken into account in determining the company’s effective tax rate for 2012 the impact of these retroactive changes was approximately 76 million of lower tax expense and was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 earnings per share of common stock—assuming dilution increased by 123 per share in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower pension expense mainly due to a decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment increased segment profit in each of our business segments and higher other income as discussed above partially offset by increased tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges 

earnings per share of common stock—assuming dilution increased by 108 per share in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower pension expense mainly due to a decrease in the pension marktomarket adjustment increased segment profit in our aerospace automation and control solutions and performance materials and technologies segments lower repositioning and other charges partially offset by increased tax expense decreased income from discontinued operations and higher other postretirement expense

 aerospace 

  aerospace sales by major customer endmarkets were as follows 

 2013 compared with 2012 

aerospace sales were flat in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to favorable pricing increased volumes in our commercial original equipment oe business and increased licensing revenue primarily due to a royalty gain in the fourth quarter offset by decreased volumes in our defense and space and commercial aftermarket businesses and an increase in payments due to business and general aviation and air transport and regional oe manufacturers to partially offset their preproduction costs associated with new aircraft platforms oem payments 

details regarding the changes in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

commercial original equipment oe sales increased by 3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 

 commercial aftermarket sales increased by 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 

 defense and space sales decreased by 5 percent in 2013 primarily due to us government program ramp downs and lower defense budget partially offset by a royalty gain in the fourth quarter 

aerospace segment profit increased by 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth as discussed above including favorable pricing and productivity net of inflation partially offset by lower defense and space sales as discussed above the segment margin impact from other factors was flat which reflects the net effect of a royalty gain in the fourth quarter offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in oem payments cost of products and services sold totaled 88 billion in 2013 a decrease of approximately 101 million from 2012 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above excluding price 

2012 compared with 2011 

aerospace sales increased by 5 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 3 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume a 1 percent increase from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 1 percent increase in revenue related to an 88 million reduction in payments to business and general aviation oe manufacturers to partially offset their preproduction costs associated with new aircraft platforms oem payments 

details regarding the changes in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

commercial original equipment oe sales increased by 19 percent 12 percent organic in 2012 compared to 2011 

 commercial aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 

 36 

defense and space sales decreased by 3 percent negative 4 percent organic in 2012 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs partially offset by higher international aftermarket sales and growth from acquisitions net of divestitures 

aerospace segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 8 percent a 4 percent favorable impact from lower oem payments discussed above and a 1 percent increase from acquisitions net of divestitures the increase in operational segment profit is due to the favorable impact from higher price and productivity net of inflation and commercial demand partially offset by increased research development and engineering investments cost of products and services sold totaled 90 billion in 2012 an increase of approximately 324 million from 2011 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above excluding price

repositioning and other charges 

see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2013 2012 and 2011 our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 150 million in 2014 compared with 2013 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 160 136 and 159 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to be approximately 175 million in 2014 and will be funded through operating cash flows 

the following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 are summarized as follows 

 2013 compared with 2012 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 818 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to i reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of 883 million ii a 447 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment iii a 135 million favorable impact from working capital driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately 352 million and a 260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges most significantly the narco trust establishment payments of 164 million 

cash used for investing activities increased by 531 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 695 million most significantly intermec and rae partially offset by an increase of approximately 190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 773 million during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of 1462 million partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of 651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of 142 million 

2012 compared with 2011 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 684 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of 706 million and a 342 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately 340 million 

cash used for investing activities increased by 817 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to i a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses of 1135 million most significantly the divestiture of the consumer products group business and the automotive onboard sensor products business within our automation and control solutions segment in 2011 ii a net 117 million increase in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities and iii an increase in expenditures for property plant and equipment of 86 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 535 million

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives the company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables at december 31 2013 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or suppliers’ ability to obtain financing particularly in our longcycle businesses and airline automotive and refiningpetrochemical end markets customer or supplier bankruptcies delays in their ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations to date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues we continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions there was 1299 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2013 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties as of december 31 2013 and 2012 none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties when we sell receivables they are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the terms of the trade accounts receivable 

program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion providing us with an additional source of revolving credit as a result program receivables remain on the company’s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as shortterm borrowings 

in march 2013 the company repaid 600 million of its 425 percent notes 

in november 2013 the company issued 300 million 335 percent senior notes due 2023 and 700 million floating rate senior notes due 2015 collectively the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 1 billion offset by 7 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering 

on december 10 2013 the company entered into a 4 billion amended and restated five year credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed 45 billion the credit agreement contains a 700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous 3 billion five year credit agreement dated april 2 2012 “prior agreement” there have been no borrowings under the credit agreement or the prior agreement 

during 2013 the company repurchased 1073 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans see part ii item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 in december 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 5 billion of honeywell common stock 

on june 3 2013 the company acquired rae a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems and software the aggregate value net of cash acquired was 338 million the acquisition was funded with available cash see acquisitions in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

on september 17 2013 the company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of intermec a leading provider of mobile computing radio frequency identification solutions and bar code label and receipt printers for use in warehousing supply chain field service and manufacturing environments intermec was a us public company that operated globally and had reported 2012 revenues of 790 million the aggregate value net of cash acquired was 607 million the acquisition was funded with the issuance of commercial paper see acquisitions in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

in january 2014 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its friction materials business to federal mogul corporation for approximately 155 million the transaction subject to required regulatory approvals and applicable information and consultation requirements is expected to close in the second half of 2014 see divestitures in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

in 2013 we were not required to make contributions to our us pension plans during 2013 cash contributions of 156 million were made to our nonus plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

the narco plan of reorganization went into effect on april 30 2013 in 2013 the company made narco trust establishment payments of 164 million see asbestos matters in note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2014 related to the narco trust 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2014 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2013 and 2012 we realized 3 and 21 million respectively in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2013 

 

  

 the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations in 2014 we are not required to make contributions to our us pension plans however we plan to make contributions of cash andor marketable securities of approximately 150 million 117 million of marketable securities were contributed in january 2014 to our nonus plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards the timing and amount of contributions to both our us and nonus plans may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2014 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying 

asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 130 million in 2014 net of the benefit of approximately 11 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 23 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

the noncontrolling interest shareholder of uop russell llc formerly thomas russell co one of our subsidiaries has put rights that may be exercised causing us to purchase their equity interests beginning january 1 2016 through december 31 2016 the same interest is subject to certain call rights by the company as the amount paid is based on operating income performance from 2013 to 2015 the actual settlement amount may be different and has therefore been excluded from this table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2013 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the 

range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 272 234 and 240 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively at december 31 2013 and 2012 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 643 and 654 million respectively in addition in 2013 and 2012 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 88 and 84 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 304 320 and 270 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 300 million in 2014 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro canadian dollar british pound mexican peso indian rupee chinese renminbi czech koruna hong kong dollar korean won singapore dollar swiss franc united arab emirates dirham swedish krona thai baht and romanian leu 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in note 14 longterm debt and credit agreements and note 16 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and 

commodity prices we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2013 and 2012 

 

  

 the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2013 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 summary of significant accounting policies and 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018 as described in note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524g trust as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims from january 2002 through the effective date of the narco trust on april 30 2013 we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years we will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of 

probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees 

we recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year mtm adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets this accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 51 957 and 1802 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the remaining components of pension incomeexpense primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis pension ongoing income expense 

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension incomeexpense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 23 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year information on all our significant actuarial assumptions is included in note 23 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2013 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 489 percent discount rate in 2014 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2012 we plan to continue to 

use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 percent for 2014 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing income expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 230 million in 2014 compared with pension ongoing income of 90 million in 2013 the increase in pension ongoing income in 2014 compared with 2013 results primarily from an increase in the plans’ assets at december 31 2013 compared with december 31 2012 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2013 also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2014 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans and did not make a contribution to our us plans during 2013 however we made voluntary contributions of 792 and 1650 million to our us pension plans in 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets in 2014 we are not required to make contributions to our us pension plans we plan to make contributions of cash andor marketable securities of approximately 150 million 117 million of marketable securities were contributed in january 2014 to our nonus plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards the timing and amount of contributions to both our us and non us plans may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans 

longlived assets including tangible and finitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and finitelived intangible assets at december 31 2013 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled approximately 71 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 55 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in note 16 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to the financial statements we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 72 million in 2013 principally related to property plant and equipment and 22 million and 2012 principally related to property plant and equipment and intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks acquired in business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances of 130 billion and 725 million respectively as of december 31 2013 are subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value in testing goodwill the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2013 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of that date however significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair values in the future 

income taxes —deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2013 we recorded a net deferred tax asset of 1004 million that is comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods we maintain a valuation allowance of 614 million to offset a portion of this nonus net deferred tax asset the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our 

volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 1004 million consists of 19 million related to us operations and 985 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 19 million consists of federal and state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards reduced by net taxable temporary differences the nonus net deferred tax asset of 985 million consists principally of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards mainly in canada france luxembourg netherlands and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 614 million against a portion of the nonus net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance maintained against these deferred tax assets reflects our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance increased by 16 million in 2013 increased by 7 million in 2012 and decreased by 45 million in 2011 in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional reserves for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold the approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2013 we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and performance materials and technologies segments these long term contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

 aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 32 31 and 33 percent of our total sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7 6 and 6 percent of our total sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4109 4276 and 4354 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3273 3374 and 3500 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively base us defense spending excludes overseas contingent operations was essentially flat in 2012 compared to 2011 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations due to anticipated lower us government spending levels mandated by the budget control act sequestration we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2013 we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2013 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the 

government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales as well as our diversified commercial businesses our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 16807 and 16160 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 12102 million of the 2012 backlog will be filled in 2013 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion

sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and australia 

the company and its subsidiaries have a current policy not to conduct business with iran pursuant to section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 we note the following in 2009 honeywell acquired rmg group “rmg” a german company that had a preexisting contract with an iranian entity for the supply and installation of compressed natural gas refueling stations in iran the rmg contract was entered into and performed by a foreign entity and did not involve the development of natural gas resources or pipelines and we believe that it was not prohibited by or sanctionable under applicable laws in july 2011 rmg assigned performance under the contract to an unaffiliated italian company during the first quarter of 2012 the unaffiliated italian company performed some services under the contract however since the iranian customer failed to make required payments the unaffiliated italian company has performed no work under the assigned contract since the first quarter of 2012 the company does not intend to perform any further services under this contract in accordance with company policy and applicable laws no gross revenues or net profits have been received by the company under this contract from iran in 2012 additionally a nonus affiliate of honeywell received 1120000 representing net profit of 400000 recognized in a prior period during 2012 for services performed and  or goods delivered in or prior to the first quarter of 2011 in connection with automation engineering services contracts entered into in 2009 involving iran these contracts were also entered into and performed by nonus entities and we believe that the contracts and their performance were not prohibited by or sanctionable under laws applicable at the time honeywell’s italian affiliate transferred its remaining obligations to an unaffiliated company based in dubai in the fourth quarter of 2010 honeywell has not performed any services or provided any materials under these contracts after the first quarter of 2011 and it does not intend to provide any further services or materials under these contracts in accordance with company policy and applicable laws ofac issued a general license in 31 cfr § 560555 valid from october 9 2012 to march 8 2013 which permits transactions ordinarily incident to the winddown of operations involving iran by foreign subsidiaries of us companies honeywell’s nonus affiliate in italy received payments of 187000 out of a total of 1120000 received in 2012 during the validity period of the general license to honeywell’s knowledge neither it nor any of its affiliates engaged in any other activity during 2012 required to be disclosed under the securities exchange act of 1934 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 25 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2012 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to r240 a key component in foam blowing agents a raw material used in our performance materials and technologies segment 

the costs of certain key raw materials including cumene fluorspar perchloroethylene r240 natural gas sulfur and ethylene in our performance materials and technologies business nickel steel and other metals in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2013 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection 

agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2013 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion inventory levels in distribution channels and global economic growth rates performance materials and technologies’ operating results which generated 16 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion and raw material demand and supply volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012 are impacted by global production and demand for 

automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors including ability of consumers to obtain financing ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and non material inflation 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our performance materials and technologies cumene fluorspar perchloroethylene r240 natural gas sulfur and ethylene transportation systems nickel steel and other metals and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers’ decisions to exit certain businesses bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes eg product certification or stewardship requirements sourcing restrictions product authenticity climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards etc our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to among other things fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations result in personal injury or property damage damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts the same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by honeywell to large industrial refining and petrochemical customers 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 

we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company andor its third party service providers while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india the middle east and other high growth regions 

in 2012 approximately 55 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and sold outside the us as well as products manufactured in international locations were outside of the us including approximately 28 percent in europe and approximately 13 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability acts of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions we are also subject to us laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

uncertain global economic conditions arising from circumstances such as sovereign debt issues slowing growth in emerging regions and credit rating downgrades in certain european countries or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the euro zone could result in reduced customer confidence resulting in decreased demand for our products and services disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates a tightening of credit markets see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion increased risk regarding supplier performance increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with which we do business and exchange rate fluctuations while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials as a result our operating margins may be negatively impacted fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our nonus businesses are translated into us dollars while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2012 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 199 billion and 05 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for 

sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospace’s defense and space sales and results of operations 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 27 and 9 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2012 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2013 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract requirements complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for frequent design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to various government audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government 

also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees vendors agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees vendors agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition data privacy and rights of employees any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions fuel economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health safety and environmental matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property antitrust import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be 

prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits 

with approximately 132000 employees including approximately 52000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs legislative or regulatory changes and volatility in discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our us pension plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense including discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan 

accounting policies see “critical accounting policies” included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2012 our tax expense represented 244 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures

executive summary 

for honeywell 2012 marked another year of strong growth despite a challenging political and macroeconomic environment the company continued to manage uncertainty associated with slower than expected economic growth in the united states recession in the european union political unrest in the middle east and slowing growth in china and other emerging economies despite a modest 26 percent growth in world gdp and industrial production honeywell’s 2012 revenues were 377 billion representing a 3 percent improvement compared to 2011 revenues of 365 billion honeywell’s 2012 revenue growth was achieved despite significant foreign exchange weakness in the euro and other nonus dollar currencies which had a negative 2 percent impact on our 2012 revenues our segment profit improved by 10 percent in excess of three times revenue growth evidencing the company’s continued focus on operational excellence see review of business segments section of this mda for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes 

the company’s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive efficiency and service quality bringing worldclass products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers honeywell refers to these processes as the honeywell enablers in 2012 honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the honeywell enablers 

 the company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics 

 25 

 operating cash flow grew by 24 percent in 2012 to 3517 million this operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest 884 million in capital expenditures fund the acquisitions discussed above make 1039 million in pension contributions and provide an 11 percent increase in dividends paid vs 2011 and repurchase 5 million shares of common stock

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended 2012 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows 

 2012 compared with 2011 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 684 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of 706 million and a 344 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately 340 million 

cash used for investing activities increased by 817 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to i a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses of 1135 million most significantly the divestiture of the consumer products group business and the automotive onboard sensor products business within our automation and control solutions segment in 2011 ii a net 117 million increase in investments primarily shortterm marketable securities and iii an increase in expenditures for property plant and equipment of 86 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 535 million 

cash used for financing activities increased by 92 million during 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of 825 million and an increase in dividends paid of 120 million partially offset by a decrease of 806 million in net repurchases of common stock and a decrease of 33 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives the company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables at december 31 2012 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 400 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2012 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2012 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties as of december 31 2012 and 2011 none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties when we sell receivables they are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion providing us with an additional source of revolving credit as a result program receivables remain on the company’s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as shortterm borrowings 

on april 2 2012 the company entered into a 3000 million amended and restated five year credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed 3500 million the credit agreement contains a 700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous 2800 million five year credit agreement dated march 31 2011 “prior agreement” there have been no borrowings under the credit agreement or the prior agreement 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or suppliers’ ability to obtain financing particularly in our longcycle businesses and airline automotive and refiningpetrochemical end markets customer or supplier bankruptcies delays in their ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations to date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues we continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure 

in february 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 3 billion of honeywell common stock during 2012 the company repurchased 317 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including future option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans see part ii item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2012 

on october 22 2012 the company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in thomas russell co a privatelyheld leading provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating for approximately 525 million 368 million net of cash thomas russell co’s results of operations have been consolidated into the performance materials and technologies segment with the noncontrolling interest portion reflected in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of operations during the calendar year 2016 honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of thomas russell co’s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015 subject to a predetermined cap and floor additionally honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on or before december 31 2015 see note 21 redeemable noncontrolling interest 

in december 2012 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire intermec inc intermec a leading provider of mobile computing radio frequency identification solutions rfid and bar code label and receipt printers for use in warehousing supply chain field service and manufacturing environments for 10 per share in cash or an aggregate purchase price of approximately 600 million net of cash acquired intermec is a us public company which operates globally and had reported 2011 revenues of approximately 850 million the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013 pending intermec shareholder approval and following customary regulatory reviews the acquisition is expected to be funded with available cash and the issuance of commercial paper intermec will be integrated into our automation and control solutions segment 

during 2012 the company made cash contributions of 1039 million principally to improve the funded status of our pension plans 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures dividends strategic acquisitions share repurchases employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2013 to be as follows 

 45 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2012 and 2011 we realized 21 and 1156 million respectively in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2012 

 

  

 47 

the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations in 2013 we are not required to make contributions to our us pension plans however we plan to make cash contributions of approximately 150 million 113 million was made in january 2013 to our nonus plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2013 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 149 million in 2013 net of the benefit of approximately 11 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 23 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

the noncontrolling interest shareholder of thomas russell co one of our subsidiaries has put rights that may be exercised causing us to purchase their equity interests beginning january 1 2016 through december 31 2016 the same interest is subject to certain call rights by the company as the amount paid is based on operating income performance from 2013 to 2015 the actual settlement amount may be different and has therefore been excluded from this table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2012 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the 

financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 234 240 and 225 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2012 and 2011 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 654 and 723 million respectively in addition in 2012 and 2011 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 84 and 102 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 320 270 and 266 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 300 million in 2013 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi mexican peso indian rupee korean won czech koruna hong kong dollar singapore dollar romanian leu swiss franc swedish krona and thai baht 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in note 14 longterm debt and credit agreements and note 16 financial instruments and fair value measures of notes to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

  

 the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2012 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 summary of significant accounting policies and 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018 as described in note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524g trust as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims since january 2002 we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years we will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for 

these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 22 commitments and contingencies of notes to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans —we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees 

we recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year mtm adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm charges were 957 1802 and 471 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the remaining components of pension incomeexpense primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis pension ongoing incomeexpense 

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension incomeexpense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 23 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in note 23 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2012 2011 and 2010 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 52 

the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 406 percent discount rate in 2013 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2011 we will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 percent for 2013 down from 8 percent in 2012 due to lower future expected market returns 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to range from 50 to 75 million in 2013 compared with ongoing pension expense of 36 million in 2012 the increase in pension ongoing income in 2013 compared with 2012 results primarily from an increase in the plans’ assets at december 31 2012 compared with december 31 2011 due to contributions and strong asset returns in 2012 also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2013 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 792 1650 and 1000 million to our us pension plans in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which has been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets in 2013 we are not required to make contributions to our us pension plans however we plan to make cash contributions of approximately 150 million 113 million was made in january 2013 to our nonus plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards the timing and amount of contributions to both our us and nonus plans may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans 

longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2012 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled approximately 67 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 53 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in note 16 to the financial statements we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 22 million and 127 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks acquired in business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances of 124 billion and 725 million respectively as of december 31 2012 are subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value in testing goodwill the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2012 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of that date however significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair values 

income taxes —deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2012 we recorded a net deferred tax asset of 2473 million less a valuation allowance of 598 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 2473 million consists of 1422 million related to us operations and 1051 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1422 million consists of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies the nonus net deferred tax asset of 1051 million consists principally of net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards mainly in canada france germany luxembourg netherlands and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 598 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance increased by 7 million in 2012 decreased by 45 million in 2011 and increased by 58 million in 2010 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional reserves for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold the approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2012 we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and performance materials and technologies segments these long term contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

our total backlog at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 16160 and 14616 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 12018 million of the 2011 backlog will be filled in 2012 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development globally us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 12 11 and 12 percent of our total sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe and asia were 43 42 and 40 percent of our total sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

approximately 18 percent of total 2011 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe asia canada and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2011 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada and asia 

approximately 3 percent of total 2011 sales of automation and control solutions products and services were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2011 automation and control solutions sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe and asia with less significant operations in canada and australia 

approximately 34 percent of total 2011 sales of performance materials and technologies products and services were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 25 percent of total 2011 performance materials and technologies sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia 

approximately 3 percent of total 2011 sales of transportation systems products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products accounted for 85 percent of total 2011 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and latin america

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2011 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material 

amount of our raw materials except related to r240 a key component in foam blowing agents a raw material used in our performance materials and technologies segment 

the costs of certain key raw materials including cumene fluorspar perchloroethylene r240 natural gas sulfur and ethylene in our performance materials and technologies business nickel steel and other metals in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to remain volatile we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2012 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell aclar ademco bendix bw callidus enovate esser firelite garrett genetron gent howard leight jurid matrikon maxon mk north notifier novar rmg silent knight spectra system sensor trend tridium and uop 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us india europe and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1799 1450 and 1321 million in 2011 2010 and 2009  respectively the increase in rd expense of 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our aerospace segment the development of turbocharging systems for new diesel and gas applications in our transportation systems segment and new product development in our automation and control solutions segment the increase in rd expense of 10 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions and increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms rd as a percentage of sales was 49 45 and 44 percent in 2011 2010 and 2009  respectively customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 867 874 and 852 million in 2011 2010 and 2009  respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict 

environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors”

risk factors 

tableend cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2012 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 31 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 43 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion inventory levels in distribution channels and global economic growth rates performance materials and technologies’ operating results which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion and raw material demand and supply volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors including ability of consumers to obtain financing ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and nonmaterial inflation 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our performance materials and technologies cumene fluorspar perchloroethylene r240 natural gas sulfur and ethylene transportation systems nickel steel and other metals and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers’ decisions to exit certain businesses bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes eg product certification or stewardship requirements sourcing restrictions product authenticity climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards etc our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to among other things fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations result in personal injury or property damage damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts the same risk can also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by honeywell to large industrial refining and petrochemical customers 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 

we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged invalidated or infringed 

upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats while we employ comprehensive measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india the middle east and other high growth regions 

in 2011 approximately 55 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and sold outside the us as well as products manufactured in international locations were outside of the us including approximately 30 percent in europe and approximately 12 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions we are also subject to us laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

uncertain global economic conditions arising from circumstances such as sovereign debt issues and credit rating downgrades in certain european countries or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the euro zone could result in reduced customer confidence resulting in decreased demand for our products and services disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates a tightening of credit markets see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion increased risk regarding supplier performance increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with which we do business and exchange rate fluctuations while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials as a result our operating margins may be negatively impacted fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our nonus businesses are translated into us dollars while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2011 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 191 billion and 04 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospace’s defense and space sales and results of operations 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 29 and 9 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2011 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2012 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract requirements complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for frequent design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to various government audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations when appropriate and prudent we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus 

termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition and data privacy any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations performance materials and technologies’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health safety and environmental matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or 

settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits 

with approximately 132000 employees including approximately 53000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs legislative or regulatory changes and volatility in discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our us pension plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense including discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see “critical accounting policies” included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2011 our tax expense represented 183 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

  cost of products and services sold 

 cost of products and services sold increased by 3835 million or 16 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs labor costs and indirect costs of approximately 2 billion 520 million and 280 million respectively driven substantially by a 13 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors excluding price discussed above and in the review of business segments section of this mda an increase in pension and other postretirement expense of approximately 880 million primarily driven by the increase in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of goods sold of 11 billion and an increase in repositioning and other charges of approximately 90 million 

gross margin percentage decreased by 18 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement expense approximate 28 percentage point impact primarily driven by an unfavorable 33 percentage point impact resulting from the increase in the pension marktomarket adjustment allocated to cost of goods sold and repositioning and other charges approximate 02 percentage point impact 

partially offset by higher sales volume driven by each of our business segments approximate 12 percentage point impact 

cost of products and services sold increased by 1461 million or 6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs and indirect costs of approximately 1250 million and 300 million respectively driven substantially by an 8 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors discussed above and in the review of business segments section of this mda and approximately 130 million increase in repositioning and other charges see note 3 of notes to financial statements partially offset by a 300 million decrease in pension expense 

gross margin percentage increased by 13 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower pension expense approximate 1 percentage point impact and higher sales volume driven by our automation and control solutions segment performance materials and technologies segment and transportation systems segment approximate 07 percentage point impact partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges approximate 05 percentage point impact 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga increased as a percentage of sales by 05 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by an estimated 430 million increase in labor costs resulting from acquisitions investment for growth and merit increases an estimated increase of 240 million in pension and other postretirement expense driven primarily by the allocated portion of the pension marktomarket charge increase of approximately 270 million and an estimated increase of 60 million in repositioning actions partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume as a result of the factors discussed in the review of business segments section of this mda 

selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased as a percentage of sales by 01 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by the impact of higher sales volume discussed above and lower pension expense partially offset by an estimated 500 million increase in labor costs reflecting the absence of prior period labor cost actions 

 other income decreased by 13 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a 29 million loss resulting from early redemption of debt in the first quarter of 2011 included within “other net” and the absence of a 62 million pretax gain related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our performance materials and technologies segment in the third quarter of 2010 included within “other net” see note 4 of notes to financial statements for further details partially offset by a 61 million increase in gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets due primarily to a 50 million pretax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive onboard sensors products business within our automation and control solutions segment and the reduction of approximately 12 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2010 included within “other net” 

other income increased by 43 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the consolidation of a joint venture resulting in a 62 million pretax gain within our performance materials and technologies segment in the third quarter of 2010 included in “other net” see note 4 of notes to financial statements for further details 

the absence of an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 62 million in the second quarter of 2009 included within “other net” partially offset by the absence of a 50 million deconsolidation gain related to a subsidiary within our automation and control solutions segment in 2009 included within “gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets” and 22 million of acquisition related costs in 2010 included within “other net” 

   

interest and other financial charges decreased by 3 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower borrowing costs partially offset by higher debt balances 

interest and other financial charges decreased by 16 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to lower debt balances and lower borrowing costs 

  tax expense 

 the effective tax rate decreased by 98 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings between us and foreign related to higher us pension expense primarily driven by an approixmate 76 percentage point impact which resulted from the increase in pension marktomarket expense an increased benefit from manufacturing incentives an increased benefit from the favorable settlement of tax audits and an increased benefit from a lower foreign effective tax rate the foreign effective tax rate was 211 percent a decrease of approximately 49 percentage points which primarily consisted of i a 51 percent impact from decreased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to an increase in german earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards ii a 24 percent impact from tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses iii a 12 percent impact from an increased benefit in tax credits and lower statutory tax rates and iv a 41 percent impact related to an increase in tax reserves the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates 

the effective tax rate increased by 59 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower us pension expense the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the medicare part d program the absence of manufacturing incentives a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate the foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii a 01 percentage points impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates 

in 2012 the effective tax rate could change based upon the company’s operating results mix of earnings and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved 

 earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased by 002 per share in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in segment profit in each of our business segments lower tax expense the gain on disposal of discontinued operations and lower other postretirement expense partially offset by higher pension expense primarily due to an increase in the pension marktomarket adjustment and higher repositioning and other charges 

earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased by 054 per share in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased segment profit in our automation and control solutions performance materials and technologies and transportation systems segments and lower pension expense partially offset by higher tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges

  economic and other factors 

aerospace operating results are principally driven by 

   aerospace sales by major customer endmarkets were as follows 

   2011 compared with 2010 

aerospace sales increased by 7 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 7 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume 

 aerospace segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 9 percent and an increase of 1 percent due to lower oem payments made during 2011 the increase in operational segment profit is comprised of the positive impact from higher commercial aftermarket demand price and productivity net of inflation partially offset by research development and engineering investments cost of goods sold totaled 87 billion in 2011 an increase of approximately 566 million from 2010 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above 

2010 compared with 2009 

aerospace sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 1 percent reduction of revenue related to amounts recognized for payments to business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers to partially offset their preproduction costs associated with new aircraft platforms oem payments 

details regarding the decrease in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

 aerospace segment profit decreased by 3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a negative 3 percent impact from the oem payments discussed above operational segment profit was flat in 2010 with the approximate positive 4 percent impact from price and productivity net of inflation including the absence of prior period labor cost actions offset by the benefits from prior repositioning actions offset by an approximate negative 4 percent impact from lower sales volume cost of goods sold totaled 81 billion in 2010 unchanged from 2009

acs’s operating results are principally driven by 

 35 

    2011 compared with 2010 

automation and control solutions “acs” sales increased by 13 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a 6 percent growth from acquisitions net of divestitures 5 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and higher prices and 2 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange through the first nine months partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter we expect sales growth to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to european economic conditions and the anticipated negative impact of foreign exchange 

 acs segment profit increased by 18 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit 6 percent increase from acquisitions net of divestitures and 3 percent positive impact of foreign exchange the increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 5 percent positive impact from price and productivity net of inflation and investment for growth and a 4 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes cost of goods sold totaled 104 billion in 2011 an increase of approximately 11 billion which is primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures higher sales volume foreign exchange and inflation partially offset by positive impact from productivity

   2011 compared with 2010 

transportation systems sales increased by 21 percent in 2011 compared with the 2010 primarily due to a 16 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and a favorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 percent 

the sales increase in 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily driven by i increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers primarily due to new platform launches and strong diesel penetration rates in western europe and ii the favorable impact of foreign exchange we expect turbocharger year over year sales growth rate to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to reduced european light vehicle production and the anticipated negative impact of foreign exchange 

transportation systems segment profit increased by 37 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 32 percent increase in operational segment profit and a 5 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange the increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 25 percent positive impact from productivity net of inflation and price and 7 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes cost of goods sold totaled 32 billion in 2011 an increase of 533 million which is primarily a result of higher sales volume foreign exchange and inflation partially offset by positive impact from productivity 

  2010 compared with 2009 

transportation systems sales increased by 31 percent in 2010 compared with the 2009 primarily due to a 33 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2 percent 

the sales increase in 2010 as compared with 2009 was primarily due to increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange 

transportation systems segment profit increased by 292 million in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to the positive impact from increased sales volume cost of goods sold totaled 26 billion in 2010 an increase of approximately 450 million which is also primarily a result of increased sales volume 

 repositioning and other charges 

see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2011 2010 and 2009 our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 150 million in 2012 compared with 2011 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 159 147 and 193 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to be approximately 150 million in 2012 and will be funded through operating cash flows 

the following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment 

 liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended 2011 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows 

 2011 compared with 2010 

cash provided by operating activities decreased by 1370 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to i increased voluntary cash contributions of 1050 million to our us pension plans ii an unfavorable impact from decreased deferred taxes excluding the impact of cash taxes of approximately 710 million and iii higher cash tax payments of approximately 500 million partially offset by an 863 million increase of net income before the noncash pension marktomarket adjustment 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 1658 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sale of businesses of 1149 million most significantly the divestiture of the consumer products group business and the automotive onboard sensor products business within our automation and control solutions segment a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 330 million and a net 315 million decrease in investments of shortterm marketable securities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 933 million during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt of 1734 million and a decrease of 293 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions partially offset by an increase of 1085 million of repurchases of common stock 

2010 compared with 2009 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 257 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to i increased accrued expenses of 690 million due to increased customer advances and incentive compensation accruals ii a 550 million impact from increased deferred taxes excluding the impact of cash taxes iii increased net income of 474 million iv lower cash tax payments of approximately 300 million and v a 219 million decrease in payments for repositioning and other charges partially offset by a i 1059 unfavorable impact from working capital driven by higher receivables and increased purchases of raw materials and component inventory to support higher demand partially offset by a corresponding increase to accounts payable ii increased pension and other postretirement payments of 598 million and iii the absence of 155 million sale of longterm receivables in 2009 

cash used for investing activities increased by 1136 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 835 million most significantly sperian protection and a net 341 million increase in investments in shortterm marketable securities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 105 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a decrease in the net repayment of debt including commercial paper of 287 million and an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 158 million partially offset by the repayment of 326 million of debt assumed in the acquisition of sperian protection 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth margin expansion and improved working capital turnover considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies including the focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives the company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables at december 31 2011 a substantial portion of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries if the amounts held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current 

law they would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 599 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2011 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2011 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties as of december 31 2011 and 2010 none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties when we sell receivables they are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion providing us with an additional source of revolving credit as a result program receivables remain on the company’s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either shortterm borrowings or longterm debt 

in february 2011 the company issued 800 million 425 senior notes due 2021 and 600 million 5375 senior notes due 2041 collectively the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 1400 million offset by 19 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering 

in the first quarter of 2011 the company repurchased the entire outstanding principal amount of its 400 million 5625 notes due 2012 via a cash tender offer and a subsequent optional redemption the costs relating to the early redemption of the notes including the “makewhole premium” was 29 million 

in march 2011 the company entered into a 2800 million five year credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed 3500 million the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper and replaces the previous 2800 million five year credit agreement dated may 14 2007 “prior agreement” at december 31 2011 there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility the credit facility does not restrict honeywell’s ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company repaid 500 million of its 6125 notes at maturity the repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or suppliers’ ability to obtain financing particularly in our longcycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets customer or supplier bankruptcies delays in their ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations to date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues we continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure 

in february 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 3 billion of honeywell common stock during 2011 the company repurchased 1085 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans including future option exercises restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans see part ii item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011 

in july 2011 the company sold its consumer products group business cpg to rank group limited the sale was completed for approximately 955 million in cash proceeds resulting in a pretax gain of approximately 301 million and a pproximately 178 million net of tax the gain was recorded in net income from discontinued operations after taxes in the company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the discontinued operations is insignificant the sale of cpg which had been part of the transportation systems segment is consistent with the company’s strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies see acquisitions and divestitures in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

in august 2011 the company completed the acquisition of ems a leading provider of connectivity solutions for mobile networking rugged mobile computers and satellite communications the aggregate value net of cash acquired was approximately 513 million see acquisitions and divestitures in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

in december 2011 the company acquired king’s safetywear limited ksw a leading international provider of branded safety footwear the aggregate value net of cash acquired was approximately 331 million including the assumption of debt of 33 million see acquisitions and divestitures in note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion 

during 2011 the company made voluntary cash contributions to its us pension plans of 1650 million to improve the funded status of our plans 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2012 to be as follows 

 45 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2011 we realized 1156 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2011 

  46 

 the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations in 2012 we plan to make cash contributions of 800 million to 1 billion 250 million was made in january 2012 to our plans to improve the funded status of the plans these contributions principally consist of voluntary contributions to our us plans the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2012 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 167 million in 2012 net of the benefit of approximately 13 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually o r jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 240 225 and 151 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively at december 31 2011 and 2010 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 723 and 753 million respectively in addition in 2011 and 2010 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 102 and 86 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 270 266 and 318 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 300 million in 2012 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso swiss franc czech koruna chinese renminbi indian rupee singapore dollar swedish krona korean won and thai baht 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2011 and 2010 

  the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2011 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements 

  contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

  asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco its former parent company and certain asbestos claimants and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018 as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524g trust as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims since january 2002 we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates disease classifications and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years in light of the uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years we will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to 

various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

  defined benefit pension plans — we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year mtm adjustment net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm adjustments were 1802 471 and 741 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis ongoing pension expense 

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2011 2010 and 2009 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 489 percent discount rate in 2012 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2010 we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8 percent for 2012 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan’s investments 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future ongoing pension expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 ongoing pension expense for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 60 million in 2012 a decrease of 45 million from 2011 due primarily to the impact of planned cash contributions in 2012 also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2012 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 1650 1000 and 740 million to our us pension plans in 2011 2010 and 2009  respectively primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which has been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets in 2012 we plan to make cash contributions of 800 million to 1 billion 250 million was made in january 2012 to our plans to improve the funded status of the plans these contributions principally consist of voluntary contributions to our us plans the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans 

  longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2011 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled approximately 65 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in note 16 to the financial statements we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 127 million and 30 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized 

goodwill impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 119 billion as of december 31 2011 is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2011 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date however significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

income taxes— deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2011 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 2421 million less a valuation allowance of 591 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 2421 million consists of 1516 million related to us operations and 905 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1516 million consists of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards federal and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 5 million against such asset related to state net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 905 million consists principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in france netherlands luxembourg and germany we maintain a valuation allowance of 588 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance decreased by 45 million in 2011 and increased by 58 million and 133 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional reserves for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold the approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually 

assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2011 we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and performance materials and technologies segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

 aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 32 35 and 35 percent of our total sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 6 7 and 9 percent of our total sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 10 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4354 4288 and 4240 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3500 3455 and 3412 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively us defense spending increased in 2010 although we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2011 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2011 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 14616 and 13182 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 10609 million of the 2010 backlog will be filled in 2011 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe asia canada middle east and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 11 12 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 41 39 and 39 percent of our total sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

approximately 17 percent of total 2010 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe canada asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2010 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada and asia 

approximately 2 percent of total 2010 sales of automation and control solutions products and services were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2010 automation and control solutions sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

approximately 30 percent of total 2010 sales of specialty materials products and services were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 27 percent of total 2010 specialty materials sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

approximately 3 percent of total 2010 sales of transportation systems products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products accounted for 70 percent of total 2010 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and latin america 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2010 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier 

the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas benzene the key component in phenol ethylene fluorspar and sulfur in our specialty materials business steel nickel other metals and ethylene glycol in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to remain volatile in addition in 2010 certain large longterm fixed supplier price agreements expired primarily relating to components used by our aerospace business which in the aggregate subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2011 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future furthermore the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality andor delivery commitments to us due to bankruptcy natural disasters or any other reason may result in significant costs and delay including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory agencies 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell aclar ademco autolite bendix enovate firelite fram garrett hand held holts jurid metrologic mk north notifier novar prestone redex rmg simoniz spectra system sensor and uop 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products the company’s principal research and development activities are in the us europe india and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1466 1330 and 1543 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in rd expense of 10 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to 

additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions and increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms the decrease in rd expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales rd as a percentage of sales was 44 43 and 42 percent in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 874 852 and 903 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area 

further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors”

risk factors 

tableend cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2011 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion inventory levels in distribution channels and global economic growth rates specialty materials’ operating results which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion and commodity demand volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors including ability of consumers to obtain financing ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and nonmaterial inflation 

raw material price fluctuations the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials benzene the key component in phenol natural gas ethylene fluorspar and sulfur transportation systems nickel steel other metals and ethylene glycol and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers’ decisions to exit certain businesses and by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes eg product certification or stewardship requirements sourcing restrictions climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards etc our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to among other things fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations result in personal injury or property damage damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts the same risk can also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by honeywell to large industrial refining and petrochemical customers 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 

we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other 

intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

our systems are subject to risks from unlawful attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems through the internet the theft andor unauthorized use or production of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the value of our investment in rd and product development and could subject us to claims by third parties relating to loss of their confidential or proprietary information 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as mexico brazil china india malaysia the middle east and eastern europe 

in 2010 52 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and in international locations were outside of the us including 28 percent in europe and 11 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions we are also subject to us laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

as we continue to grow our businesses internationally our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the european and asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2010 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 190 billion and 03 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospace’s defense and space sales and results of operations 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 33 and 10 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2010 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition and data privacy any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health safety and environmental matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits 

with approximately 130000 employees including approximately 53000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs legislative or regulatory changes and volatility in discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our us pension plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense including discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see “critical accounting policies” included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2010 our tax expense represented 284 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business

environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 

although the outcome of the matters discussed below cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that any of them individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows 

the united states environmental protection agency and the united states department of justice “federal authorities” are investigating whether the storage of certain sludges generated during uranium hexafluoride production at our metropolis illinois facility has been in compliance with the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act the federal authorities have convened a grand jury in this matter the company has cooperated fully in the investigation and has been engaged in discussions with the federal authorities regarding a resolution of this matter which the company expects to finalize in the first quarter of 2011 the storage issue at the metropolis site was also previously voluntarily disclosed to the illinois environmental protection agency with whom honeywell has been working to resolve related civil environmental claims 

in november 2010 honeywell reached a final settlement agreement with the new york state department of environmental conservation to settle allegations that honeywell failed to properly close out waste storage areas associated with legacy operations in syracuse new york which areas are known as the solvay settling basins under the terms of the settlement honeywell will pay a fine of 100000 and implement certain environmental projects in the area 

the united states environmental protection agency and the united states department of justice are investigating whether the company’s manufacturing facility in hopewell virginia is in compliance with the requirements of the clean air act and the facility’s air operating permit based on these investigations the federal authorities have issued notices of violation with respect to the facility’s benzene waste operations leak detection and repair program emissions of nitrogen oxides and emissions of particulate matter the company has entered into negotiations with federal authorities to resolve the alleged violations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc “honeywell” for the three years ended december 31 2010 all references to notes related to notes to the financial statements in “item 8financial statements and supplementary data” 

consolidated results of operations 

 the change in net sales compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

 cost of products and services sold increased by 1507 million or 6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs and indirect costs of approximately 1300 million and 300 million respectively driven substantially by an 8 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors discussed above and in the review of business segments section of this mda and an 150 million increase in repositioning and other charges see note 3 of notes to financial statements partially offset by a 300 million decrease in pension expense 

gross margin percentage increased by 12 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower pension expense approximate 1 percentage point impact and higher sales volume driven by our automation and control solutions segment specialty materials segment and transportation systems segment approximate 07 percentage point impact partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges approximate 04 percentage point impact 

cost of products and services sold decreased by 7106 million or 23 percent in the 2009 compared with 2008 the decrease is primarily due to lower pension expense lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the review of business segments section of this mda lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work scheduled reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our business segments and lower repositioning charges 

gross margin percentage increased by 74 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower pension expense increases of 29 and 06 percent respectively in our specialty materials and automation  controls solutions segments as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above and lower repositioning charges partially offset by lower margins in our transportation systems and aerospace solutions segments of 32 and 07 percent respectively due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased as a percentage of sales by 03 percent in 2010 compared to the 2009 driven by the impact of higher sales volume discussed above and lower pension expense partially offset by an estimated 500 million increase in labor costs reflecting the absence of prior period labor cost actions 

sga as a percentage of sales increased by 04 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008 the increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales volumes substantially offset by the positive impact of i lower pension expense ii indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our business segments iii reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and iv lower repositioning charges 

 other income increased by 40 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to i a 62 million pretax gain related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our specialty materials segment in the third quarter of 2010 see note 4 of notes to financial statements for further details ii the absence of an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 62 million in the second quarter of 2009 partially offset by the absence of a 50 million deconsolidation gain related to a subsidiary within our automation and control solutions segment in 2009 and 22 million of acquisition related costs in 2010 

other income decreased by 693 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to i a lower gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets due to the gain on the sale of our consumables solutions business in 2008 partially offset by a gain related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our automation and control solutions segment in 2009 see note 4 to the financial statements and ii lower interest income primarily due to lower interest rates on cash balances 

 interest and other financial charges decreased by 16 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower debt balances and lower borrowing costs 

interest and other financial charges increased by 1 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower debt balances offset by higher borrowing costs on term debt 

 the effective tax rate increased by 57 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower us pension expense the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the medicare part d program the absence of manufacturing incentives a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate the foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii a 05 percentage points impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating loss the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates 

the effective tax rate increased by 604 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower us pension expense and to a lesser extent a decreased impact from the settlement of audits the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates 

in 2011 the effective tax rate could change based upon the company’s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved 

 earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased by 054 per share in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased segment profit in our automation and control solutions specialty materials and transportation systems segments and lower pension expense partially offset by higher tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges 

earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution increased by 097 per share in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to lower pension expense and lower repositioning charges partially offset by a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments decreased other income expense as discussed above and an increase in the number of shares outstanding

  aerospace sales by major customer endmarkets were as follows 

 2010 compared with 2009 

aerospace sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 1 percent reduction of revenue related to amounts recognized for payments to business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers oem payments to partially offset their preproduction costs associated with new aircraft platforms 

details regarding the changes in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

 30 

 aerospace segment profit decreased by 3 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a negative 3 percent impact from the oem payments discussed above operational segment profit was flat in 2010 with the approximate positive 4 percent impact from price and productivity net of inflation including the absence of prior period labor cost actions offset by the benefits from prior repositioning actions offset by an approximate negative 4 percent impact from lower sales volume cost of goods sold totaled 81 billion in 2010 unchanged from 2009 

2009 compared with 2008 

aerospace sales decreased by 15 percent in 2009 details regarding the decrease in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

 aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices

 acs segment profit increased by 11 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit and 2 percent increase from acquisitions the increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 18 percent positive impact from higher sales volume partially offset by an approximate 9 percent negative impact from inflation net of price and productivity including the absence of prior period labor cost actions partially offset by the benefits of prior repositioning cost of goods sold totaled 93 billion in 2010 an increase of approximately 750 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 

2009 compared with 2008 

acs sales decreased by 10 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decreased sales volume reflecting slower global economic growth and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 percent partially offset by a 3 percent growth from acquisitions 

 33 

 acs segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit

 specialty materials segment profit increased by 24 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 25 percent increase in operational segment profit the increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to a 24 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes the positive impact from price and productivity was offset by the negative impact from inflation including the absence of prior period labor cost actions cost of goods sold totaled 36 billion in 2010 an increase of approximately 400 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 

2009 compared with 2008 

specialty materials sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily driven by i a 32 percent decrease in resins and chemicals sales due to substantial price declines arising from pass through of lower raw materials costs partially offset by increased volume most notably in the fourth quarter ii a 19 percent decrease in uop sales due to customer deferrals of projects as a result of reduced demand for additional capacity in the refining and petrochemical industries as well as lower catalyst sales iii a 22 percent decrease in specialty products sales most significantly due to continued demand softness across key customer endmarkets and iv an 11 percent decrease in fluorine products sales due to lower volume sales of refrigerants and insulating materials principally driven by customer inventory reduction initiatives and soft construction and original equipment manufacturing end markets partially offset by price increases 

specialty materials segment profit decreased by 16 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 this decrease is principally due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives and increased prices in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 56 percent increase in segment profit

transportation system 

  2010 compared with 2009 

transportation systems sales increased by 24 percent in 2010 compared with the 2009 primarily due to a 25 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1 percent 

 transportation systems segment profit increased by 317 million in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to the positive impact from increased sales volume cost of goods sold totaled 34 billion in 2010 an increase of approximately 500 million which is also primarily a result of increased sales volume 

2009 compared with 2008 

transportation systems sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009 compared with the 2008 primarily due to lower volumes driven by the ongoing challenging global automotive industry conditions and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the first nine months of 2009 

 transportation systems segment profit decreased by  250 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to lower sales volume as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives in the fourth 

quarter of 2009 these factors and increased turbo technologies volumes resulted in a 66 million increase in transportation systems’ segment profit

 repositioning and other charges 

see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2010 2009 and 2008 our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 200 million in 2011 compared with 2010 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 151 200 and 157 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate a total of 150 million in 2011 and will be funded through operating cash flows 

the following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment 

 liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended 2010 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows 

 2010 compared with 2009 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 257 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to i increased accrued expenses of 690 million due to increased customer advances and incentive compensation accruals ii a 550 million impact from increased deferred taxes excluding the impact of cash taxes iii increased net income of 474 million iv lower cash tax payments of approximately 300 million and v a 219 million decrease in payments for repositioning and other charges partially offset by a i 1059 unfavorable impact from working capital driven by higher receivables and increased purchases of raw materials and component inventory to support higher demand partially offset by a corresponding increase to accounts payable ii increased pension and other postretirement payments of 598 million and iii the absence of 155 million sale of longterm receivables in 2009 

cash used for investing activities increased by 1136 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 835 million most significantly sperian protection discussed below and a net 341 million increase in investments in shortterm marketable securities 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 105 million during 2010 compared to the 2009 primarily due to a decrease in the net repayment of debt including commercial paper of 287 million and an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 158 million partially offset by the repayment of 326 million of debt assumed in the acquisition of sperian protection see below 

2009 compared with 2008 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 155 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to i a favorable impact from working capital of 577 million primarily due to a decrease in inventory of 479 million driven by reduced purchases of raw material and component inventory lower production of finished goods in line with decreased sales volumes and inventory reduction initiatives across each of our segments ii lower cash tax payments of 449 million iii 155 million from the sale of long term receivables iv increased net income of 742 million and v a 718 million impact from increased deferred income taxes excluding the impact of cash tax payments noted above partially offset by i decreased pension expense of 2312 million ii receipts from the sale of insurance receivables of 82 million in 2008 iii a 56 million decreased impact from other current assets most significantly lower receipts from insurance receivables and iv higher repositioning payments of 43 million 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 890 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 1713 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions most significantly the acquisition of norcross and metrolgic in 2008 and a 275 million decrease in expenditures for property plant and equipment partially offset by a 908 million decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses most significantly the divestiture of consumables solutions in 2008 

cash used for financing activities increased by 782 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a net repayment of debt including commercial paper in 2009 of 1272 million compared to net proceeds including commercial paper of 733 million in 2008 partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of 1459 million 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2011 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity 

initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 299 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2010 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2010 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp fitch and moody’s have honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable” to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity we maintain a 28 billion committed bank revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper which expires in midmay 2012 at december 31 2010 there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility the credit facility does not restrict honeywell’s ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants we expect to refinance the credit facility in 2011 

in the first quarter of 2010 the company repaid 1000 million of its 750 notes the repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities 

in october 2010 we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of sperian protection sperian a french company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry the aggregate value net of cash acquired was approximately 1475 million including the assumption of approximately 326 million of outstanding debt 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties as of december 31 2010 and 2009 none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties when we sell receivables they are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion providing us with an additional source of revolving credit as a result program receivables remain on the company’s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either shortterm borrowings or longterm debt 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or suppliers’ ability to obtain financing particularly in our longcycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets customer or supplier bankruptcies delays in their ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations to date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues we continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2011 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2008 we realized 909 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

in january 2011 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its consumer products group business cpg to rank group limited for approximately 950 million the sale which is subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approvals is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011 we currently estimate that the transaction will result in a pretax gain of approximately 350 million approximately 200 million net of tax the sale of cpg within the transportation systems segment is consistent with the company’s strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies 

in july 2008 the company completed the sale of its consumables solutions business to be aerospace “be” for 105 billion consisting of approximately 901 million in cash and six million shares of be common stock as discussed in note 3 to the financial statements this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 623 million 417 million net of tax these proceeds along with our other sources and uses of liquidity as discussed above were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2010 

   43 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2010 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the 

uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 266 318 and 320 million in 2010 2009 and 2008  respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 325 million in 2011 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 225 151 and 466 million in 2010 2009 and 2008  respectively at december 31 2010 and 2009 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 753 and 779 million respectively in addition in 2010 and 2009 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 86 and 73 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso swiss franc czech koruna chinese renminbi indian rupee singapore dollar and swedish krona 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2010 and 2009 

  the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2010 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements 

  contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefit plans intellectual property and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants we also accrued for the probable value of future narco asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the narco trust as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates we also accrued for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system we value bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous five years we will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers at december 31 2010 we have recorded insurance receivables of 718 million that can be specifically allocated to narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of 

probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans — we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees 

in 2010 we elected to change our method of recognizing pension expense previously for our us defined benefit pension plans we used the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor were recognized over a sixyear period under our new accounting method which we adopted in 2010 we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year mtm adjustment this new accounting method results in faster recognition of net actuarial gains and losses than our previous amortization method net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments mtm adjustments were 471 741 and 3290 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets will be recorded on a quarterly basis ongoing pension expense see note 1 to the financial statements for further details of the change and the impact of our retrospective application of the new policy 

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2010 2009 and 2008 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 525 percent discount rate in 2011 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2009 we will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8 percent for 2011 down from 9 percent in 2010 due to lower future expected market returns 

in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future ongoing pension expense the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and ongoing expense to changes in these 

assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment 

 ongoing pension expense for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately 110 million in 2011 a decrease of 79 million from 2010 due primarily to a voluntary contribution of 1 billion in cash to our us pension plans in january 2011 and strong 2010 asset returns also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 in accordance with our new pension accounting method as previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2011 and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 1000 740 and 242 million to our us pension plans in 2010 2009 and 2008  respectively primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets in 2011 we are still not required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements however in january 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of 1 billion to our us plans to improve the funded status of our plans in addition the company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011 the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate we also expect to contribute approximately 55 million to our nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2011 to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2010 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 70 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future 

discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in note 16 to the financial statements we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 30 and 28 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized 

goodwill impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 116 billion as of december 31 2010  is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2010 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date however significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

income taxes — deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2010 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 2015 million less a valuation allowance of 636 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 2015 million consists of 1254 million related to us operations and 761 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1254 million consists of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards federal and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 3 million against such asset related to state net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 761 million consists principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in the united kingdom netherlands luxembourg and germany we maintain a valuation allowance of 634 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance increased by 58 million in 2010 and increased by 133 million and decreased by 45 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon 

examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2010 we recognized approximately 14 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

 5 

 transportation systems 

our transportation systems segment is one of the leading manufacturers of engine boosting systems for passenger cars and commercial vehicles as well as a leading provider of automotive care and braking products 

 aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 35 percent of our total sales in each of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7 9 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 10 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4288 4240 and 4011 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3455 3412 and 3192 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively us defense spending increased in 2009 and is also expected to increase in 2010 we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2010 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 13182 and 12972 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 9339 million of the 2009 backlog will be filled in 2010 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 12 10 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 39 percent of our total sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 

approximately 18 percent of total 2009 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe canada asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2009 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada mexico and asia 

approximately 2 percent of total 2009 sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2009 automation and control solutions sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

approximately 31 percent of total 2009 sales of specialty materials products and services were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 25 percent of total 2009 specialty materials sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2009 sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 68 percent of total 2009 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and latin america 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2009 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier 

the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas benzene the key component in phenol ethylene fluorspar and sulfur in our specialty materials business steel nickel other metals and ethylene glycol in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to remain volatile in addition in 2009 certain large longterm fixed supplier price agreements expired primarily relating to components used by our aerospace business which in the aggregate subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we do not anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2010 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future furthermore the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality andor delivery commitments to us due to bankruptcy natural disasters or any other reason may result in significant costs and delay including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory agencies 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related 

group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell aclar ademco autolite bendix enovate firelite fram garrett hand held holts jurid metrologic mk north notifier novar prestone redex rmg simoniz spectra system sensor and uop 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products the company has research and development activities in the us europe india and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1330 1543 and 1459 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in rd expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales however as a percentage of sales rd increased to 43 percent in 2009 compared to 42 percent in 2008 the increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales product design and development costs in automation and control solutions and specialty materials as well as expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms partially offset by lower rd expense in aerospace primarily due to major program completions the increase in rd expense in 2008 compared to 2007 of 6 percent was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 852 903 and 881 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the company’s business or markets that it serves nor on its results of operations capital expenditures or financial position we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

employees 

we have approximately 122000 employees at december 31 2009 of which approximately 54000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2010 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion inventory levels in distribution channels and global economic growth rates specialty materials’ operating results which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion and commodity demand volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and 

trucks equipped with turbochargers and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products the challenging operating environment faced by global automotive and truck manufacturers is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including access to and terms of government assistance ability to reduce high inventory levels ability to reduce operating costs and the ability of consumers to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and nonmaterial inflation 

raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials benzene the key component in phenol natural gas ethylene fluorspar and sulfur transportation systems nickel steel other metals and ethylene glycol and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis in limited circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes eg product certification or stewardship requirements sourcing restrictions climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards etc our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the 

development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 

we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as mexico china india the middle east and eastern europe in 2009 51 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and in international locations were outside of the us including 28 percent in europe and 11 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes and trade restrictions changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

as we continue to grow our businesses internationally our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the european and asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2009 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 175 billion and 01 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospace’s defense and spacerelated product and services 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 32 and 11 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2009 although us defense spending increased in 2009 and is expected to increase again in 2010 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition and data privacy any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health and safety matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification product liability and environmental remediation may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is 

not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits 

with approximately 122000 employees including approximately 54000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs legislative or regulatory changes and volatility in discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our us pension plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense including discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see “critical accounting policies” included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2009 our tax expense represented 265 percent of our income before 

tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising out of the conduct of our business see a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 

the united states environmental protection agency and the united states department of justice “federal authorities” are investigating whether the storage of certain sludges generated during uranium hexafluoride production at our metropolis illinois facility has been in compliance with the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act the federal authorities have convened a grand jury in this matter this storage issue was previously voluntarily disclosed to the illinois environmental protection agency with whom honeywell has been working to resolve the matter the company has met with the federal authorities and is cooperating fully with the investigation although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

market and dividend information for honeywell’s common stock is included in note 26 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

the number of record holders of our common stock at december 31 2009 was 64617 

honeywell did not purchase any of its common stock par value 1 per share for the year ending december 31 2009 under the company’s previously reported 30 billion share repurchase program 13 billion remained available as of december 31 2009 for additional share repurchases the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the fiveyear cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the standard  poor’s 500 stock index and a composite of standard  poor’s aerospace and defense and industrial conglomerates indices on an equally weighted basis the “composite index” the selection and weighting of the aerospace and defense component of the composite index was deemed appropriate in light of the fact that honeywell’s aerospace segment has accounted for on average approximately 50 of our aggregate segment profit over the past three completed fiscal years the selection and weighting of the industrial conglomerates component of the composite index reflects the diverse and distinct range of nonaerospace businesses conducted by honeywell and their contribution to our overall segment profits the annual changes for the fiveyear period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that 100 had been invested in honeywell stock and each index on december 31 2004 and that all dividends were reinvested

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales in 2009 and 2008 is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

 cost of products and services sold decreased by 4809 million or 17 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 the decrease is primarily due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the review of business segments section of this mda lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work scheduled reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our business segments and lower repositioning charges 

gross margin increased by 16 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increases of 29 and 06 percent respectively in our specialty materials and automation  controls solutions segments as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above and lower repositioning charges partially offset by lower margins in our transportation systems and aerospace solutions segments of 32 and 07 percent respectively due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives 

cost of products and services sold increased by 1694 million or 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 the increase is primarily due to higher sales as a result of the factors discussed within the review of business segments section of this mda acquisitions and higher repositioning charges partially offset by lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense 

gross margin decreased by 06 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to i higher repositioning charges and ii decreases of 22 and 14 percent respectively in our transportation systems and specialty materials segments primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by i lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense ii higher margins in our automation and controls solutions segment of 08 of a percentage point mainly resulting from productivity savings and iii higher margins in our aerospace segment of 02 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth and increased prices 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percentage of sales increased by 02 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008 the increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales volumes substantially offset by i the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our business segments ii reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and iii lower repositioning charges resulting in decreased sga expense of 692 million 

sga as a percentage of sales increased by 06 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher sga in our automation and control solutions segment mainly due to acquisitions partially offset by decreases in sga in our specialty materials and aerospace segments mainly due to cost savings initiatives and the positive impact of prior repositioning actions 

other incomeexpense 

 other income decreased by 693 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to i a lower gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets due to the gain on the sale of our consumables solutions business in 2008 partially offset by a gain related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our automation and control solutions segment in 2009 see note 4 to the financial statements and ii lower interest income primarily due to lower interest rates on cash balances 

other income increased by 679 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a higher gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets representing the sale of our consumables solutions business and higher income from equity method investments mainly in our specialty material segment 

interest and other financial charges 

 interest and other financial charges increased 1 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower debt balances offset by higher borrowing costs on term debt interest and other financial charges were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher debt balances offset by lower borrowing costs 

tax expense 

 the effective tax rate increased by 01 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to a decreased impact from the settlement of audits partially offset by increased benefits from i us manufacturing incentives ii us tax credits and iii employee stock ownership plan dividends the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates 

the effective tax rate increased by 01 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 due principally to a higher overall state effective tax rate and a decreased impact from the settlement of audits partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rate the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign tax rates 

in 2010 the effective tax could change based upon the company’s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved 

net income attributable to honeywell 

 the decrease of 091 in earnings per share of common stock—assuming dilution in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments decreased other income expense as discussed above and an increase in the number of shares outstanding partially offset by lower repositioning charges 

the increase of 060 in earnings per share of common stock—assuming dilution in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily relates to i the gain on sale of the consumables solutions business ii lower pension and other post retirement expense iii an increase in segment profit most significantly in automation and control solutions and aerospace partially offset by a decline in transportation systems segment profit and iv a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to share repurchases partially offset by increased repositioning costs

economic and other factors 

acs’s operating results are principally driven by 

 results of operations 

 2009 compared with 2008 

acs sales decreased by 10 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decreased sales volume reflecting slower global economic growth and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 percent partially offset by a 3 percent growth from acquisitions 

 30 

 acs segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit 

2008 compared with 2007 

acs sales increased by 12 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 including 10 percent net growth from acquisitions and divestitures although foreign exchange had minimal impact on full year sales there was a 9 percent negative impact of foreign exchange on fourth quarter sales 

 acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to increased productivity savings acquisitions and improved pricing partially offset by inflation

economic and other factors 

specialty materials operating results are principally driven by 

 results of operations 

 2009 compared with 2008 

specialty materials sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily driven by i a 32 percent decrease in resins and chemicals sales due to substantial price declines arising from pass through of lower raw materials costs partially offset by increased volume most notably in the fourth quarter ii a 19 percent decrease in uop sales due to customer deferrals of projects as a result of reduced demand for additional capacity in the refining and petrochemical industries as well as lower catalyst sales iii a 22 percent decrease in specialty products sales most significantly due to continued demand softness across key customer endmarkets and iv an 11 percent decrease in fluorine products sales due to lower volume sales of refrigerants and insulating materials principally driven by customer inventory reduction initiatives and soft construction and original equipment manufacturing end markets partially offset by price increases 

specialty materials segment profit decreased by 16 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 this decrease is principally due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives and increased prices in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 56 percent increase in segment profit 

2008 compared with 2007 

specialty materials sales increased by 8 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily driven by i increased pricing reflecting the passthrough of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements most significantly in resins and 

chemicals and fluorine products and ii an 8 percent increase in uop sales as a result of higher volume sales in its products and projects businesses full year 2008 sales growth was partially offset by a 12 percent sales decline in revenue during the fourth quarter primarily in our resins and chemicals business due to sharp declines in global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate 

specialty materials segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 this increase is due principally to increased uop fluorine products and resins and chemicals sales as a result of the factors discussed above and higher income from our joint ventures partially offset by the impacts of hurricanes gustav and ike and the fourth quarter sales decline noted below overall the effects of increased pricing reflecting the passthrough of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements and productivity gains more than offset raw material most significantly sulfur and other inflation

economic and other factors 

transportation systems operating results are principally driven by 

 33 

 results of operations 

 2009 compared with 2008 

transportation systems sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower volumes driven by the ongoing challenging global automotive industry conditions and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the first nine months of 2009 

 transportation systems segment profit decreased by 62 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to lower sales volume as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs reduced labor costs reflecting reduced census work schedule reductions benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors and increased turbo technologies volumes resulted in a 66 million increase in transportation systems’ segment profit we anticipate that new platform launches will translate into increased segment profit in 2010 

2008 compared with 2007 

transportation systems sales decreased by 8 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower volumes most significantly in the second half of 2008 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

 34 

 transportation systems segment profit decreased by 30 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to volume declines as discussed above material and nonmaterial cost inflation and investments in product development to support future turbo platforms these factors were partially offset by increased productivity and the favorable impact of foreign exchange

 repositioning and other charges 

see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2009 2008 and 2007 our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 300 million in 2010 compared with 2009 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 200 157 and 92 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to approximate 225 million in 2010 and will be funded through operating cash flows 

the following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows 

 2009 compared with 2008 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 155 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a favorable impact from working capital of 577 million primarily due to lower inventory lower cash taxes of 449 million and 155 million from the sale of long term receivables partially offset by decreased earnings receipts from the sale of insurance receivables of 82 million in 2008 and higher repositioning payments of 43 million 

cash used for investing activities decreased by 890 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 1713 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions most significantly the acquisition of norcross and metrolgic in 2008 and a 275 million decrease in expenditures for property plant and equipment partially offset by a 908 million decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses most significantly the divestiture of consumables solutions in 2008 

cash used for financing activities increased by 782 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a net repayment of debt including commercial paper in 2009 of 1272 million compared to net proceeds including commercial paper of 733 million in 2008 partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of 1459 million 

2008 compared with 2007 

cash provided by operating activities decreased by 120 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities of 475 million decreased advances from customers and deferred income and higher cash tax payments of 336 million most significantly due to the sale of the consumables solutions business partially offset by increased earnings lower cash payments for asbestos of 121 million and a decrease in working capital lower accounts and other receivable offset by higher accounts payable 

cash used for investing activities increased by 241 million during 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher spending for acquisitions partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of businesses in 2008 cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 2181 million primarily for safety products holding inc norcross and metrologic instruments inc compared to 1150 million in 2007 primarily for our acquisitions of dimensions international enraf holding bv hand held products inc and maxon corporation cash proceeds from divestitures were 909 million in 2008 compared to 51 million in 2007 primarily due to the sale of consumables solutions 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 204 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a 2527 million decrease in repurchases of common stock partially offset by decreases in net proceeds from debt including commercial paper of 1797 million and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 457 million 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2010 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 298 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2009 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2009 standard and poor’s sp fitch and moody’s have ratings on our longterm debt of a and a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively sp and moody’s have maintained honeywell’s ratings outlook as “stable” fitch’s rating outlook is “negative” in 2010 we will support our credit rating through debt repayments to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity we maintain 28 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities in support of our commercial paper program which is secured through midmay 2012 

in may 2007 honeywell entered into a 28 billion amended and restated fiveyear credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed 35 billion this credit facility contains a 700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper at december 31 2009 there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility the credit agreement does not restrict honeywell’s ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants 

in february 2009 the company issued 600 million 3875 senior notes due 2014 and 900 million 500 senior notes due 2019 collectively the “2009 senior notes” the 2009 senior notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 15 billion offset by 12 million in discount and issuance costs proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper 

in august 2009 the company completed the acquisition of the rmg group rmg regel  messtechnik gmbh a natural gas measuring and control products services and integrated solutions company which will be integrated into our automation and control solutions segment the purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately 416 million and was funded using available cash 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties in april 2009 we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion this modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the company balance sheet as a result 500 million of program receivables were reflected as accounts notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as shortterm borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet these shortterm borrowings were repaid as of december 31 2009 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

current global economic conditions or the current tightening of credit could adversely affect our customers’ or suppliers’ ability to obtain financing particularly in our longcycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets customer or supplier bankruptcies delays in their ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations to date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues we continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2010 to be as follows 

 39 

we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2008 we realized 909 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

in july 2008 the company completed the sale of its consumables solutions business to be aerospace “be” for 105 billion consisting of approximately 901 million in cash and six million shares of be common stock as discussed in note 3 to the financial statements this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of 623 million 417 million net of tax these proceeds along with our other sources and uses of liquidity as discussed above were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2009 

 

  

 40 

 the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations during 2010 we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of honeywell common stock to our us plans to improve the funded status of our plans we also expect to make contributions to our nonus plans of approximately 150 million in 2010 beyond 2010 minimum statutory funding requirements for our us pension plans may become significant however the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 200 million in 2010 net of the benefit of approximately 14 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2009 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables —as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2008 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible in april 2009 we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion this modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the company balance sheet as a result 500 million of program receivables were reflected as accounts notes and other receivables with a 

corresponding amount recorded as shortterm borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet these shortterm borrowings were repaid as of december 31 2009 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 318 320 and 267 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 285 million in 2010 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 151 466 and 230 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively at december 31 2009 and 2008 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 779 and 946 million respectively in addition in 2009 and 2008 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 73 and 69 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do 

not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso swiss franc czech koruna chinese renminbi indian rupee and singapore dollar 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 43 

  

 the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2009 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities including asbestos contractual matters and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants we also accrued for the probable value of future narco asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the narco trust as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrue for the estimated value of 

pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates we also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system we value bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous four years we will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers at december 31 2009 we have recorded insurance receivables of 831 million that can be specifically allocated to narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans —we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2009 2008 and 2007 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 575 percent discount rate in 2010 reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2008 we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2010 as this is a longterm rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations the net losses for our pension plans were 76 billion at december 

31 2009 compared with 60 billion at december 31 2008 this increase of 16 billion is due primarily to lower discount rates in our plans partially offset by asset gains due to the performance of the equity markets in 2009 the net losses at december 31 2009 principally result from lower discount rates in 2009 and actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return in 2008 as discussed in detail in note 22 to the financial statements such losses have been recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax in the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor are recognized over a sixyear period 

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

 net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately 820 million in 2010 a 712 million increase from 2009 due principally to an increase in the amortization of net losses in our us plans the increase in the amortization of net losses results principally from asset losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets in 2008 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 740 242 and 42 million to our us pension plans in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets during 2010 we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of honeywell common stock to our us plans to improve the funded status of our plans beyond 2010 minimum statutory funding requirements for our us pension plans may become significant however the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations we also expect to contribute approximately 150 to our nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2010 to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2009 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 66 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 46 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market prices if available level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in note 16 to the financial statements we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 28 and 78 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized 

goodwill impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 105 billion as of december 31 2009 is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions 

we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2009 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date given the significant changes in the business climate and decline in midrange forecasts for certain of our reporting units we retested goodwill for impairment in the second half of 2009 no impairment was indicated by this interim test however significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

income taxes —deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2009 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 3028 million less a valuation allowance of 578 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 3028 million is comprised of 2132 million related to us operations and 896 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 2132 

million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 8 million against such asset related to state net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 896 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in germany luxembourg netherlands and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 570 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance increased by 133 million in 2009 and decreased by 45 million and 26 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2009 we recognized approximately 15 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

 aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 35 percent of our total sales in each of 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 9 10 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 percent of our total sales in each of 2008 2007 and 2006 our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4240 4011 and 3688 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3412 3192 and 3052 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively us defense spending increased in 2008 and is also expected to increase in 2009 we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2009 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 12972 and 12303 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 9480 million of the 2008 backlog will be filled in 2009 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 10 10 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 39 39 and 37 percent of our total sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

approximately 19 percent of total 2008 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe canada asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 14 percent of total 2008 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada and asia 

approximately 2 percent of total 2008 sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2008 automation and control solutions sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

approximately 14 percent of total 2008 sales of specialty materials products and services were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 24 percent of total 2008 specialty materials sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2008 sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 71 percent of total 2008 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and latin america 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2008 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier we have no reason to believe there is any material risk to this supply 

the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas benzene the key component in phenol ethylene fluorspar and sulfur in our specialty materials business steel nickel other metals and ethylene glycol in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business are expected to remain volatile in addition in 2008 certain large longterm fixed supplier price agreements expired primarily relating to components used by our aerospace business which in the aggregate subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm supply agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2009 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are 

generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future furthermore the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality andor delivery commitments to us due to bankruptcy natural disasters or any other reason may result in significant costs and delay including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory agencies 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell aclar ademco autolite bendix enovate firelite fram garrett genetron hand held holts jurid metrologic mk north notifier novar prestone redex simoniz spectra system sensor and uop 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products the company has research and development activities in the us europe india and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1543 1459 and 1411 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in rd expense in 2008 compared to 2007 of 6 percent was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms the increase in rd expense in 2007 compared to 2006 of 3 percent was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 903 881 and 777 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

we have approximately 128000 employees at december 31 2008 of which approximately 58000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2009 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current economic and industry conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms the retirement of older aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts supplier consolidation factory transitions capacity constraints and the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including declining global flying hours aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion and global economic growth rates specialty materials’ operating results which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 are impacted by global economic growth rates capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plants and commodity demand volatility transportation systems’ operating results which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions 

and fuel economy delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products the challenging operating environment faced by global automotive and truck manufacturers is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including access to and terms of government assistance ability to reduce record high inventory levels ability to reduce operating costs and the ability of consumers to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and nonmaterial inflation 

raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials benzene the key component in phenol natural gas ethylene fluorspar and sulfur transportation systems nickel steel other metals and ethylene glycol and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a singlesource basis in limited circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of longlead time products during times of volatile demand our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters extreme weather events pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes or governmental actions our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers andor regulatory agencies in addition because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements which could adversely impact our operating costs profitability and customer and supplier relationships 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop 

or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as mexico china india and the middle east in 2008 49 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and in international locations were outside of the us including 29 percent in europe and 10 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import export and other trade restrictions such as embargoes and trade restrictions changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions and maintaining the safety of our employees the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

as we continue to grow our businesses internationally our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the european and asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets or available for sale investments 

at december 31 2008 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets and available for sale securities totaled approximately 174 billion and 01 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets an other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospace’s defense and spacerelated product and services 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 27 and 9 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2008 although us defense spending increased in 2008 and is expected to increase again in 2009 we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2010 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

we cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company operates including laws governing payments to government officials competition and data privacy any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business results of operations and reputation 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment employee benefit plans tax health and safety matters import export and trade intellectual property product certification product liability and environmental remediation may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe and v the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the 

incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits 

with approximately 128000 employees including approximately 58000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2008 our tax expense represented 265 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing 

the current tightening of credit could also adversely affect our customers’ ability to obtain financing primarily in our long cycle businesses and airline industry operations delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our results of operations the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay as discussed above lastly the disruptions in the us and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business

market and dividend information for honeywell’s common stock is included in note 26 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

the number of record holders of our common stock at december 31 2008 was 66634 

honeywell did not purchase any of its common stock par value 1 per share for the quarter ending december 31 2008 honeywell purchased a total of 27400000 shares of common stock in 2008 under the company’s previously reported 30 billion share repurchase program 13 billion remained available as of december 31 2008 for additional share repurchases the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the fiveyear cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the standard  poor’s 500 stock index and a composite of standard  poor’s aerospace and defense and industrial conglomerates indices on an equally weighted basis the “composite index” the selection and weighting of the aerospace and defense component of the composite index was deemed appropriate in light of the fact that honeywell’s aerospace segment has accounted for on average approximately 50 of our aggregate segment profit over the past three completed fiscal years the selection and weighting of the industrial conglomerates component of the composite index reflects the diverse and distinct range of nonaerospace businesses conducted by honeywell and their contribution to our overall segment profits the annual changes for the fiveyear period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that 100 had been invested in honeywell stock and each index on december 31 2003 and that all dividends were reinvested

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales in 2008 and 2007 is attributable to the following 

 the increase in full year 2008 sales was partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the prior year period a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

 gross margin decreased by 06 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to i higher repositioning charges and ii decreases of 22 and 14 percent respectively in our transportation systems and specialty materials segments primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by i lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense ii higher margins in our automation and controls solutions segment of 08 of a percentage point mainly resulting from productivity savings and iii higher margins in our aerospace segment of 02 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth and increased prices we expect pension and other post retirement expense to increase in 2009 

gross margin increased by 08 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to i higher margins in our specialty materials segment of 10 percentage point mainly due to the continued growth of uop ii higher margins in our aerospace segment of 08 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth increased prices and productivity savings and iii lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense of 03 of a percentage point which were partially offset by lower margins in our transportation systems segment of 10 percentage point primarily attributable to lower consumer products group “cpg” sales volume and operational planning and production issues 

for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percentage of sales increased by 06 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher sga in our automation and control solutions segment mainly due to acquisitions partially offset by decreases in sga in our specialty materials and aerospace segments mainly due to cost savings initiatives and the positive impact of prior repositioning actions 

sga as a percentage of sales decreased by 02 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 sga as a percentage of sales decreased in all of our segments primarily due to the benefits from cost savings initiatives and the positive impact of prior repositioning actions a reduction of 01 of a percentage point from lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense was offset by higher repositioning costs 

other incomeexpense 

 other income increased by 675 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a higher gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses and assets representing the sale of our consumables solutions 

business and higher income from equity method investments mainly in our specialty material segment 

other income decreased by 58 million or 52 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of lower interest income due to interest received on a favorable tax settlement in 2006 and higher foreign exchange losses due to changes in exchange rates 

interest and other financial charges 

 interest and other financial charges were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher debt balances offset by lower borrowing costs interest and other financial charges increased by 22 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 due to higher debt balances and higher borrowing costs 

tax expense 

 the effective tax rate increased by 01 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 due principally to a higher overall state effective tax rate and a decreased impact from the settlement of audits partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rate the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign tax rates 

the effective tax rate increased by 07 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 due principally to the expiration of the tax benefit on export sales partially offset by a decrease in the overall state and foreign effective tax rate an increase in the tax benefit for the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of certain tax audits the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits derived from lower foreign taxes and benefits from tax planning strategies 

in 2009 the effective tax could change based upon the company’s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be utilized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved 

income from continuing operations 

 the increase of 060 in earnings diluted per share from continuing operations in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily relates to i the gain on sale of the consumables solutions business ii lower pension and other post retirement expense iii an increase in segment profit most significantly in automation and control solutions and aerospace partially offset by a decline in transportation systems segment profit and iv a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to share repurchases partially offset by increased repositioning costs 

the increase of 065 in earnings diluted per share from continuing operations in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily relates to an increase in segment profit most significantly in aerospace and automation and control solutions a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to share 

repurchases and lower pension and other post retirement expense partially offset by increased repositioning costs 

for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations of 5 million or 001 earnings per share diluted in 2006 relates to the operating results of the indalex business which was sold in february 2006 to sun capital partners inc

2008 compared with 2007 

aerospace sales increased by 3 percent in 2008 details regarding the net increase in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

 aerospace segment profit increased by 5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to increased prices productivity and sales volume growth these increases are partially offset by inflation the consumable solutions divestiture and higher spending to support new platform growth we expect segment profit to decline in the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to the expected adverse sales impacts noted above 

2007 compared with 2006 

aerospace sales increased by 10 percent in 2007 details regarding the net increase in sales by customer endmarkets are as follows 

 28 

 aerospace segment profit increased by 16 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to sales volume growth increased prices and productivity partially offset by inflation

 29 

 results of operations 

 2008 compared with 2007 

acs sales increased by 12 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 including 10 percent net growth from acquisitions and divestitures although foreign exchange had minimal impact on full year sales there was a 9 percent negative impact of foreign exchange on fourth quarter sales 

 acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to increased productivity savings acquisitions and improved pricing partially offset by inflation 

2007 compared with 2006 

acs sales increased by 13 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 including 4 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange and net growth from acquisitions and divestitures of 2 percent 

 acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to increased products and solutions sales volume and productivity savings partially offset by inflation we continue to experience a change in mix resulting from stronger sales growth in our solutions businesses that historically have lower margins than our products businesses 

2009 areas of focus 

acs’s primary areas of focus for 2009 include 

 30 

 specialty materials 

overview 

specialty materials develops and manufactures highpurity highquality and highperformance chemicals and materials for applications in the refining petrochemical automotive healthcare agricultural packaging refrigeration appliance housing semiconductor wax and adhesives segments specialty materials also provides process technology products and services for the petroleum refining petrochemical and other industries specialty materials’ product portfolio includes fluorocarbons caprolactam ammonium sulfate for fertilizer specialty films advanced fibers customized research chemicals and intermediates electronic materials and chemicals catalysts and adsorbents 

economic and other factors 

specialty materials operating results are principally driven by 

 results of operations 

 2008 compared with 2007 

specialty materials sales increased by 8 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily driven by i increased pricing reflecting the passthrough of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements most significantly in resins and chemicals and fluorine products and ii an 8 percent increase in uop sales as a result of higher volume sales in its products and projects businesses full year 2008 sales growth was partially offset by a 12 percent sales decline in revenue during the fourth quarter primarily in our resins and chemicals business due to sharp declines in global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate 

specialty materials segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 this increase is due principally to increased uop fluorine products and resins and chemicals sales as a result of the factors discussed above and higher income from our joint ventures partially offset by the impacts of hurricanes gustav and ike and the fourth quarter sales decline noted below overall the effects of increased pricing reflecting the passthrough of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements and productivity gains more than offset raw material most significantly sulfur and other inflation 

in 2009 we expect continued declines in global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate as well as demand from semiconductor customers and delays in the timing of new unit deliveries of uop products and catalyst reloads 

2007 compared with 2006 

specialty materials sales increased by 5 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 driven by i a 16 percent increase in uop sales primarily as a result of higher volume in its projects business principally due to capacity expansion in the refining and petrochemical industries and ii a 4 percent increase in specialty products sales due in large part to increased sales of electronic chemicals and specialty additives and higher sales to customers in the health care industry partially offsetting these increases was a 6 percent decrease in fluorine products sales primarily due to lower refrigerant pricing and lower sales volume of foam blowing agents used in insulating material as a result of continued weakness in the us housing market 

specialty materials segment profit increased by 16 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to increased uop and specialty products sales partially offset by the decline in fluorine products sales as a result of the factors discussed above additionally the effects of increased pricing and productivity more than offset raw material and other cost inflation 

2009 areas of focus 

specialty materials primary areas of focus for 2009 include 

 transportation systems 

overview 

transportation systems provides automotive products that improve the performance efficiency and appearance of cars trucks and other vehicles through stateoftheart technologies world class brands and global solutions to customers’ needs transportation systems’ products include turbochargers and chargeair and thermal systems car care products including antifreeze prestoner filters framr spark plugs autoliter and cleaners waxes and additives holtsr and brake hard parts and other friction materials bendixr and juridr transportation 

systems sells its products to original equipment “oe” automotive and truck manufacturers eg bmw caterpillar daimler renault ford and volkswagen wholesalers and distributors and through the retail aftermarket 

economic and other factors 

transportation systems operating results are principally driven by 

 results of operations 

 2008 compared with 2007 

transportation systems sales decreased by 8 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower volumes most significantly in the second half of 2008 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

 transportation systems segment profit decreased by 30 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to volume declines as discussed above material and nonmaterial cost inflation and investments in product development to support future turbo platforms these factors were partially offset by increased productivity and the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

2007 compared with 2006 

transportation systems sales increased 9 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the 5 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange and increased turbo technologies sales volume 

 transportation system segment profit increased by 2 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to increased productivity increased prices and lower warranty expense partially offset by the impact of inflation primarily relating to nickel components investment in product development to support future turbo platforms costs associated with cpg product introductions and cpg operational planning and production issues 

2009 areas of focus 

transportation systems primary areas of focus in 2009 include 

 repositioning and other charges 

see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2008 2007 and 2006 the 2008 and 2007 repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 180 million in 2009 compared with 2008 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 157 92 and 142 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to approximate 250 million in 2009 and will be funded through operating cash flows

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows 

 2008 compared with 2007 

cash provided by operating activities decreased by 120 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities of 475 million decreased advances from customers and deferred income and higher cash tax payments of 336 million most significantly due to the sale of the consumables solutions business partially offset by increased earnings lower cash payments for asbestos of 121 million and a decrease in working capital lower accounts and other receivable offset by higher accounts payable 

cash used for investing activities increased by 241 million during 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher spending for acquisitions partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of businesses in 2008 cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 2181 million primarily for safety products holding inc norcross and metrologic instruments inc compared to 1150 million in 2007 primarily for our acquisitions of dimensions international enraf holding bv hand held products inc and maxon corporation cash proceeds from divestitures were 909 million in 2008 compared to 51 million in 2007 primarily due to the sale of consumables solutions 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 204 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a 2527 million decrease in repurchases of common stock partially offset by decreases in net proceeds from debt including commercial paper of 1797 million and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 457 million 

2007 compared with 2006

cash used for investing activities increased by 1168 million during 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to higher spending for acquisitions and lower proceeds from sales of businesses in 2007 cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 1150 million primarily for dimensions international enraf holding bv hand held products inc and maxon corporation compared to 633 

million in 2006 primarily for our acquisitions of first technologies and gardiner groupe sale proceeds from divestitures was 51 million in the 2007 compared to 665 million in 2006 primarily due to the sale of indalex in february 2006 for 425 million first technology safety  analysis business ftsa for 93 million in may 2006 and the sale of first technology automotive business in december 2006 for 90 million 

cash used for financing activities decreased by 1075 million during 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to a 2620 million increase in net proceeds from debt including commercial paper and short term borrowings a 306 million reduction in cash used for payment of debt assumed with acquisitions and an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 207 million partially offset by increases in repurchases of common stock of 2090 million 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2009 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 270 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 1431 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies as of december 31 2008 standard and poor’s fitch’s and moody’s rating services have ratings on our longterm debt of a and a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively and maintained honeywell’s ratings outlook as “stable” in 2009 we will support our credit rating through debt repayments to date the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity we maintain 38 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities in support of our commercial paper program 28 billion of which is secured through midmay 2012 

in may 2007 honeywell entered into a 28 billion amended and restated fiveyear credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed 35 billion this credit facility contains a 700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper and replaces the previous 23 billion five year credit agreement dated april 27 2006 “prior agreement” at december 31 2008 there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility the credit agreement does not restrict honeywell’s ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants 

in february 2008 the company issued 600 million 425 senior notes due 2013 and 900 million 530 senior notes due 2018 collectively the “senior notes” the senior notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 15 billion offset by 13 million in discount and issuance costs proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net 

proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

we also sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables were overcollateralized by 93 million at december 31 2008 and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools new receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are collected the retained interests in the receivables are reflected at the amounts expected to be collected by us and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests the sold receivables were 500 million at both december 31 2008 and 2007 

we monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we are also monitoring the ability of our customers to obtain financing in order to mitigate any adverse impact on our revenues primarily in our long cycle businesses 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2009 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition 

candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2008 and 2007 we realized 909 million and 51 million respectively in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

in july 2008 the company completed the sale of its consumables solutions business to be aerospace “be” for 105 billion consisting of approximately 901 million in cash and six million shares of be common stock as discussed in note 3 to the financial statements this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of 623 million 417 million net of tax these proceeds along with our other sources and uses of liquidity as discussed above were utilized to investment in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2008 

 

  

 39 

 the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations we made voluntary cash contributions of 42 42 and 68 million to our us pension plans in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in december 2008 we also made a voluntary contribution of 200 million of honeywell common stock to our us plans to improve the funded status of our plans which deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets during 2009 we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of honeywell common stock to our us plans totaling approximately 800 million to improve the funded status of our plans any additional future plan contributions necessary to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2009 interest rates remain constant and there are no additional changes to us pension funding legislation we expect that we would be required to make contributions to our us pension plans of approximately 360 700 1000 and 800 million in 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements we may also make voluntary contributions to our us pension plans from time to time we also expect to make cash contributions to our nonus plans of approximately 140 million in 2009 payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 204 million in 2009 net of the benefit of approximately 15 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2008 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables —as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2008 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the 

purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible at december 31 2008 our retained subordinated and undivided interests at risk were 93 and 480 million respectively based on the underlying credit quality of the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold we do not expect that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing hazardous substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 320 267 and 264 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 330 million in 2009 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 466 230 and 218 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively at december 31 2008 and 2007 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 946 and 799 million respectively in addition in 2008 and 2007 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 69 and 81 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely 

affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements we also hold investments in marketable equity securities which exposes us to market volatility as discussed in note 16 to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso swiss franc czech koruna chinese renminbi indian rupee and japanese yen 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

  

 the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2008 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities including asbestos contractual matters and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as 

the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of fact changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants we also accrued for the probable value of future narco asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the narco trust as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 5 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates we also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system we value bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous three years we will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers at december 31 2008 we have recorded insurance receivables of 877 million that can be specifically allocated to narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans —we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying longterm periods 

combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for actual and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2008 2007 and 2006 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date we will use a 695 percent discount rate in 2009 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since december 31 2007 we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2009 based principally on our historical experience of actual plan returns the net losses for our pension plans were 60 billion at december 31 2008 compared with 17 billion at december 31 2007 this increase of 43 billion is due primarily to asset losses in our us plans in 2008 due to the poor performance of the equity markets throughout 2008 the net losses at december 31 2008 principally result from actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return in 2008 and from the decline each year in the discount rate for the period 2002 through 2006 since our adoption of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 158 as of december 31 2006 which is discussed in detail in notes 1 and 22 to the financial statements such losses have been recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax in the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor are recognized over a sixyear period 

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

 net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately 170 million in 2009 a 193 million increase from 2008 due principally to an increase in the amortization of net losses in our us plans the increase in the amortization of net losses results principally from asset losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets throughout 2008 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary cash contributions of 42 42 and 68 million to our us pension plans in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively for government contracting purposes in december 2008 we also made a voluntary contribution of 200 

million of honeywell common stock to our us plans to improve the funded status of our plans which deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets during 2009 we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of honeywell common stock to our us plans totaling approximately 800 million to improve the funded status of our plans any additional future plan contributions necessary to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2009 interest rates remain constant and there are no additional changes to us pension funding legislation we expect that we would be required to make contributions to our us pension plans of approximately 360 700 1000 and 800 million in 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements we also expect to contribute approximately 140 million in cash in 2009 to our nonus defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2008 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 68 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we use the best information available to determine fair value which are usually either market prices if available or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in the repositioning and other charges section of our mda we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 78 and 23 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized and certain administrative facilities and information technology equipment in our corporate segment 

goodwill impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 102 billion as of december 31 2008 is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in statement of financial accounting standards no 142 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach incorporating historic and projected future operating performance this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating 

performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2008 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 

income taxes —deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2008 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 2762 million less a valuation allowance of 445 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 2762 million is comprised of 2267 million related to us operations and 495 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 2267 million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 6 million against such asset related to state net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 495 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in germany france and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 439 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance decreased by 45 million and 26 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively and increased by 39 in 2006 in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin 48” which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2008 we recognized approximately 13 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our 

automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

aerospace sales 

our sales to aerospace customers were 35 percent of our total sales in each of 2007 and 2006 and 38 percent of our total sales in 2005 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 10 10 and 9 percent of our total sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 11 and 15 percent of our total sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 4011 3688 and 3719 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3192 3052 and 2939 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively us defense spending increased in 2007 and is also expected to increase in 2008 we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2008 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

our total backlog at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 12303 and 10674 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 9155 million of the 2007 backlog will be filled in 2008 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option 

competition 

we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers 

international operations 

we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 10 11 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 39 37 and 35 percent of our total sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

approximately 18 percent of total 2007 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe canada asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 14 

percent of total 2007 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada and asia 

approximately 2 percent of total 2007 sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2007 automation and control solutions sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia canada and latin america 

approximately 18 percent of total 2007 sales of specialty materials products and services were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 23 percent of total 2007 specialty materials sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2007 sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 70 percent of total 2007 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia latin america and canada 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2007 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier we have no reason to believe there is any material risk to this supply 

we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future 

the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas benzene the key component in phenol ethylene and sulfur in our specialty materials’ business steel nickel other metals and ethylene glycol in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business have been and are expected to remain at high price levels in addition in 2007 certain large longterm fixed supplier price agreements expired primarily relating to components used by our aerospace business which in the aggregate subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or longterm price agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2008 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses 

are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell uop prestone fram autolite bendix jurid holts garrett ademco firelite notifier system sensor mk novar genetron enovate spectra aclar simoniz and redex 

research and development 

our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products the company has research and development activities in the us europe india and china 

research and development rd expense totaled 1459 1411 and 1072 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in rd expense in 2007 compared to 2006 of 3 percent was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in automation and control solutions and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms the increase in rd expense in 2006 compared to 2005 of 32 percent was primarily due to the impact of additional rd expense for uop in specialty materials as well as product design and development costs in aerospace and automation and control solutions customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 881 777 and 694 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

environment 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

we have approximately 122000 employees at december 31 2007 of which approximately 57000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the overview of the company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2008 these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

the operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production andor the retirement of older aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as supplier consolidation factory transitions and capacity constraints and the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 36 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion and global economic growth rates specialty materials’ operating results which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 are impacted by global economic growth rates and capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining and petrochemical plants transportation systems’ operating results which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy and consumer spending levels and patterns for automotive aftermarket and car care products each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices as further described below and nonmaterial inflation 

raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials benzene the key component in phenol natural gas ethylene and sulfur transportation systems nickel steel other metals and ethylene glycol and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers formula or longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials including raw materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations we also depend in limited instances on sole source suppliers our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes or governmental actions our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively and v develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise 

our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own or are licensed under a large number of us and nonus patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india and the middle east in 2007 49 percent of our total sales including products manufactured in the us and in international locations were outside of the us including 29 percent in europe and 11 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions including embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

as we continue to grow our businesses internationally our operating results could be increasingly effected by the relative strength of the european and asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets 

at december 31 2007 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 157 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess our longlived assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners’ equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospace’s defense and spacerelated product and services 

sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the us department of defense comprised approximately 26 and 9 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 although us defense spending increased in 2007 and is expected to increase again in 2008 we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2009 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the us government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on 

congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings andor have its export privileges suspended the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care enviornmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials’ results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe andor iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans intellectual property import and export matters and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and income benefits 

with approximately 122000 employees including 57000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and income benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs and changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and income benefit expenses may affect our future profitability 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2007 our tax expense represented 264 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that 

could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures 

volatility of credit markets or macroeconomic factors may increase our cost of financing 

changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising out of the conduct of our business see a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 

although we cannot predict the outcome of the matters described below we believe that sufficient provisions have been made in our financial statements for these matters we do not believe that the matters described below will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

we have been engaged in discussions with the louisiana department of environmental quality ladeq to resolve alleged civil environmental violations at our baton rouge and geismar louisiana facilities that relate in part to a release of chlorine a release of antimony pentachloride which resulted in an employee fatality and an employee exposure to hydrofluoric acid at the baton rouge facility that were the subject of a previously reported matter a settlement has been reached with ladeq under which honeywell will pay a fine of 250000 and perform certain additional supplemental environmental projects for a total cost of approximately of 630000 in december 2007 the united states epa referred additional civil claims related to these incidents to the department of justice at the department of justice’s request honeywell has signed a tolling agreement while the parties discuss resolving these claims 

honeywell is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the arizona attorney general’s office on behalf of the arizona department of environmental quality adeq the complaint alleges failure to make required disclosures as well as unrelated environmental violations adeq’s most significant allegations have been dismissed with prejudice over the course of the proceedings the state has voluntarily dismissed its remaining claims without prejudice pending consideration of an appeal of its previously dismissed claims 

in february 2007 adeq demanded penalties for alleged violations by honeywell of the state’s underground storage tank regulations at the aircraft engines plant in phoenix arizona adeq subsequently added claims relating to other alleged environmental violations at the aircraft engines plant and has made a demand to resolve all alleged violations which we are evaluating negotiations regarding the penalty are ongoing 

honeywell received notices of violation from the maricopa county air quality department in july 2006 with respect to various air permitting compliance matters at one of its facilities located in phoenix arizona honeywell believes it has taken appropriate corrective and preventive actions to address the concerns raised by the county

market and dividend information for honeywell’s common stock is included in note 26 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

the number of record holders of our common stock at december 31 2007 was 69767 

the following table summarizes honeywell’s purchases of its common stock par value 1 per share for the quarter ending december 31 2007 under its previously reported 3 billion authorized share repurchase program honeywell purchased a total of 74235000 shares of common stock in 2007 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

 

  

 honeywell intends to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time in the open market using cash flow generated by operations the amount and timing of repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of other investing activities 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the fiveyear cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the standard  poor’s 500 stock index and a composite of standard  poor’s aerospace and defense and industrial conglomerates indices on an equally weighted basis the “composite index” the selection and weighting of the aerospace and defense component of the composite index was deemed appropriate in light of the fact that honeywell’s aerospace segment has accounted for on average approximately 50 of our aggregate segment profit over the past three completed fiscal years the selection and weighting of the industrial conglomerates component of the composite index reflects the diverse and distinct range of nonaerospace businesses conducted by honeywell and their contribution to our overall segment profits the annual changes for the fiveyear period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that 100 had been invested in honeywell stock and each index on december 31 2002 and that all dividends were reinvested

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

 the change in net sales in 2007 and 2006 is attributable to the following 

 a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

 gross margin increased by 08 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to i higher margins in our specialty materials segment of 10 percentage point mainly due to the continued growth of uop ii higher margins in our aerospace segment of 08 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth increased prices and productivity savings and iii lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense of 03 of a percentage point which were partially offset by lower margins in our transportation systems segment of 10 percentage point primarily attributable to lower consumer products group “cpg” sales volume and operational planning and production issues 

gross margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher margins in our specialty materials segment following our acquisition of full ownership of uop 13 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 05 of a percentage point partially offset by higher repositioning costs of 02 of a percentage point 

for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percentage of sales decreased by 02 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 sga as a percentage of sales decreased in all of our segments primarily due to the benefits from cost savings initiatives and the positive impact of prior repositioning actions a reduction of 01 of a percentage point from lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense was offset by higher repositioning costs 

sga as a percentage of sales was flat in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to a reduction in expenses in our aerospace segment which reflects the benefit of prior restructuring actions offsetting higher expenses in automation and control solutions acs and specialty materials as a result of acquisitions a reduction of repositioning and pension costs of 02 of a percentage point offset the 02 of a percentage point increase for expenses of 77 million relating to stockbased compensation expense following the adoption of fas no 123r see note 20 to the financial statements 

other incomeexpense 

 other income decreased by 58 million or 52 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of lower interest income due to interest received on a favorable tax settlement in 2006 and higher foreign exchange losses due to changes in exchange rates 

other income decreased by 120 million or 52 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 121 million reduction in equity income of affiliated companies primarily related to uop following our acquisition of full ownership of uop in november 2005 

interest and other financial charges 

 interest and other financial charges increased by 22 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and 5 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to higher debt balances and higher borrowing costs 

tax expense 

 the effective tax rate increased by 07 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 due principally to the expiration of the tax benefit on export sales partially offset by a decrease in the overall state and foreign effective tax rate an increase in the tax benefit for the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of certain tax audits the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits derived from lower foreign taxes and benefits from tax planning strategies 

the effective tax rate decreased by 62 percentage points in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to the absence of the 2005 onetime tax charge of 155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 offset in part by 64 million of tax benefits associated with the 2005 sale of our industrial wax business which had a higher tax basis than book basis in addition in 2006 there were benefits recognized from the favorable resolution of certain tax audits offset by a tax charge for an upfront licensing of certain inprocess research and development the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits derived from export sales lower foreign taxes and benefits from tax planning strategies see note 6 to the financial statements for further information on taxes including a detailed effective tax rate reconciliation 

in 2008 the effective tax rate could change based upon the company’s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period that they are resolved 

income from continuing operations 

 the increase of 065 in earnings diluted per share from continuing operations in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily relates to an increase in segment profit most significantly in aerospace and automation and control solutions a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to the previously announced stock repurchase program and lower pension and other post retirement expense partially offset by increased repositioning costs 

the increase of 067 in earnings diluted per share for continuing operations in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily relates to an increase in segment profit in aerospace and automation and control solutions and income generated from our acquisition of full ownership of uop in specialty materials reduced repositioning and pension costs and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to the previously announced stock repurchase program offset by the impact of adopting fas no 123r “sharebased payment” for stockbased compensation expense of 77 million in 2006 in addition in 2005 there was a onetime tax charge of 155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which decreased earnings and earnings per share in 2005 

for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations of 5 million or 001 earnings per share diluted in 2006 relates to the operating results of the indalex business which was sold in february 2006 to sun capital partners inc

 acs sales increased by 13 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 including 4 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange and net growth from acquisitions and divestitures of 2 percent 

 acs sales increased by 17 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 including 7 percent net impact from acquisitions and divestitures 

 acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to increased products and solutions sales volume and productivity savings partially offset by inflation we continue to experience a change in mix resulting from stronger sales growth in our solutions businesses that historically have lower margins than our products businesses 

acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to increased sales volume and productivity savings including net integration savings from our acquisitions that more than offset continued inflation segment profit was also negatively impacted in 2006 by a contract loss experienced on a building solutions project and by erp implementation costs 

2008 areas of focus 

acs’s primary areas of focus for 2008 include 

 specialty materials 

overview 

specialty materials develops and manufactures highpurity highquality and highperformance chemicals and materials for applications in the automotive healthcare agricultural packaging carpet fibers refrigeration appliance housing semiconductor wax and adhesives segments specialty materials also provides process technology products and services for the petroleum refining petrochemical and other industries specialty materials’ product portfolio includes fluorocarbons caprolactam ammonium sulfate for fertilizer specialty films advanced fibers customized research chemicals and intermediates electronic materials and chemicals catalysts and adsorbents 

economic and other factors 

specialty materials operating results are principally driven by 

 results of operations 

 specialty materials sales increased by 5 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 driven by i a 16 percent increase in uop sales primarily as a result of higher volume in its projects business principally due to capacity expansion in the refining and petrochemical industries and ii a 4 percent increase in specialty products sales due in large part to increased sales of electronic chemicals and specialty additives and higher sales to customers in the health care industry partially offsetting these increases was a 6 percent decrease in fluorine products sales primarily due to lower refrigerant pricing and lower sales volume of foam blowing agents used in insulating material as a result of continued weakness in the us housing market 

specialty materials sales increased by 43 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to organic sales growth of 7 percent and 36 percent growth due to our uop acquisition net of divestitures 

organic growth was 7 percent in 2006 primarily due to higher volume and prices organic sales in our fluorine products business increased by 9 percent due to continued strong demand for non ozone depleting hfc products and organic growth in our resins and chemicals business was 4 percent primarily due to price increases to recover increased raw material costs both of these businesses experienced lower sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to the slowdown in the us residential housing industry our resins and chemicals business was also negatively impacted by a partial facility outage in the second half of 2006 specialty products organic sales increased by 10 percent due to higher sales to our customers in the semiconductor industry and increased sales of our specialty additives and our advanced fiber body armor in 2005 organic sales increased by 4 percent largely as a result of higher prices of 7 percent primarily in our resins and chemicals and fluorine businesses offsetting lower volumes in specialty products businesses 

sales from acquisitions net of divestitures grew by 36 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 this was due to a 44 percent growth in sales from uop which was consolidated into the specialty materials segment following our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in uop in november 2005 prior to that date uop results were included in other income uop sales have grown due to continued strength in the petrochemical and refining industries this growth was offset by the loss of sales of 8 percent principally from the divestiture of our industrial wax and north american nylon fiber businesses 

specialty materials segment profit increased by 16 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to increased uop and specialty products sales partially offset by the decline in fluorine products sales as a result of the factors discussed above additionally the effects of increased pricing and productivity more than offset raw material and other cost inflation 

specialty materials segment profit increased by 121 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to the impact of the uop acquisition net of divestitures and increased organic growth and productivity savings net of the lost margin from the partial facility outage price increases including benefits from formula based pricing contracts offset the impact of continued inflation in raw material costs 

2008 areas of focus 

specialty materials primary areas of focus for 2008 include

 results of operations 

 transportation systems sales increased 9 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the 5 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange and increased turbo technologies sales volume 

 transportation systems sales increased 2 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to increased turbo technologies sales offset by lower cpg sales 

 transportation system segment profit increased by 2 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to increased productivity increased prices and lower warranty expense partially offset by the impact of inflation primarily relating to nickel components investment in product development to support future turbo platforms costs associated with cpg product introductions and cpg operational planning and production issues 

transportation systems segment profit increased by 3 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to increased turbo technologies volume and productivity savings including the benefits of prior year restructuring actions which offset higher material and labor inflation and increased warranty expense

 repositioning and other charges 

a summary of repositioning and other charges follows 

 the following table summarizes the pretax distribution of total net repositioning and other charges by income statement classification 

 the following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment 

  31 

   in 2007 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 209 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 3408 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our automation and control solutions and aerospace segments also 18 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance at our transportation systems and aerospace segments were returned to income in 2007 due mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs 

in 2006 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 124 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 2253 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments also 22 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance at our aerospace transportation systems and specialty materials segments were returned to income in 2006 due mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior aerospace severance actions 

in 2005 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 267 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 5269 maufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments including the implementation of a new organizational structure in our aerospace segment substantially implemented in the third quarter of 2005 which reorganized our aerospace businesses to better align with customer segments also 25 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance at our corporate specialty materials and automation and control solutions segments were returned to income in 2005 the reversal of severance liabilities related to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs excise taxes related to an executive severance amount previously paid which were determined to no longer be payable and severance amounts previously 

paid to an outside service provider as part of an outsourcing arrangement which were refunded to honeywell 

these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 100 million in 2008 compared with 2007 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 92 142 and 171 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate 150 million in 2008 and will be funded through operating cash flows 

in 2007 we recognized a charge of 225 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year we recognized asbestos related litigation charges net of insurance of 100 million which are discussed in note 21 to the financial statements we recognized other charges of 18 million for a business sales tax related to a prior divestiture 8 million and for contemplated settlements of certain legal matters 10 million we also recognized impairment charges of 9 million related to the writedown of property plant and equipment held for sale in our specialty materials segment

in 2005 we recognized a charge of 186 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year we recognized asbestos related litigation charges net of insurance of 10 million which are discussed in note 21 to the financial statements we recognized a credit of 67 million in connection with an arbitration award for overcharges by a supplier of phenol to our specialty materials business from june 2003 through the end of 2004 we recognized impairment charges of 23 million related to the writedown of property plant and equipment held and used in our specialty materials segment we also recognized other charges of 18 million principally related to the modification of a lease agreement for the corporate headquarters facility 10 million and for various legal settlements 7 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines shortterm debt from the commercial paper market longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows 

 cash provided by operating activities increased by 700 million during 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to increased earnings an increase in accrued liabilities of 349 million primarily compensation benefits and other employee related accruals as well as customer advances and deferred income a 55 million decrease in repositioning payments partially offset by decreased deferred income tax expense of 118 million and increased working capital usage of 68 million accounts and other receivables inventory and accounts payable cash provided by operating activities increased by 769 million during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to increased earnings lower cash payments for asbestos of 331 million receipt of 100 million from the sale of an insurance receivable an increase in customer advances and deferred income net of acquisitions of 115 million and 93 million receipt of an arbitration award relating to specialty materials partially offset by increased working capital usage accounts and other receivables net of tax receivables inventory and accounts payable of 263 million including proceeds of 58 million from the sale of a longterm receivable higher cash tax payments net of tax receipts of 236 million and higher pension and postretirement payments of 154 million

increased net proceeds from debt of 258 million and increased proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of 229 million offset by increase in repurchases of common stock of 763 million and increased dividend payments 

liquidity 

each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2008 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines short term debt from the commercial paper markets longterm borrowings and access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 270 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 1756 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2007 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and our 30 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities revolving credit facilities our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies in 2007 standard and poor’s fitch’s and moody’s rating services affirmed their corporate ratings on our longterm debt of a and a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively and maintained honeywell’s ratings outlook as “stable” 

in march 2007 the company issued 400 million of 530 senior notes due 2017 and 600 million 570 senior notes due 2037 collectively the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 1 billion offset by 12 million in discount and issuance costs proceeds from the notes were used to repay commercial paper and debt 

in may 2007 honeywell entered into a 28 billion amended and restated fiveyear credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed 35 billion this credit facility contains a 700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper and replaces the previous 23 billion five year credit agreement dated april 27 2006 “prior agreement” at december 31 2007 there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility the credit agreement does not restrict honeywell’s ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants 

in july 2007 the company issued 500 million floating rate senior notes due 2009 and 400 million 5625 senior notes due 2012 collectively the “senior notes” the senior notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all honeywell’s subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 900 million offset by 3 million in discount and issuance costs proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay commercial paper 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

we also sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables were overcollateralized by 101 million at december 31 2007 and we retain a 

subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools new receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are collected the retained interests in the receivables are reflected at the amounts expected to be collected by us and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests the sold receivables were 500 million at both december 31 2007 and 2006 

in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2008 to be as follows 

 we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2007 we realized 51 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide 

additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2007 

 

  

 the table excludes 666 million of uncertain tax positions see note 6 to the financial statements 

the table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations we made voluntary contributions of 42 and 68 million to our us pension plans in 2007 and 2006 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2008 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 40 million to our us plans in 2008 for government contracting purposes we expect to make contributions to our nonus plans of approximately 125 million in 2008 payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 206 million in 2008 net of the benefit of approximately 15 million 

from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2007 

 we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables —as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2007 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible at december 31 2007 our retained subordinated and undivided interests at risk were 101 and 721 million respectively based on the underlying credit quality of the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold we do not expect that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 to the financial statements to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional 

technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 267 264 and 247 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 300 million in 2008 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 230 210 and 186 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 799 and 831 million respectively in addition in 2007 and 2006 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 81 and 101 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements 

we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso swiss franc czech koruna chinese renminbi and japanese yen 

our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of 

our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

  

 the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants new accounting standards effective in 2007 which had a material impact on our 

consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements 

contingent liabilities —we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities including asbestos contractual matters and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of fact changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries —we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos refractory and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants we also accrued for the probable value of future narco asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the narco trust as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 5 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates since the fourth quarter of 2006 we also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system in december 2006 we also changed our methodology for valuing bendix pending and future claims from using average resolution values for the previous five years to using average resolution values for the previous two years the claims filing experience and resolution data for bendix related claims has become more reliable over the past several years accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2007 we updated our methodology for valuing bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the past three years we will continue to updated the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year for additional information see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers at december 31 2007 we have recorded insurance receivables of 939 million that can be specifically allocated to narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos 

liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements resulting in approximately 50 percent of these claims on a cumulative historical basis being reimbursable by insurance our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

defined benefit pension plans —we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of significant actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for actual and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

the key assumptions used in developing our 2007 2006 and 2005 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

 the discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rate as of the measurement date we will use a 650 percent discount rate in 2008 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2008 based principally on our historical experience of actual plan returns the net losses for our pension plans were 17 billion at december 31 2007 compared with 24 billion at december 31 2006 this decrease of 700 million is due primarily to lower net losses in our us plans due to a higher discount rate at december 31 2007 and loss amortization in 2007 the net losses at december 31 2007 principally result from the decline each year in the discount rate for the period 2002 through 2006 and from actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return during 2000 through 2002 such net losses were recognized as of december 31 2006 on our consolidated balance sheet and as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax in accordance with sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 158 which is discussed in detail in notes 1 and 22 to the financial statements in the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation the corridor are recognized over a sixyear period 

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table 

highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

 the sensitivities above regarding changes in the discount rate are applicable only when there are unrecognized losses outside of the corridor subject to amortization over a sixyear period at december 31 2007 there were no losses outside of the corridor subject to amortization in our us plans in the future if the discount rate were to increase from the current rate of 650 percent there would not be a significant change to annual pension expense only if the discount rate were to decrease to 625 would the sensitivities described in the table be applicable 

net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately 30 million in 2008 a 148 million decrease from 2007 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of net losses in our us plans the decline in the amortization of net losses results principally from an increase in the discount rate at december 31 2007 and actual plan asset returns higher than the expected rate of return in 2004 and 2006 

in 2007 2006 and 2005 we were not required to make a contribution to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans we made voluntary contributions of 42 and 68 million to our us pension plans in 2007 and 2006 respectively mainly for government contracting purposes future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2008 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future however we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 40 million in cash in 2008 to certain of our us pension plans for government contracting purposes we also expect to contribute approximately 125 million in cash in 2008 to our nonus defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets —to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2007 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 64 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

 once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying 

amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we use the best information available to determine fair value which are usually either market prices if available or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in the repositioning and other charges section of our mda we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 9 and 12 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively principally related to businesses in our specialty materials segment these businesses were significantly underperforming or were in industries with negative economic trends and subsequently these businesses were significantly restructured sold or are in the process of being sold 

goodwill impairment testing —goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 92 billion as of december 31 2007 is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in statement of financial accounting standards no 142 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach incorporating historic and projected future operating performance this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2007 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 

income taxes —deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

as of december 31 2007 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 1611 million less a valuation allowance of 490 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

our net deferred tax asset of 1611 million is comprised of 1095 million related to us operations and 516 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1095 million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 63 million against such asset related to capital losses and state tax net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 516 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in germany france and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 427 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance decreased by 26 million in 2007 and increased by 39 and 139 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such 

determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income or a credit to goodwill in the period that such determination is made if a valuation allowance is recognized for the net deferred tax asset for an acquired entity’s deductible temporary differences operating loss capital loss or tax credit carryforwards at the acquisition date the tax benefits for those items recognized after the acquisition date shall be applied first to reduce to zero goodwill related to the acquisition second to reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition and third to reduce income tax expense 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin 48” which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

as described in further detail in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements fin 48 was effective beginning january 1 2007 fin 48 establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition upon adoption as of january 1 2007 we reduced our existing reserves for uncertain tax positions by 33 million largely related to a reduction in state income tax matters partially offset by a net increase for federal and international tax reserves this reduction was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to shareholders’ equity additionally we decreased a deferred tax asset and its associated valuation allowance by 44 million and increased goodwill by 1 million 

sales recognition on longterm contracts —in 2007 we recognized approximately 13 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

honeywell management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports that honeywell files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed sumarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms there have been no changes that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of honeywell’s assets 

ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of honeywell’s management and directors and 

iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of honeywell’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 aerospace sales 

  our sales to aerospace customers were 35 percent of our total sales in 2006 and 38 percent of our total sales in each of 2005 and 2004 our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 10 9 and 8 percent of our total sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 15 and 16 percent of our total sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

  sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3688 3719 and 3464 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 3052 2939 and 2808 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively us defense spending increased in 2006 and is also expected to increase in 2007 we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2007 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

  our total backlog at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 10674 and 9327 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 8162 million of the 2006 backlog will be filled in 2007 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option 

competition 

  we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers 

international operations 

  we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 11 10 and 9 percent of our total sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 37 35 and 35 percent of our total sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  approximately 19 percent of total 2006 sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe canada asia and latin america foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 14 percent of total 2006 aerospace sales the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in canada and asia 

  approximately 2 percent of total 2006 sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 55 percent of total 2006 sales of automation and control solutions the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia canada and latin america 

  approximately 25 percent of total 2006 sales of specialty materials products were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia europe latin america and canada 

foreign manufactured products comprised 22 percent of total 2006 sales of specialty materials the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2006 sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 63 percent of total 2006 sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia latin america and canada 

financial information including net sales and longlived assets related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

  the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2006 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier we have no reason to believe there is any material risk to this supply 

  we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future 

  the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas benzene the key component in phenol and fluorspar in our specialty materials business steel and nickel in our transportation systems business and nickel titanium and other metals in our aerospace business were at historically high levels in 2006 and are expected to remain at high price levels in addition in 2006 certain large longterm fixed supplier price agreements expired primarily relating to components used by our aerospace business which in the aggregate subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula price agreements price increases and hedging activities where feasible we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2007 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

  our reportable segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

  we have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services including honeywell uop prestone fram autolite bendix jurid holts garrett ademco firelite notifier system sensor mk novar genetron enovate spectra aclar simoniz and redex 

research and development 

  our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products the company has research and development activities in the us europe india and china 

  research and development rd expense totaled 1411 1072 and 917 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in rd expense in 2006 compared to 2005 of 32 percent was primarily due to the impact of additional rd expense for uop in specialty materials as well as product design and development costs in aerospace and automation and control solutions the increase in research and development expense in 2005 compared with 2004 of 17 percent resulted primarily from design and developments costs associated with new aircraft platforms in aerospace and new product development costs in automation and control solutions customersponsored principally the us government rd activities amounted to an additional 777 694 and 593 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

environment 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

  we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

  among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

  further information including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters if any is included in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

  we have approximately 118000 employees at december 31 2006 of which approximately 56000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

  we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the discussion of economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2007 for the company andor each of our segments these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

  forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

  our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

  the operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production andor the retirement of older aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed in other risk factors below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline consolidation airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns and changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion and material price inflation specialty materials operating results which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006 are impacted by global gross domestic product and capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining and petrochemical plants transportation systems operating results which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006 are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and consumer spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products 

raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials fluorspar benzene the key component in phenol and natural gas transportation systems nickel and steel and aerospace nickel titanium and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations 

  our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and applicable laws and regulations we also depend in limited instances on sole source suppliers our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes or governmental actions our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

  our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively 

  our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

  protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own or are licensed under a large number of us and foreign patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

  our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india and the middle east in 2006 48 percent of our total sales 

including products manufactured in the us and in international locations were outside of the us including 28 percent in europe and 10 percent in asia risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions including embargoes changes in regulations regarding transactions with stateowned enterprises nationalization of private enterprises government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

as we continue to grow our businesses internationally our operating results could be effected by the relative strength of the european and asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets 

  at december 31 2006 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 145 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess our longlived assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospaces defense and spacerelated product and services 

  sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the u s department of defense comprised approximately 27 and 10 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 although us defense spending increased in 2006 and is expected to increase again in 2007 we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2008 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the u s government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

  in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the 

industry changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

  the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of fluorocarbons safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned and divestitures may not occur as planned 

  we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities iii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies within the plan and timeframe andor iv the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected time frame 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties 

  we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability including asbestos prior acquisitions and divestitures employment employee benefits plans and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the 

impact of evidentiary requirements and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and income benefits 

  with approximately 118000 employees including 56000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and income benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs and changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and income benefit expenses may affect our future profitability 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2006 our tax expense represented 257 percent of our income before tax and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  not applicable 




 item 2 properties 

  we have approximately 1300 locations consisting of plants research laboratories sales offices and other facilities our headquarters and administrative complex is located at morris township new jersey our plants are generally located to serve large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials 

and labor pools our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business conditions however no major operating facility is significantly idle we own or lease warehouses railroad cars barges automobiles trucks airplanes and materials handling and data processing equipment we also lease space for administrative and sales staffs our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs we do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities 

our principal plants which are owned in fee unless otherwise indicated are as follows 

 


 item 3 legal proceedings 

  we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising out of the conduct of our business see a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 

  as previously reported three incidents occurred during 2003 at honeywells baton rouge louisiana chemical plant including a release of chlorine a release of antimony pentachloride which resulted in an employee fatality and an employee exposure to hydrofluoric acid the united states environmental protection agency and the united states department of justice have conducted investigations of these incidents including a federal grand jury convened to investigate the employee fatality as a result of that investigation we have signed a plea agreement with the us attorney under which honeywell will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and pay 12 million in combined restitution and fines the plea agreement has been filed but the plea and the sentence still are subject to court acceptance which we expect to receive honeywell has been served with several civil lawsuits 

regarding these incidents for which we believe we have adequate insurance coverage to the extent that there is any liability we are also engaged in discussions with the louisiana department of environmental quality ladeq to resolve alleged civil environmental violations at our baton rouge and geismar louisiana facilities that in part overlap with the subject of the federal investigation

consolidated results of operations 

net sales 

   the change in net sales in 2006 and 2005 is attributable to the following 

   a discussion of net sales by reportable segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

   gross margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher margins in our specialty materials segment following our acquisition of full ownership of uop 13 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 05 percentage points partially offset by higher repositioning costs of 02 percentage points gross margin increased by 33 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to an increase of 12 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments lower repositioning and other charges of 08 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 05 percentage points for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

selling general and administrative expenses 

   selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was flat in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to a reduction in expenses in our aerospace segment which reflects the benefit of prior restructuring actions offsetting higher expenses in automation and control solutions acs and specialty materials as a result of acquisitions a reduction of repositioning and pension costs of 02 percentage points offset the 02 percentage point increase for expenses of 77 million relating to stockbased compensation expense following the adoption of fas no 123r see note 20 stockbased compensation plans selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 04 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of novar and higher spending for information technology systems primarily erp system in aerospace of 03 percentage points and higher repositioning and other charges of 01 percentage points 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

   pension expense decreased by 23 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of net losses principally in our us plans pension expense decreased by 2 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of net losses partially offset by pension expense for novar which was acquired in 2005 

  other postretirement benefits expense decreased by 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to favorable demographic experience in the plan and by 27 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the effect of implementing the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion 

other incomeexpense 

   other income decreased by 120 million or 52 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 121 million reduction in equity income of affiliated companies primarily related to uop following our acquisition of full ownership of uop in november 2005 in 2005 other income decreased by 198 million compared to 2004 or 46 percent compared to 2004 primarily as a result of pretax gains on the sales of our security monitoring and vcsel optical products businesses of 215 and 36 million respectively and recognition of a gain of 27 million related to the favorable settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 

interest and other financial charges 

   interest and other financial charges increased by 5 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to higher debt balances and higher borrowing costs and increased by 8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due to both higher average shortterm debt outstanding and higher interest rates in 2005 

tax expense 

   the effective tax rate decreased by 62 percentage points in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to the absence of the 2005 onetime tax charge of 155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 offset in part by 64 million of tax benefits associated with the 2005 sale of our industrial wax business which had a higher tax basis than book basis in addition in 2006 there were benefits recognized from the favorable resolution of certain tax audits offset by a tax charge for an upfront licensing of certain inprocess research and development the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits derived from export sales lower foreign taxes and benefits from tax planning strategies the effective tax rate increased by 87 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to the tax impact of the repatriation of approximately 27 billion of foreign earnings of which 22 billion was subject to a significantly reduced tax under the american jobs creation act of 2004 offset in part by the higher effective tax benefit rate for repositioning and other charges that were incurred in 2004 see note 6 to the financial statements for further information on taxes including a detailed effective tax rate reconciliation 

  in 2007 the effective tax rate could change based upon the companys operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various federal state and foreign tax authorities several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future the company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period that they are resolved 

income from continuing operations 

   the increase of 067 in earnings diluted per share for continuing operations in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily relates to an increase in segment profit in aerospace and automation and control solutions and income generated from our acquisition of full ownership of uop in specialty materials reduced repositioning and pension costs and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to the previously announced stock repurchase program offset by the impact of adopting fas no 123r “sharebased payment” for stockbased compensation expense of 77 million in 2006 in addition in 2005 there was a onetime tax charge of 155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which decreased earnings and earnings per share in 2005 the increase of 039 earnings diluted per share for continuing operations in 2005 compared with 2004 relates primarily to an increase in segment profit for our reportable segments for further discussion of segment results see “review of business segments” 

income from discontinued operations 

  income from discontinued operations of 5 million or 001 earnings per share diluted in 2006 relates to the operating results of the indalex business which was sold in february 2006 to sun capital partners inc income from discontinued operations of 95 million or 011 earnings per share in 2005 relates to the operating results of the indalex and security printing businesses that were part of our novar acquisition that were subsequently divested in december 2005 the security printing business was sold to mf worldwide corp see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of these sales

  results of operations 

   acs sales increased by 17 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to organic sales growth of 10 percent and 7 percent growth from acquisitions net of divestitures all of acs businesses contributed to organic growth in the year in 2005 sales increased by 17 percent compared to 2004 which was primarily due to growth from acquisitions of 13 percent and organic growth of 4 percent 

  organic sales growth in acs products businesses increased by 8 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to strong customer demand for new products in our security and life safety products and increased sales to customers in emerging markets for environmental combustion sensing and control products in 2005 organic sales for products increased by 5 percent compared to 2004 primarily due to strong sales of fire solutions and security products and the favorable effects of foreign exchange 

  organic sales in acs solutions businesses increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 driven by continued strong orders growth strong conversion to sales from our order backlog and increased sales in emerging markets and strong revenue from energy projects in 2005 organic sales growth for the solutions businesses was 3 percent compared to 2004 due primarily to favorable foreign exchange and increased capital spending 

  sales from acquisitions net of divestitures increased by 7 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 largely representing revenues in acs products businesses relating to novar primarily environmental combustion building controls and life safety products for the first quarter of 2006 zellweger gas detection for the first two quarters of 2006 and revenues from our gardiner groupe security distribution and first technology gas detection acquisitions in the last three quarters of 2006 in 2005 sales from acquisitions net of divestitures increased by 13 percent compared to 2004 due primarily to the acquisition of novar partially offset by the loss of sales due to the divestiture of our security monitoring business 

  acs segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to increased sales volume and productivity savings including net integration savings from our acquisitions that more than offset continued inflation segment profit was also negatively impacted in 2006 by a contract loss experienced on a building solutions project and by erp implementation costs acs segment profit in 2005 increased by 19 percent compared with 2004 as the favorable effects of productivity actions acquisitions novar and higher sales volume more than offset the unfavorable effects of lower prices and investments in sales and marketing initiatives 

  2007 areas of focus 

  acss primary areas of focus for 2007 include 

 specialty materials 

  overview 

  specialty materials develops and manufactures highpurity highquality and highperformance chemicals and materials for applications in the automotive healthcare agricultural packaging carpet fibers refrigeration appliance housing semiconductor wax and adhesives segments specialty 

materials also provides process technology products and services for the petroleum refining petrochemical and other industries specialty materials product portfolio includes fluorocarbons caprolactam ammonium sulfate for fertilizer specialty films advanced fibers customized research chemicals and intermediates electronic materials and chemicals catalysts and adsorbents 

  economic and other factors 

  specialty materials operating results are principally driven by 

   results of operations 

   specialty materials sales increased by 43 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to organic sales growth of 7 percent and 36 percent growth due to our uop acquisition net of divestitures sales decreased by 8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the loss of sales from divested businesses of 16 percent which was offset by organic growth of 4 percent and growth from acquisitions uop of 4 percent 

  organic growth was 7 percent in 2006 primarily due to higher volume and prices organic sales in our fluorine products business increased by 9 percent due to continued strong demand for nonozone depleting hfc products and organic growth in our resins and chemicals business was 4 percent primarily due to price increases to recover increased raw material costs both of these businesses experienced lower sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to the slowdown in the us residential housing industry our resins and chemicals business was also negatively impacted by a partial facility outage in the second half of 2006 specialty products organic sales increased by 10 percent due to higher sales to our customers in the semiconductor industry and increased sales of our specialty additives and our advanced fiber body armor in 2005 organic sales increased by 4 percent largely as a result of higher prices of 7 percent primarily in our resins and chemicals and fluorine businesses offsetting lower volumes in specialty products businesses 

  sales from acquisitions net of divestitures grew by 36 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 this was due to a 44 percent growth in sales from uop which was consolidated into the specialty materials segment following our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in uop in november 2005 prior to that date uop results were included in other income uop sales have grown due to continued strength in the petrochemical and refining industries this growth was offset by the loss of sales of 8 percent principally from the divestiture of our industrial wax and north american nylon fiber businesses 

  specialty materials segment profit increased by 121 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to the impact of the uop acquisition net of divestitures and increased organic growth and productivity savings net of the lost margin from the partial facility outage price increases including benefits from formula based pricing contracts offset the impact of continued inflation in raw material costs specialty materials segment profit in 2005 increased by 40 percent compared with 2004 due principally to price increases and the favorable effect of productivity actions partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes

  economic and other factors 

  transportation systems operating results are principally driven by 

   results of operations 

   transportation systems sales increased 2 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to increased sales in our turbo technologies business offset by lower sales in our consumer products group in 2005 sales increased by 4 percent compared with 2004 due primarily to favorable sales mix of 2 percent the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 1 percent and the impact of higher prices of 1 percent 

  sales for our turbo technologies business were 6 percent higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to new product introductions in europe and asia a slight increase in diesel penetration in europe and relatively flat sales in the us sales were 5 percent higher in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher volumes in our north american truck segment offset by lower volumes in europe due to a shift in consumer demand among automotive platforms partially offset by a slight increase in diesel penetration 

  sales for our consumer products group business decreased by 4 percent in 2006 as a result of reduced consumer spending in north america on automotive aftermarket products and our exit of the north america friction materials oe business sales increased by 8 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 

largely due to higher prices offset by the impact of our exit in late 2005 from the north american friction materials oe business 

  transportation systems segment profit increased by 3 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to increased turbo technologies volume and productivity savings including the benefits of prior year restructuring actions which offset higher material and labor inflation and increased warranty expense transportation systems segment profit in 2005 decreased by 3 percent compared with 2004 due primarily to the impact of higher raw material costs mainly steel and nickel and operating costs associated with the exit from north american friction materials oe business in late 2005 partially offset by the effects of higher prices and productivity actions

liquidity and capital resources 

  the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity we supplement operating cash with shortterm debt from the commercial paper market and with longterm borrowings we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses acquisition activity share repurchases and dividends 

cash flow summary 

  our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized as follows

liquidity 

  each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2007 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

  a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 270 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 669 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2006 

  our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and our 25 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities revolving credit facilities our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies in 2006 standard and poors fitchs and moodys rating services affirmed their corporate ratings on our longterm debt of a and a and a2 respectively and shortterm debt of a1 f1 and p1 respectively and maintained honeywells ratings outlook as “stable” 

  on april 27 2006 honeywell entered into a 23 billion fiveyear credit agreement “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed 3 billion this credit facility contains a 500 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the 23 billion credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper we had no borrowings and have issued 145 million of letters of credit under the credit facility at december 31 2006 the credit agreement replaces the previous 1 billion five year credit agreement dated as of october 22 2004 and 13 billion five year credit agreement dated as of november 26 2003 the “prior agreements” the credit agreement does not restrict honeywells ability to pay dividends nor does it contain financial covenants 

  in september 2006 the company renewed its 364day canadian dollar cad credit facility for 220 million cad this facility was established for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper in canada there are no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at december 31 2006 

  in march 2006 the company issued 300 million of floating rate libor  6 bps senior notes due 2009 400 million 540 senior notes due 2016 and 550 million 570 senior notes due 2036 collectively the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of honeywell and rank equally with all of honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all honeywells subordinated debt the offering resulted in gross proceeds of 1250 million offset by 11 million in discount and closing costs relating to the offering proceeds from the notes were used to repay commercial paper and debt 

  during the first quarter of 2006 the company made a cash tender offer and repurchased 225 million of its 500 million 5125 notes due november 2006 the costs relating to the early redemption of the notes were immaterial 

  in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company repaid 360 million euro 275 million of its 527 notes primarily through issuance of commercial paper 

  we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to issue up to 3 billion in debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

  we also sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables were overcollateralized by 171 million at december 31 2006 and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools new receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are collected the retained interests in the receivables are reflected at the amounts expected to be collected by us and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests the sold receivables were 500 million at both december 31 2006 and 2005 

  in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

  specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2007 to be as follows 

   we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2006 we realized 665 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

  based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the 

public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

  following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2006 

 

   the table excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations we made voluntary contributions of 68 and 40 million to our us pension plans in 2006 and 2004 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2007 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 52 million to our us plans in 2007 for government contracting purposes we expect to make contributions to our nonus plans of approximately 155 million in 2007 payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 189 million in 2007 net of the benefit of approximately 22 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

  guarantees —we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2006 

   we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

  retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables —as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2006 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible at december 31 2006 our retained subordinated and undivided interests at risk were 171 and 579 million respectively based on the underlying credit quality of the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold we do not expect that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

  with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given 

the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our accrual we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects execution timeframe of projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 264 247 and 248 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 250 million in 2007 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 210 186 and 536 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 the recorded liability for environmental matters was 831 and 879 million respectively in addition in 2006 and 2005 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 101 and 87 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

  although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

  see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

  as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 to the financial statements 

  we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to have all transaction exposures hedged with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the us dollar euro british pound the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the chinese renminbi and the singapore dollar 

  our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and pension obligations as described in notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

  financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative 

instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

  the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

   the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

critical accounting policies 

  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

  we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public 

accountants new accounting standards effective in 2006 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 to the financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  contingent liabilities— we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies relate to product liabilities including asbestos contractual matters and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including new discovery of fact changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements 

  asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoveries— we are a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos containing products refractory products and friction products we recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable regarding north american refractories company narco asbestos related claims we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants we have also accrued for the probable value of future narco asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the narco trust as described in note 21 to the financial statements in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018 under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 5 regarding bendix asbestos related claims we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and dismissal rates in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company accrued a liability for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to bendix through 2011 based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system in december 2006 we also changed our methodology for valuing bendix pending and future claims from using average resolution values of the previous five years to using average resolution values of the previous two years for additional information relating to bendix related claims see note 21 to the financial statements we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts 

  in connection with recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers at december 31 2006 we have recorded insurance receivables of 955 million that can be specifically allocated to narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements resulting in approximately 50 percent of these claims on a cumulative historical basis being reimbursable by insurance our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of 

our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

  defined benefit pension plans— we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of significant actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 to the financial statements for actual and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 measurement date for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in note 22 to the financial statements 

  the key assumptions used in developing our 2006 2005 and 2004 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

   the reduction in the discount rate in both 2006 and 2005 reflects the lower market interest rate environment for highquality fixed income debt instruments the discount rate is also volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rate as of the measurement date we will use a 600 percent discount rate in 2007 reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2007 based principally on our historical experience of actual plan returns the net losses for our pension plans were 24 billion at december 31 2006 compared with 34 billion at december 31 2005 this decrease of 10 billion is due primarily to lower net losses in our us plans due to a higher discount rate at december 31 2006 an actual plan asset return of 14 in 2006 in our us plans which was higher than the expected rate of return of 9 and loss amortization in 2006 the net losses at december 31 2006 principally result from the decline each year in the discount rate for the period 2001 through 2005 and from actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return during 2000 2001 2002 and 2005 such net losses were recognized as of december 31 2006 on our consolidated balance sheet and as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax in accordance with sfas no 158 “employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 158 which is discussed in detail in notes 1 and 22 to the financial statements in the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over a sixyear period 

  changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table 

highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

   net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately 200 million in 2007 a 113 million decrease from 2006 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of net losses the decline in the amortization of net losses results principally from an increase in the discount rate at december 31 2006 and actual plan asset returns higher than the expected rate of return in 2004 and 2006 

  in 2006 2005 and 2004 we were not required to make a contribution to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans we made voluntary contributions of 68 and 40 million to our us pension plans in 2006 and 2004 respectively mainly for government contracting purposes future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2007 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future however we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 52 million in cash in 2007 to certain of our us pension plans for government contracting purposes we also expect to contribute approximately 155 million in cash in 2007 to our nonus defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards 

  longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets— to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2006 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 59 billion the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

   once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we use the best information available to determine fair value which are usually either market prices if available or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in the repositioning and other charges section of our mda we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 12 and 23 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively principally related to businesses in our specialty materials reportable segment these businesses were 

significantly underperforming or were in industries with negative economic trends and subsequently these businesses were significantly restructured sold or are in the process of being sold 

  goodwill impairment testing— goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing our goodwill balance 84 billion as of december 31 2006 is subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in statement of financial accounting standards no 142 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value is reduced to fair value the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach incorporating historic and projected future operating performance this impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we completed our annual impairment test as of march 31 2006 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 

  income taxes— deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

  as of december 31 2006 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 2414 million less a valuation allowance of 516 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

  our net deferred tax asset of 2414 million is comprised of 1624 million related to us operations and 790 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1624 million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 35 million against such asset related to state tax net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 790 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in germany france and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 481 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 6 to the financial statements our valuation allowance increased by 39 139 and 39 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income or a credit to goodwill in the period that such determination is made if a valuation allowance is recognized for the net deferred tax asset for an acquired entitys deductible temporary differences operating loss capital loss or tax credit carryforwards at the acquisition date the tax benefits for those items recognized after the acquisition date shall be applied first to reduce to zero goodwill related to the 

acquisition second to reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition and third to reduce income tax expense 

  significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  as described in further detail in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement 109” is effective beginning january 1 2007 fin 48 establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 honeywell will adopt fin 48 as of january 1 2007 as required based on our current assessment and subject to any changes that may result from additional technical guidance being issued the adoption of fin 48 on january 1 2007 is expected to reduce our existing reserves for uncertain tax positions by approximately 130 million to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to equity largely relating to state income tax matters 

  sales recognition on longterm contracts— in 2006 we recognized approximately 12 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials reportable segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses

aerospace sales 

  our sales to aerospace customers were 38 percent of our total sales in each of 2005 2004 and 2003 our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 9 8 and 7 percent of our total sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 15 16 and 15 percent of our total sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions see “item 1a risk factors” 

us government sales 

  sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3719 3464 and 3111 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2939 2808 and 2564 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively us defense spending increased in 2005 and is also expected to increase in 2006 we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2006 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us oem production engineering development programs aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs our contracts with the us government are subject to audits investigations and termination by the government see “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

  our total backlog at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 9327 and 8229 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 7594 million of the 2005 backlog will be filled in 2006 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option 

competition 

  we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers 

international operations 

  we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 10 and 9 percent of our total net sales in 2005 and 2004 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 35 percent of our total net sales in both 2005 and 2004 

  approximately 20 percent of total 2005 net sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe asia and canada foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised 14 percent of total 2005 aerospace net sales 

  approximately 2 percent of total 2005 net sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 53 percent of total 2005 net sales of automation and control solutions the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe and mexico with less significant operations in asia and canada 

  approximately 13 percent of total 2005 net sales of specialty materials products were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia europe latin america and canada foreign manufactured products comprised 18 percent of total 2005 net sales of specialty materials the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

  exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2005 net sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 60 percent of total 2005 net sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia latin america and canada 

  financial information related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” information regarding the economic political regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in “item 1a risk factors” 

raw materials 

  the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2005 except related to phenol a raw material used in our specialty materials segment we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials we purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier we have no reason to believe there is any material risk to this supply 

  we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future 

  the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas and benzene in our specialty materials business were at historically high levels in 2005 and are expected to remain at those levels in 2006 we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula price agreements and price increases where feasible at present we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2006 see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

  our businesses are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business see “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion 

  we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram autolite bendix jurid holts and garrett 

research and development 

  our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes and the development of new uses for existing products 

  research and development expense totaled 1072 917 and 751 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in research and development expense in 2004 compared with 2003 resulted primarily from design and developments costs associated with new aircraft platforms in aerospace and new product development costs in automation and control solutions customersponsored principally the us government research and development activities amounted to an additional 694 593 and 608 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

environment 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

  we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

  among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

  further information regarding environmental matters is included in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

  we have approximately 116000 employees at december 31 2005 of which approximately 58000 were located in the united states 




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

  we have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including under the headings “economic and other factors” “areas of focus” and “review of business segments” these sections and other parts of this report including this item 1a contain 

“forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

  forwardlooking statements are those that address activities events or developments that management intends expects projects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends current conditions expected future developments and other relevant factors they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forwardlooking statements we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the nearand longterm these forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10k including in particular the factors discussed below 

risk factors 

  our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 

  the operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs the operating results of our aerospace segment which generated 38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2005 are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production andor the retirement of older aircraft global flying hours and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates as well as the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed below the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline insolvencies terrorism and safety concerns and changes in regulations future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment which generated 34 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2005 are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades capital spending on building and process automation industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion and material price inflation specialty materials operating results are impacted by global gross domestic product and capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining and petrochemical plants transportation systems operating results are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers and consumer spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products because approximately 28 percent of our sales are in europe the relative strength of the european economy and exchange rate fluctuations impact our sales and margins 

raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products particularly in our specialty materials benzene and natural gas and transportation systems steel and other metals segments our inability to offset material price inflation with pricing or productivity actions could adversely affect our results of operations 

  our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions quality standards and 

applicable laws and regulations we also depend in limited instances on sole source suppliers our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to mitigate the consequences of their nonperformance the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions labor disputes or governmental actions our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts which could in turn result in reduced sales and profits contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

  our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and iv develop manufacture and bring products to market quickly and costeffectively 

  our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance or their obsolescence due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 

  protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own or are licensed under a large number of us and foreign patents and patent applications trademarks and copyrights our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms in some nonus countries laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 

an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in nonus jurisdictions and is subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

  our international operations including us exports comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china india and the middle east as this trend continues our exposure to the risks attendant to international operations also increases these risks include fluctuations in currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions including embargoes and government instability the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets 

  at december 31 2005 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 143 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess our longlived assets to determine if they are 

impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in charges to goodwill and other asset impairments future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareowners equity and increase our debttototalcapitalization ratio which could negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets 

a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospaces defense and spacerelated product and services 

  sales of our defense and spacerelated products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets particularly the us defense budget sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the u s department of defense comprised approximately 28 and 11 percent of aerospace and total sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 although us defense spending increased in 2005 and is expected to increase again in 2006 we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2007 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift in defense spending to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 

as a supplier of military and other equipment to the u s government we are subject to unusual risks such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 

  in addition to normal business risks companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

  our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 

  us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 

  we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings the us 

government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 

  the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales research and development expenditures operating costs and profitability the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products services and solutions can be impacted by fire security safety health care and energy efficiency standards and regulations specialty materials results of operations can be affected by environmental eg government regulation of refrigerants safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment 

completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned 

  we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns ii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule andor to achieve synergies within the plan and timeframe andor iii the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected time frame 

we cannot predict the outcome of litigation matters government proceedings and other contingencies with certainty 

  we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions government contracts product liability prior acquisitions and divestitures employee benefits plans and environmental health and safety matters resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain moreover our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows liquidity and financial condition 

our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures we have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations can 

impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising out of the conduct of our business see a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 

  as previously reported three incidents occurred during 2003 at honeywells baton rouge louisiana chemical plant including a release of chlorine a release of antimony pentachloride which resulted in an employee fatality and an employee exposure to hydrofluoric acid honeywell has been served with several civil lawsuits regarding these incidents for which we believe we have adequate insurance coverage in addition the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the united states department of justice usdoj are conducting investigations of these incidents including a federal grand jury convened to investigate the employee fatality honeywell has been informed by the usdoj that it is a potential target of the grand jury investigation if we are ultimately charged with wrongdoing the baton rouge facility could be deemed ineligible to supply products or services under government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows 

  honeywell is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the arizona attorney generals office on behalf of the arizona department of environmental quality adeq the complaint alleges various environmental violations and failure to make required disclosures honeywell believes that the allegations in this matter are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit in september 2004 the court partially dismissed several of the adeqs significant allegations in november 2005 the court dismissed the most significant remaining claims in adeqs amended complaint we do not believe that this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows

  contingent liabilities— we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies relate to product liabilities including asbestos commercial transactions government contracts and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future where estimable asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental asbestos and other matters including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  insurance for asbestos related liabilities— in connection with recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers we have approximately 12 billion in insurance coverage remaining that can be specifically allocated to north american refractories company narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 

19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements resulting in approximately 50 percent of these claims on a cumulative historical basis being reimbursable by insurance our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

  defined benefit pension plans— we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets we consider current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for actual and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longterm assumption and generally does not change annually the discount rate reflects the market rate on our annual measurement date december 31 for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year the expected rate of return on pension assets and discount rate were determined in accordance with consistent methodologies further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  the key assumptions used in developing our 2005 2004 and 2003 net periodic pension expense for our us plans included the following 

   the reduction in the discount rate in both 2005 and 2004 reflects the lower market interest rate environment for highquality fixed income debt instruments the discount rate is also volatile because it is determined based upon the prevailing rate as of the measurement date due to continuing declines in interest rates we will use a 575 percent discount rate in 2006 we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2006 the unrecognized net losses for our us pension plans were 26 billion at both december 31 2005 and 2004 as a decrease in unrecognized net losses due to loss amortization in 2005 was offset by additional unrecognized net losses due to the lower discount rate and the adoption of the rp2000 mortality table as of december 31 2005 the unrecognized net losses at december 31 2005 principally result from the decline each year since 2001 in the discount rate and from actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return during 2000 2001 2002 and 2005 such unrecognized net losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further unrecognized net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over a sixyear period 

  changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

   net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately 320 million in 2006 a 84 million decrease from 2005 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of unrecognized net losses the decline in the amortization of unrecognized net losses results principally from actual plan asset returns higher than the expected rate of return in 2003 and 2004 

  in 2005 2004 and 2003 we were not required to make a contribution to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans we made voluntary contributions of 40 and 670 million to our us pension plans in 2004 and 2003 respectively the 2003 voluntary contribution was made to improve the funded status of the plans which had been impacted by the poor performance of the equity markets during the threeyear period ended december 31 2002 as well as the declining interest rate environment future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2006 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future however we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 45 million in cash in 2006 to certain of our us pension plans for government contracting purposes we also expect to contribute approximately 150 million in cash in 2006 to our nonus defined benefit pension plans primarily related to funding requirements of recently acquired companies 

  longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets— to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2005 the net carrying amount of these longlived assets totaled 6527 million the determination of useful lives for depreciationamortization purposes and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions which bear the risk of change which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows 

   once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value we use the best information available to determine fair value which are usually either market prices if available or an estimate of the future discounted cash 

flow the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates our assumptions as to volume selling prices and costs and the discount rate selected as described in more detail in the repositioning and other charges section of our mda we have recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 23 and 42 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively principally related to our performance fibers research and life sciences and resins and chemicals businesses in our specialty materials reportable segment these businesses were significantly underperforming or were in industries with negative economic trends and subsequently these businesses were sold or significantly restructured 

  income taxes— as of december 31 2005 we recognized a net deferred tax asset of 1706 million less a valuation allowance of 477 million net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 

  our net deferred tax asset of 1706 million is comprised of 1102 million related to us operations and 604 million related to nonus operations the us net deferred tax asset of 1102 million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the us and tax planning strategies we maintain a valuation allowance of 39 million against such asset related to state tax net operating losses the nonus net deferred tax asset of 604 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards mainly in germany france and the united kingdom we maintain a valuation allowance of 438 million against such net asset reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods as more fully described in note 7 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” our valuation allowance increased by 139 39 and 108 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income or a credit to goodwill in the period that such determination is made if a valuation allowance is recognized for the net deferred tax asset for an acquired entitys deductible temporary differences operating loss capital loss or tax credit carryforwards at the acquisition date the tax benefits for those items recognized after the acquisition date shall be applied first to reduce to zero goodwill related to the acquisition second to reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition and third to reduce income tax expense 

  sales recognition on longterm contracts— in 2005 we recognized approximately 10 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions and aerospace reportable segments these longterm contracts are measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary 

trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses 

  aerospace sales incentives— consistent with other suppliers to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines we provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units for installation on commercial aircraft these incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products product credits and upfront cash payments the cost of these incentives are capitalized in the case of auxiliary power units only when we are the sole source supplier at the time we deliver the products to our customers or in the case of product credits at the time the credit is issued or in the case of upfront cash payments at the time the payment is made in the case of free or deeply discounted product the cost to manufacture less any amount recovered from the airframe manufacturer or airline is capitalized product credits and upfront cash payments are capitalized at exchanged value research design development and qualification costs related to these products are expensed as incurred unless contractually guaranteed of reimbursement the cost of the sales incentives described above is capitalized because the selection of our aircraft wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units for installation on commercial aircraft results in the creation of future revenues and cash flows through aftermarket sales to fulfill longterm product maintenance requirements mandated by the federal aviation administration faa and other similar international organizations over the useful life of the aircraft once our products are certified and selected on an aircraft the recovery of our investment is virtually guaranteed over the useful life of the aircraft the likelihood of displacement by an alternative supplier is remote due to contractual solesourcing the high cost to alternative suppliers and aircraft operators of product retrofits andor rigorous regulatory specifications qualification and testing requirements amounts capitalized at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 803 776 and 719 million respectively and are being amortized over their useful lives on a straightline basis up to 25 years representing the estimated minimum service life of the aircraft this useful life is the period over which we are virtually assured to earn revenues from the aftermarket sales of certified products necessary to fulfill the maintenance required by the faa and other similar international organizations we classify the amortization expense associated with free and discounted products as cost of goods sold and the amortization expense associated with product credits and upfront cash payments as a reduction of sales we regularly evaluate the recoverability of capitalized amounts whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the incentives may not be fully recoverable there were no impairment charges related to these capitalized incentives recognized during 2005 2004 and 2003 for additional information see notes 1 and 13 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

results of operations 

net sales 

 25

  the change in net sales in 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the following 

   a discussion of net sales by reportable segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda 

cost of products and services sold 

   gross margin increased in 2005 by 28 percentage points compared with 2004 the increase resulted from an increase of 11 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments see review of business segments for a discussion of our segment results the increase also resulted from lower repositioning and other charges of 12 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 05 percentage points gross margin decreased in 2004 by 15 percentage points compared with 2003 the decrease resulted primarily from an increase in repositioning and other charges of 12 percentage points and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 09 percentage points partially offset by an increase of 06 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments see review of business segments for a discussion of our segment results 

selling general and administrative expenses 

   selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 04 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of novar and higher spending for information technology systems primarily erp system in aerospace of 03 percentage points and higher repositioning and other charges of 01 percentage points selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 02 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003 due to increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and net repositioning and other charges of 02 and 01 percentage points respectively partially offset by a decrease of 01 percentage points due primarily to higher sales 

 26

  pension expense decreased by 8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of unrecognized net losses partially offset by pension expense for novar which was acquired in 2005 pension expense increased by 276 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in the amortization of unrecognized net losses resulting mainly from actual plan asset returns below the expected rate of return during the period 2000 to 2002 and a decrease in the discount rate for each year since 2001 

  other postretirement benefits expense decreased by 59 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 see note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion 

gain loss on sale of nonstrategic businesses 

   gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 36 million in 2005 represents pretax gains totaling 66 million consisting of postclosing adjustments of 43 million related principally to the sales of our performance fibers and security monitoring businesses in the prior year and a pretax gain of 23 million related to the sale of our north american nylon carpet fiber business partially offset by a pretax loss of 30 million related to the sale of our industrial wax business the dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2005 compared with 2004 gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 255 million in 2004 represented the pretax gains on the sales of our security monitoring and vcsel optical products businesses of 215 and 36 million respectively and postclosing adjustments of 19 million related to businesses sold in prior periods the total pretax gain of 270 million was partially offset by the pretax loss of 15 million on the sale of our performance fibers business the dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2004 compared with 2003

business impairment charges 

   see note 3 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of business impairment charges 

equity in income loss of affiliated companies 

   equity income increased by 52 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher earnings of 36 million from our uop process technology joint venture uop due to strength in the refining and petrochemical industries and a gain of 15 million on the sale of an equity investment effective november 30 2005 we purchased the remaining 50 percent interest in uop and 

consolidated their results of operations as of that date equity income increased by 44 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an improvement in earnings from uop 

other income expense 

   other income decreased by 31 million in 2005 compared with 2004 as the prior year included a gain of 27 million related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and the current year included a charge of 10 million for the modification of a lease agreement related to the corporate headquarters facility other income increased by 111 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due principally to a decrease in foreign exchange losses of 93 million due to a reduction in foreign exchange exposures resulting in losses in 2003 due to a weak us dollar a gain of 27 million related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and an increase in interest income of 13 million from higher cash balances partially offset by the inclusion of a gain of 20 million in the prior year related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 

interest and other financial charges 

   interest and other financial charges increased by 8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to both higher average shortterm debt outstanding and higher interest rates in the current year interest and other financial charges decreased by 1 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due principally to lower average shortterm debt outstanding in 2004 

tax expense 

   the effective tax rate increased by 81 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to the tax impact of our decision to repatriate approximately 27 billion of foreign earnings of which 22 billion receives the benefit under the american jobs creation act of 2004 excluding this item and the impact of gains and losses on sales of nonstrategic businesses in both years our effective tax rate increased by 65 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 this increase is due principally to a higher effective tax benefit rate on environmental litigation net repositioning and other charges in the prior year the effective tax rate increased by 58 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003 principally due to the fact that the effective tax rate in 2003 included tax benefits expected to be realized as a result of the redesignation of our friction materials business from held for sale to held and used resulting from the termination of disposition discussions with federalmogul corp 

  excluding the impact of cash repatriation gains and losses on sales of nonstrategic businesses tax benefits associated with the redesignation of our friction materials business and environmental litigation net repositioning and other charges the effective tax rate in 2005 2004 and 2003 was 265 percent this rate was lower than the statutory rate in those years due in part to benefits from export sales foreign taxes and favorable audit settlements see note 7 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further information on taxes including a detailed effective tax rate reconciliation 

income from continuing operations 

   the increase of 037 per share in 2005 compared with 2004 relates primarily to an increase in segment profit for our reportable segments see review of business segments for a discussion of our segment results the decrease of 007 per share in 2004 compared with 2003 relates primarily to increased charges for environmental matters primarily attributable to the denial of our appeal in the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v honeywell international inc et al see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense partially offset by an increase in segment profit 

income from discontinued operations 

  income from discontinued operations of 95 million or 011 per share in 2005 relates to the operating results of the indalex and security printing businesses which have been classified as discontinued operations in december 2005 the security printing business was sold to mf worldwide corp in february 2006 the indalex business was sold to sun capital partners inc see note 2 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of these sales

  trends which may impact aerospace operating results in 2006 include 

 automation and control solutions 

   automation and control solutions sales in 2005 increased by 17 percent compared with 2004 due to acquisitions mainly novars ibs business net of divestitures of 13 percent higher volumes of 4 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 1 percent partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent sales increased by 26 percent for our products businesses driven primarily by the acquisition of novars ibs business the increase was also due to volume growth and other acquisitions in our security and life safety businesses sales for our building solutions business increased by 10 percent due primarily to the acquisition of novars ibs business and growth in security and energy retrofits partially offset by the divestiture of our security monitoring business in the prior year sales for our process solutions business increased by 4 percent primarily due to an acquisition and the favorable effect of foreign exchange automation and control solutions sales in 2004 increased by 8 percent compared with 2003 due to higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 4 percent partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent sales increased by 9 percent for our products businesses due principally to strong sales of fire solutions environmental controls and sensor products and the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions sales for our process solutions business increased by 8 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and improvement in industrial production and capital spending sales for our building solutions business increased by 5 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and the impact of investments in sales and marketing initiatives partially offset by the divestiture of our security monitoring business 

  automation and control solutions segment profit in 2005 increased by 19 percent compared with 2004 as the favorable effects of productivity actions acquisitions principally ibs and higher sales volume due in part to new products more than offset the unfavorable effects of lower prices and investments in sales and marketing initiatives automation and control solutions segment profit in 2004 increased by 6 percent compared with 2003 due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes partially offset by increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher research and 

development costs to support new product introductions segment profit was also adversely impacted in 2003 by pricing pressures across all businesses 

  trends which may impact automation and control solutions operating results in 2006 include 

 specialty materials 

   specialty materials sales decreased by 8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 due to divestitures performance fibers industrial wax and north american nylon carpet fiber businesses net of acquisitions uop of 12 percent and lower volumes of 3 percent partially offset by the impact of higher prices of 7 percent primarily in our resins and chemicals previously nylon and fluorocarbons previously chemicals businesses sales for our resins and chemicals business increased by 9 percent driven by price increases sales for our fluorocarbons business improved by 6 percent principally driven by price increases and demand for our nonozone depleting hfc products for refrigeration and air conditioning applications as well as for blowing agents for insulation applications sales for our performance products business decreased by 4 percent primarily driven by lower volumes in our specialty films business specialty materials sales in 2004 increased by 10 percent compared with 2003 due to the impact of higher prices of 6 percent mainly in our resins and chemicals business higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 1 percent partially offset by prior year divestitures net of acquisitions of 2 percent sales for our fluorocarbons business improved by 19 percent driven principally by continuing strong demand for our nonozone depleting hfc products for refrigeration and air conditioning applications as well as for blowing agents for insulation applications sales for our electronic materials business increased by 13 percent driven by improvement in the semiconductor industry sales for our performance products business were also higher by 13 percent due to strong demand for our spectra fiber principally from the us military 

  specialty materials segment profit in 2005 increased by 40 percent compared with 2004 due principally to price increases and the favorable effect of productivity actions partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes specialty materials segment profit in 2004 increased by 35 percent compared with 2003 due principally to higher sales volumes and price increases partially offset by higher raw material costs mainly in our resins and chemicals business additionally segment profit in 2003 was adversely impacted by temporary plant shutdowns in our fluorocarbons and resins and chemicals businesses

repositioning and other charges 

  a summary of repositioning and other charges follows 

   the following table summarizes the pretax distribution of total net repositioning and other charges by income statement classification 

   in 2005 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 267 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 5269 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments including the implementation of a new organizational structure in our aerospace reportable segment which reorganized our aerospace businesses to better align with customer segments the implementation of the new aerospace organizational structure was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2005 also 25 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance at our corporate specialty materials and automation and control solutions reportable segments were returned to income in 2005 the reversal of severance liabilities relates to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs excise taxes relating to executive severance amounts previously paid which were determined to no longer be payable and severance amounts previously paid to an outside service provider as part of an outsourcing arrangement which were refunded to honeywell 

  in 2004 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 116 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 2272 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments also 28 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance were returned to income in 2004 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions resulting in reduced severance liabilities principally in our automation and control solutions reportable segment 

  in 2003 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 82 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 1501 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments also 69 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance were returned to income in 2003 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions resulting in reduced severance liabilities in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials reportable segments 

  our 2005 repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 170 million in 2006 compared with 2005 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 171 164 and 200 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate 125 million in 2006 and will be funded principally through operating cash flows

cash flow summary 

  our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

   cash provided by operating activities increased by 189 million during 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to increased cash earnings and improvements in working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable of 270 million partially offset by an increase in asbestos liability payments net of insurance receipts of 139 million cash provided by operating activities increased by 54 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to increased cash earnings and a decrease in voluntary 

us pension contributions of 630 million the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in asbestos liability payments net of insurance receipts of 558 million as the prior year included 472 million in cash received in connection with a settlement with an insurance carrier and an increase in working capital usage of 268 million principally related to higher sales and a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and canadian dollar throughout 2004 

  cash used for investing activities increased by 1426 million during 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to an increase in spending for acquisitions of 2295 million primarily novar uop and zellweger partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of businesses of 571 million largely from the sale of the security printing business and an increase in proceeds of 320 million from maturities of investment securities cash used for investing activities decreased by 96 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in proceeds from sales of businesses of 289 million largely from the dispositions of our security monitoring and vcsel optical products businesses in 2004 additionally proceeds from the maturity of investment securities were 80 million in 2004 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by an increase in spending for acquisitions of 185 million due principally to various acquisitions in our automation and control solutions reportable segment and an investment of 115 million in auction rate securities 

  cash used for financing activities increased by 1493 million during 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to an increase in debt repayments of 1120 million related to an increase in scheduled maturities of longterm debt of 953 million and a repayment of debt of 702 million assumed in the novar acquisition partially offset by an increase in shortterm and commercial paper borrowings of 535 million related principally to the uop acquisition and share repurchases the increase in cash used for financing activities was also driven by an increase in repurchases of common stock of 409 million and higher dividend payments of 57 million partially offset by increased proceeds from issuances of common stock of 93 million total debt of 5106 million at december 31 2005 was 167 million or 3 percent lower than at december 31 2004 mainly due to lower longterm debt due to scheduled maturities in 2005 partially offset by higher shortterm borrowings mainly due to acquisitions and share repurchases cash used for financing activities increased by 328 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in repurchases of common stock of 687 million in connection with our stock repurchase program partially offset by a reduction in debt repayments net of issuances of 337 million in 2004 total debt of 5273 million at december 31 2004 was 113 million or 2 percent higher than at december 31 2003 principally reflecting higher commercial paper borrowings to fund our share repurchases in 2004 

liquidity 

  we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity operating cash flows were 24 billion in 2005 we have approximately 12 billion in cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2005 down from 36 billion at december 31 2004 due primarily to acquisitions and share repurchases working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable was 55 billion at december 31 2005 each of our businesses are focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2006 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

  a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 270 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 754 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2005 

  our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and our 25 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities revolving credit facilities our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major 

independent debtrating agencies in 2004 standard and poors and fitchs rating services affirmed their corporate ratings on our longterm debt a and a respectively and shortterm debt a1 and f1 respectively and maintained honeywells ratings outlook as “stable” in 2005 moodys investors service affirmed its corporate rating on our longterm and shortterm debt of a2 and p1 respectively and revised honeywells ratings outlook to “stable” from “negative” 

  revolving credit facilities of 23 billion are maintained with a group of banks arranged by citigroup global markets inc and jp morgan securities inc which is comprised of a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and b a 13 billion fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreements are maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper the 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement includes a 200 million sublimit for the potential issuance of letters of credit the 13 billion fiveyear credit agreement includes a 300 million sublimit for the potential issuance of letters of credit a new 364day 240 million canadian dollar facility 206 million in us dollars was established in 2005 the new facility was arranged by citibank na canadian branch for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper in canada see note 15 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  we also have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to issue up to 3 billion in debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

  we also sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables were overcollateralized by 178 million at december 31 2005 and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools new receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are collected the retained interests in the receivables are reflected at the amounts expected to be collected by us and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests the sold receivables were 500 million at both december 31 2005 and 2004 

  in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments dividends employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions 

  specifically we expect our primary cash requirements in 2006 to be as follows 

 38

   we have made an allcash offer for the entire issued ordinary share capital of first technology plc a provider of gas sensing and detection products and services headquartered in the uk the aggregate value of the offer is approximately 718 million fully diluted for the exercise of all outstanding options and including the assumption of approximately 199 million of outstanding debt we expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2006 subject to regulatory approval 

  we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify businesses that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these businesses are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2005 we realized 997 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

  based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations debt maturities and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

  following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2005 

 

 footnotes continued on next page 

footnotes continued from previous page 

   the table excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations we made voluntary contributions of 40 and 670 million to our us pension plans in 2004 and 2003 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2006 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future we expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately 45 million to our us plans in 2006 we expect to make contributions to our nonus plans of approximately 150 million in 2006 payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 186 million in 2006 including the benefit of approximately 19 million from the medicare prescription subsidy see note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

  guarantees— we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2005 

   we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

  retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables— as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2005 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible at december 31 2005 our retained subordinated and undivided interests at risk were 178 and 573 million respectively based on the underlying credit quality of the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold we do not expect 

that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

  with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonable possible environmental loss in excess of our accrual we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were 247 248 and 77 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 250 million in 2006 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 186 536 and 235 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively at december 31 2005 and 2004 the recorded liability for environmental matters was 879 and 895 million respectively in addition in 2005 and 2004 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 87 and 75 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

  although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

  see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

  as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged 

derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to have all transaction exposures hedged with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the euro the canadian dollar british pound and the us dollar 

  our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as described in notes 15 and 17 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

  financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

  the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

    the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming 

certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

other matters 

litigation 

  see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters 

sales to the us government 

  sales to the us government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3719 3464 and 3111 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this included sales to the us department of defense dod as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2939 2808 and 2564 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to the dod accounted for 106 110 and 111 percent of our total sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively us defense spending increased in 2005 and is also expected to increase in 2006 

backlog 

  our total backlog at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 9327 and 8229 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 7594 million of the 2005 backlog will be filled in 2006 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option 

inflation 

  highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and the costs of our purchased materials except for the costs of certain raw materials in our specialty materials and transportation systems reportable segments see review of business segments section of this mda for further discussion cost increases for materials and labor have generally been low and productivity enhancement programs including repositioning actions and six sigma initiatives have largely offset any impact

 aerospace sales 

  our sales to aerospace customers were 38 38 and 40 percent of our total sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 8 7 and 9 percent of our total sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively if there are large changes in sales of aircraft that use our components operating results could be impacted in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 16 15 and 16 percent of our total sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively if there are large changes in the number of global flying hours or landings for aircraft that use our components or services operating results could be impacted the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 resulted in an abrupt downturn in the aviation industry which was already negatively impacted by a weak economy this dramatic downturn in the commercial air transport industry significantly impacted the operating results of our aerospace segment in 2002 and 2003 we began to see some recovery at the end of 2003 which continued in 2004 aided by continued improvement in the commercial aerospace market segment and the favorable impact of safety mandates 

us government sales 

  sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3464 3111 and 2730 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2808 2564 and 2046 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively us defense spending increased in 2004 and is also expected to increase in 2005 

  in addition to normal business risks companies engaged in supplying military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 

  our contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many other government contractors we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases in addition we accrue for liabilities associated with these government contract matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated 

  us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages suffered by the government 

  we like other government contractors are subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violation of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other egregious misconduct debarment generally does not exceed three years although the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with certainty we are not aware of any investigations that we expect will have a material adverse effect on us

  our total backlog at yearend 2004 and 2003 was 8229 and 7191 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 6339 million of the 2004 backlog will be filled in 2005 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option 

competition 

  we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable price competition other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers 

international operations 

  we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations us exports comprised 9 and 10 percent of our total net sales in 2004 and 2003 respectively foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 35 and 34 percent of our total net sales in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  our international operations including us exports are potentially subject to a number of unique risks and limitations including fluctuations in currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions including embargoes and governmental instability 

  approximately 18 percent of total 2004 net sales of aerospacerelated products and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft 

repair and overhaul exports were principally made to europe asia and canada foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised 14 percent of total 2004 aerospace net sales 

  approximately 3 percent of total 2004 net sales of automation and control solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 49 percent of total 2004 net sales of automation and control solutions the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe and mexico with less significant operations in asia and canada 

  approximately 11 percent of total 2004 net sales of specialty materials were exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia europe latin america and canada foreign manufactured products comprised 29 percent of total 2004 net sales of specialty materials the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and canada 

  exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2004 net sales of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for 62 percent of total 2004 net sales of transportation systems the principal manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia latin america and canada 

raw materials 

  the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2004 we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials however we are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future the costs of certain key raw materials including natural gas and benzene in our specialty materials business were at historically high levels in 2004 and are expected to remain at those levels in 2005 we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with price increases where feasible at present we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2005 

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights 

  our business as a whole and that of our strategic business units are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business 

  we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram anso autolite bendix jurid and garrett 

research and development 

  our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes and the development of new uses for existing products 

  research and development expense totaled 917 751 and 757 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in research and development expense in 2004 compared with 2003 results primarily from design and developments costs associated with new aircraft platforms in aerospace and new product development costs in automation and control solutions customersponsored principally the us government research and development activities amounted to an additional 593 608 and 603 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

environment 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

  we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

  among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multiparty situations taken as a whole 

  in the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v honeywell international inc et al the united states district court for the district of new jersey held in may 2003 that a predecessor honeywell site located in jersey city new jersey constituted an imminent and substantial endangerment and ordered honeywell to conduct the excavation and transport for offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at the site honeywell appealed the courts decision to the third circuit court of appeals appeals court as disclosed in prior sec filings we believed that the district courtordered remedy would be remanded reversed or replaced and accordingly provisions previously made in our financial statements for remedial costs at this site did not assume excavation and offsite removal of chromium on february 18 2005 the appeals court denied honeywells appeal in light of the appeals court decision we recorded a pretax charge of 278 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 which reflects the incremental cost of implementing the courtordered remedy implementation of the excavation and offsite removal remedy is expected to take place over a fiveyear period and the cost of implementation is expected to be incurred evenly over that period we do not expect implementation of the remedy to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations operating cash flows or financial position 

  in accordance with a 1992 consent decree with the state of new york honeywell is studying environmental conditions in and around onondaga lake the lake in syracuse new york the purpose of the study is to identify evaluate and propose remedial measures that can be taken to remedy historic industrial contamination in the lake a predecessor company to honeywell operated a chemical plant which is alleged to have contributed mercury and other contaminants to the lake in november 2004 the new york state department of environmental conservation the dec issued its proposed plan for remediation of industrial contamination in the lake there will be a public comment period until march 1 2005 and the proposed plan is subject to review by the us environmental protection agency the dec is currently expected to issue its record of decision in the first half of 2005 

  the proposed plan calls for a combined dredgingcapping remedy generally in line with the approach recommended in the feasibility study submitted by honeywell in may 2004 the may 2004 feasibility study although the proposed plan calls for additional remediation in certain parts of the lake it would not require the most extensive dredging alternatives described in the may 2004 feasibility study the decs aggregate cost estimate is based on the high end of the range of potential costs for major elements of the proposed plan and includes a contingency the actual cost of the 

proposed plan will depend upon among other things the resolution of certain technical issues during the design phase of the remediation expected to occur sometime in 2007 and beyond 

  based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants our estimated cost of implementing the remedy set forth in the proposed plan is consistent with amounts previously provided for in our financial statements our estimating process considered a range of possible outcomes and amounts recorded reflect our best estimate at this time we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position given the scope and complexity of this project it is possible that actual costs could exceed estimated costs by an amount that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid at this time however we cannot identify any legal regulatory or technical reason to conclude that a specific alternative outcome is more probable than the outcome for which we have made provisions in our financial statements

 critical accounting policies 

  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

  we have discussed the selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accountants there were no new accounting standards effective in 2004 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  contingent liabilities— we are subject to a number of lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities these contingencies relate to product liabilities including asbestos commercial transactions government contracts and environmental health and safety matters we recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters the outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future where estimable asbestos claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our settlement strategy for a discussion of our contingencies related to shareowners litigation environmental and asbestos matters including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities see notes 1 and 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  insurance for asbestos related liabilities— in connection with recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgments concerning insurance coverage 

that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs we have approximately 13 billion in insurance coverage remaining that can be specifically allocated to north american refractories company narco related asbestos liabilities we also have 19 billion in coverage remaining for bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies a comprehensive policy buyback settlement with equitas and certain uninsured periods resulting in approximately 50 percent of these claims being reimbursable by insurance our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities 

  defined benefit pension plans— we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets we consider current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic plan asset returns over varying longterm periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations see note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for actual and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longterm assumption and generally does not change annually the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on our annual measurement date december 31 and is subject to change each year the expected rate of return on pension assets and discount rate were determined in accordance with consistent methodologies as described in note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  the key assumptions used in developing our 2004 2003 and 2002 net periodic pension expense income for our us plans included the following 

   the reduction in the discount rate in both 2004 and 2003 reflects the lower market interest rate environment for highquality fixed income debt instruments the discount rate is also volatile because it is determined based upon the prevailing rate as of the measurement date due to continuing declines in interest rates we will use a 5875 percent discount rate in 2005 the expected rate of return on plan assets was reduced from 10 to 9 percent for 2003 to reflect the impact of the poor performance of the equity markets during the three year period ended december 31 2002 as equity markets have stabilized in 2003 and 2004 we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return of 9 percent for 2005 the unrecognized net losses for our us pension plans were 26 billion at december 31 2004 down from 32 billion at december 31 2003 these unrecognized losses mainly result from actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return during 2002 2001 and 2000 and from lower discount rates and are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” sfas 

no 87 under sfas no 87 we use the marketrelated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a threeyear period further unrecognized losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over a sixyear period net periodic pension expense for our us pension plans is expected to be 320 million in 2005 a 56 million decrease from 2004 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of unrecognized losses the decline in the amortization of unrecognized losses results principally from actual plan asset returns higher than the expected rate of return in 2003 and 2004 

  we made voluntary contributions of 40 670 and 830 million to our us pension plans in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 2003 and 2002 voluntary contributions were made to improve the funded status of the plans which had been impacted by the poor performance of the equity markets during the threeyear period ended december 31 2002 as well as the declining interest rate environment future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2005 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans for the foreseeable future 

  changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of our us pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

   sfas no 87 requires recognition of an additional minimum pension liability if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at the end of the plan year in 2004 we recorded a noncash adjustment to equity through accumulated other nonowner changes of 15 million 19 million on a pretax basis which increased the additional minimum pension liability in 2003 we recorded a noncash adjustment to equity through accumulated other nonowner changes of 369 million 604 million on a pretax basis to reduce the additional minimum pension liability by 304 million and reinstate a portion of our pension assets 300 million written off as a result of the prior years minimum pension liability adjustment the 2003 adjustment resulted from an increase in our pension assets in 2003 due to the improvement in equity markets and our contribution of 670 million to our us plans in 2002 due to the poor performance of the equity markets which adversely affected our pension assets and a decline in the discount rate we recorded a noncash adjustment to equity through accumulated other nonowner changes of 606 million 956 million on a pretax basis which increased the additional minimum pension liability equity market returns and interest rates significantly impact the funded status of our pension plans based on future plan asset performance and interest rates additional adjustments to equity may be required 

  longlived assets including tangible and definitelived intangible assets— to conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy we acquire tangible and intangible assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets including property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset group may not be fully recoverable these events or changes in circumstances include business plans and forecasts economic or competitive positions within an industry as well as current operating performance and anticipated future performance based on a business competitive position an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a longlived asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings we continually apply our best judgment 

when applying the impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairment and the fair value of an impaired longlived asset group the dynamic economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows such as economic growth rates industry growth rates product life cycles selling price changes and cost inflation can significantly influence and impact the outcome of all impairment tests for a discussion of the result of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of impairment charges see the repositioning and other charges section of this mda 

  income taxes— the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 17 and 18 billion at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in particular any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets additionally valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws and future taxable income levels in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made conversely if we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made 

  sales recognition on longterm contracts— in 2004 we recognized approximately 8 percent of our total net sales using the percentageofcompletion method for longterm contracts in our automation and control solutions and aerospace reportable segments the percentageofcompletion method requires us to make judgments in estimating contract revenues contract costs and progress toward completion these judgments form the basis for our determinations regarding overall contract value contract profitability and timing of revenue recognition based on measured progress toward contract completion revenue and cost estimates are monitored on an ongoing basis and revised based on changes in circumstances anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recognized when such losses become evident we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification contract pricing and cost estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses 

  aerospace customer incentives— consistent with other suppliers to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines we provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units for installation on commercial aircraft these incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products product credits and upfront cash payments the cost of these incentives are capitalized at the time we deliver the products to our customers or in the case of product credits at the time the credit is issued or in the case of upfront cash payments at the time the payment is made in the case of free or deeply discounted product the cost to manufacture less any amount recovered from the airframe manufacturer or airline is capitalized product credits and upfront cash payments are capitalized at exchanged value research design development and qualification costs related to these products are expensed as incurred unless contractually guaranteed of reimbursement the cost of the sales incentives described above is capitalized because the selection of our aircraft wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units for installation on commercial aircraft results in the creation of future revenues and cash flows through aftermarket sales to fulfill longterm product maintenance requirements mandated by the federal aviation administration faa and other similar international organizations over the useful life of the aircraft once our products are certified and selected on an aircraft the recovery of our investment is virtually guaranteed over the useful life of the aircraft the likelihood of displacement by an alternative supplier is remote due to contractual solesourcing the high cost to alternative suppliers and aircraft operators of product retrofits andor rigorous regulatory 

specifications qualification and testing requirements amounts capitalized at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were 776 719 and 662 million respectively and are being amortized over their useful lives on a straightline basis up to 25 years representing the estimated minimum service life of the aircraft this useful life is the period over which we are virtually assured to earn revenues from the aftermarket sales of certified products necessary to fulfill the maintenance required by the faa and other similar international organizations we classify the amortization expense associated with free and discounted products as cost of goods sold and the amortization expense associated with product credits and upfront cash payments as a reduction of sales we regularly evaluate the recoverablitity of capitalized amounts whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the incentives may not be fully recoverable there were no impairment charges related to these capitalized incentives recognized during 2004 2003 and 2002 for additional information see note 13 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

results of operations 

net sales 

   the change in net sales in 2004 and 2003 is attributable to the following 

   a discussion of net sales by reportable segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this mda 

cost of products and services sold 

   gross margin decreased in 2004 by 15 percentage points compared with 2003 the decrease resulted primarily from an increase in net repositioning and other charges of 349 million higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 249 million and an increase in research and development expense of 166 million partially offset by an increase in sales of highermargin products and services mainly in our aerospace reportable segment gross margin increased in 2003 by 02 percentage points compared with 2002 the increase resulted primarily from a decrease in net repositioning and other charges of 289 million partially offset by higher pension expense and a decrease in sales of highermargin products and services mainly in our aerospace and automation and control solutions reportable segments 

selling general and administrative expenses 

   selling general and administrative expenses increased by 366 million or 12 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due to an increase in general and administrative expenses of 155 million due in part to higher spending for information technology systems an increase in selling expenses of 136 million from higher sales and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 54 million selling general and administrative expenses increased by 193 million or 7 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to an increase in general and administrative expenses of 120 million due in part to an increase in other employee benefit expenses and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 56 million 

   pension expense increased by 276 and 290 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively mainly due to the following 

   using an expected longterm rate of return of 9 percent and a discount rate of 5875 percent pension expense for our us plans is expected to be 320 million in 2005 a decrease of 56 million compared with 2004 

gain loss on sale of nonstrategic businesses 

   gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 255 million in 2004 represents the pretax gains on the sales of our security monitoring and vcsel optical products businesses in our automation and control solutions reportable segment of 215 and 36 million respectively the gain also includes adjustments of 19 million related to businesses sold in prior periods and the pretax loss of 15 million on the sale of our performance fibers business in our specialty materials reportable segment the dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2004 compared with 2003 gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 38 million in 2003 represents the net pretax gain on the dispositions of certain specialty materials engineering plastics rudolstadt and metglas and aerospace honeywell aerospace defense services businesses the dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2003 compared with 2002 

asbestos related litigation charges net of insurance 

   in 2004 we recognized charges totaling 76 million primarily for bendix related asbestos claims filed and defense costs incurred during 2004 net of insurance recoveries the charges include an update of expected resolution values for pending bendix claims and are net of an additional 47 million of narco insurance deemed probable of recovery in 2002 asbestos related litigation charges net of insurance related to costs associated with asbestos claims related to narco see asbestos matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion 

business impairment charges 

   business impairment charges in 2004 relates principally to the writedown of property plant and equipment of our performance fibers business in our specialty materials reportable segment the performance fibers business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 business impairment charges in 2002 related to the writedown of property plant and equipment of businesses in our specialty materials and automation and control solutions reportable segments and of our friction materials business see the repositioning and other charges section of this mda for further details 

equity in income loss of affiliated companies 

   equity income increased by 44 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an improvement in earnings from our uop process technology joint venture uop equity income decreased by 4 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due to a charge of 2 million in 2003 related to the sale of a specialty materials equity investees investment also 2002 included income of 15 million resulting from exiting joint ventures in our aerospace and transportation systems reportable segments partially offset by a charge of 13 million for severance actions by uop 

other income expense 

   other income increased by 111 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due principally to a decrease in foreign exchange losses of 93 million in the current year due to a reduction in foreign exchange exposures resulting in losses in 2003 due to a weak us dollar a gain of 27 million related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and an increase in interest income of 13 million from higher cash balances partially offset by the inclusion of a gain of 20 million in the prior year related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit other expense increased by 23 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due principally to an increase of 65 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from weakness in the us dollar mainly against the euro partially offset by a gain of 20 million related to a settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and an increase of 19 million in interest income from higher cash balances 

interest and other financial charges 

   interest and other financial charges decreased by 1 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due principally to lower average shortterm debt outstanding in the current year interest and other financial charges decreased by 3 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due principally to lower average interest rates 

tax expense benefit 

   the effective tax benefit rate in 2004 2003 and 2002 was different than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits from export sales favorable tax audit settlements and foreign tax planning strategies the effective tax rate in 2003 also includes tax benefits expected to be realized as a result of the redesignation of our friction materials business from held for sale to held and used resulting from the termination of discussions with federalmogul corp the effective benefit rate in 2002 included the tax benefit resulting from a higher deductible tax basis than book basis related to sales of our advanced circuits pfc and consumer products businesses the impact of tax benefits from export sales us tax credits and favorable audit settlements had a more favorable impact on our effective benefit rate in 2002 principally due to the relative amount of these benefits in comparison to the amount of our pretax loss in 2002 see note 7 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further information on taxes including a detailed effective tax rate reconciliation 

  the american jobs creation act of 2004 signed into law in october 2004 provides for a variety of changes in the tax law including incentives to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries a phased elimination of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a domestic manufacturing benefit more specifically the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and currently uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act as such we are not in a position to determine whether and to what extent we might repatriate foreign earnings based on our analysis to date however it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate some amount up to approximately 26 billion we estimate the income tax effects of repatriating 26 billion to be approximately 150 to 350 million honeywell has not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on 39 billion of undistributed earnings from nonus operations as of december 31 2004 until our analysis of the act is completed we will continue to permanently reinvest those earnings we expect to finalize our assessment later in 2005 

  the extraterritorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales will be phasedout over two years beginning in 2005 the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities will be phasedin from 2005 through 2010 similar to the eti benefit the domestic manufacturing benefit has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date rather the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our federal income tax return we are currently assessing the details of the act and the net effect of the phaseout of the eti and the phasein of this new deduction we expect to complete our analysis later in 2005 until such time it is not possible to determine what impact this legislation will have on our consolidated tax accruals or effective tax rate 

net income loss 

   the decrease of 005 per share in 2004 compared with 2003 relates primarily to increased charges for environmental matters primarily attributable to the denial of our appeal in the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v honeywell international inc et al  see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense partially offset by an increase in segment profit across all reportable segments the increase of 181 per share in 2003 compared with 2002 mainly relates to a decrease in repositioning and other charges partially offset by the impact of higher pension expense and lower sales of highermargin products and services principally in our aerospace and automation and control solutions reportable segments

 aerospace 

   aerospace sales by major customer endmarkets were as follows 

   details of the changes in sales for both 2004 and 2003 by customer endmarkets were as follows 

 27

   aerospace segment profit in 2004 increased by 21 percent compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in sales of higher margin commercial aftermarket products and services and volume growth this increase was partially offset by higher development expense associated with new programs and an increase in spending for information technology systems aerospace segment profit in 2003 decreased by 7 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to lower sales of commercial original equipment and highermargin commercial aftermarket spare parts 

  trends which may impact aerospace operating results in 2005 include 

 automation and control solutions 

   automation and control solutions sales in 2004 increased by 8 percent compared with 2003 due to higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 4 percent partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent sales increased by 9 percent for our automation and control products businesses due principally to strong sales of fire solutions environmental controls and sensor products and the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions sales for our process solutions business increased by 8 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and improvement in industrial production and capital spending sales for our building solutions business increased by 5 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and the impact of investments in sales and marketing initiatives partially offset by the divestiture of our security 

monitoring business automation and control solutions sales in 2003 increased by 7 percent compared with 2002 due to favorable effects of foreign exchange of 5 percent and acquisitions net of the disposition of our consumer products business of 4 percent partially offset by the impact of lower prices and volumes of 1 percent each sales increased by 11 percent for our automation and control products businesses as the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions mainly invensys sensor systems invensys more than offset the impact of the disposition of our consumer products business and lower volumes sales for our process solutions business increased by 4 percent due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange partially offset by lower unit volumes sales for our building solutions business increased by 2 percent as the favorable effect of foreign exchange more than offset lower volumes due to continued softness in the nonresidential construction market 

  automation and control solutions segment profit in 2004 increased by 6 percent compared with 2003 due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes partially offset by increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher research and development costs to support new product introductions automation and control solutions segment profit in 2003 decreased by 2 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to the decline in highermargin energyretrofit and discretionary spot sales in our building solutions business and increased research and development expense and investments in sales and marketing initiatives mainly in our automation and control products and building solutions businesses respectively segment profit was also adversely impacted in 2003 by pricing pressures mainly in our automation and control products and process solutions businesses 

  trends which may impact automation and control solutions operating results in 2005 include 

 specialty materials 

   specialty materials sales in 2004 increased by 10 percent compared with 2003 due to the impact of higher prices of 6 percent mainly in our nylon system business higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 1 percent partially offset by prior year divestitures net of acquisitions of 2 percent sales for our chemicals business improved by 19 percent driven principally by continuing strong demand for our nonozone depleting hfc products for refrigeration and air conditioning applications as well as for blowing agents for insulation applications sales for our electronic materials business increased by 13 percent driven by improvement in the semiconductor industry sales for our performance products business were also higher by 13 percent due to strong demand for our spectra fiber principally from the us military specialty materials sales in 2003 decreased by 1 percent compared with 2002 due to the impact of the divestitures of our advanced circuits pfc and engineering plastics businesses net of the acquisition of basfs nylon fiber business of 6 percent partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange of 3 percent and higher volumes of 2 percent higher volumes were principally driven by strong demand for spectra fiber from the us military increasing demand for hfcs a key component of many nonozone depleting refrigerants and foam blowing agents and increased demand for electronic materials from the semiconductor industry volumes were adversely affected in 2003 by the temporary plant shutdowns in our fluorocarbons and nylon system businesses 

  specialty materials segment profit in 2004 increased by 35 percent compared with 2003 due principally to higher sales volumes and price increases partially offset by higher raw material costs principally phenol resulting from increases in benzene prices mainly in our nylon system business 

additionally segment profit in 2003 was adversely impacted by temporary plant shutdowns in our fluorocarbons and nylon system businesses specialty materials segment profit in 2003 increased by 51 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to the impact of the prior year writedown of property plant and equipment in several businesses the benefits of cost actions including synergies from the nylon transaction divestitures of nonstrategic businesses and higher sales volumes the increase was partially offset by higher raw material costs mainly natural gas and phenol resulting from increases in benzene prices and the impact of the temporary plant shutdowns in our fluorocarbons and nylon system businesses 

  trends which may impact specialty materials operating results in 2005 include 

 transportation systems 

   transportation systems sales in 2004 increased by 18 percent compared with 2003 due primarily to a favorable sales mix and higher volumes of 12 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 6 percent the increase in sales for the segment resulted principally from a 29 percent increase in sales in our honeywell turbo technologies business due to a favorable sales mix and volume growth driven by increasing diesel penetration in europe and strength in the north american truck segment and the favorable effect of foreign exchange sales for our consumer products group business increased by 7 percent driven by strong retail demand for our highend products and recent introductions of new autolite fram and prestone products and the favorable effect of foreign exchange and higher prices offsetting incremental ethylene glycol raw material costs sales for our friction materials business increased by 7 percent largely due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange transportation systems sales in 2003 increased by 15 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to the favorable effects of foreign exchange of 9 percent and a favorable sales mix and volume growth of 5 percent the increase resulted mainly from a 27 percent increase in sales in our honeywell turbo technologies business due to a favorable sales mix and volume growth of 15 percent as worldwide demand for our turbochargers continued to be strong and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 12 percent 

  transportation systems segment profit in 2004 increased by 25 percent compared with 2003 due primarily to the effect of favorable sales mix and volume growth in our honeywell turbo technologies business partially offset by higher raw material costs mostly steel and other metals in each of the segments businesses and ethylene glycol in our consumer products group business transportation systems segment profit in 2003 increased by 17 percent compared with 2002 as the effect of higher sales in our honeywell turbo technologies business was partially offset by higher new product development and introduction and facility relocations expenses and lower aftermarket sales at our friction materials business

 repositioning and other charges 

  a summary of repositioning and other charges follows 

   the following table summarizes the pretax distribution of total net repositioning and other charges by income statement classification 

   in 2004 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 116 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 2272 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments also 28 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance were returned to income in 2004 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions resulting in reduced severance liabilities principally in our automation and control solutions reportable segment 

  in 2003 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 82 million primarly for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 1501 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments also 69 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance were returned to income in 2003 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions resulting in reduced severance liabilities in our automation and control solutions aerospace and specialty materials reportable segments 

  in 2002 we recognized repositioning charges totaling 453 million for workforce reductions across all of our reportable segments and our uop process technology joint venture the charge also related to costs for the planned shutdown and consolidation of manufacturing plants in our specialty materials and automation and control solutions reportable segments severance costs related to announced workforce reductions of approximately 8100 manufacturing and administrative positions asset impairments principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of impairment exit costs related principally to incremental costs to exit facilities including lease termination losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation related mainly to closed facilities in our automation and control solutions and specialty materials reportable segments also 76 million of previously established severance accruals were returned to income in 2002 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions and higher than expected voluntary employee attrition resulting in reduced severance liabilities in our aerospace automation and control solutions and specialty materials reportable segments 

  our 2004 repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately 75 million in 2005 compared with 2004 principally from planned workforce reductions cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were 164 200 and 447 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate 100 million in 2005 and will be funded principally through operating cash flows 

  in 2004 we recognized a charge of 565 million for other probable and reasonably estimable legal and environmental liabilities this includes 536 million for legacy environmental liabilities primarily related to the denial of our appeal of the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v honeywell international inc et al and estimated liabilities for remediation of environmental conditions in and around onondaga lake in syracuse new york both of these environmental matters are discussed in further detail in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” we recognized a charge of 29 million for various legal settlements including property damage claims in our automation and control solutions reportable segment we recognized a charge of 76 million primarily for bendix related asbestos claims and defense costs incurred in 2004 including an update of expected resolution values with respect to pending claims the charge was net of probable bendix related insurance recoveries and an additional 47 million of narco insurance deemed probable of recovery see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion we recognized an impairment charge of 42 million in the second quarter of 2004 related principally to the writedown of property plant and equipment of our performance fibers business in our specialty materials reportable segment this business was sold in december 2004 we recognized a charge of 14 million for the writeoff of receivables inventories and other assets we also reversed a reserve of 10 million established in the prior year for a contract settlement 

  in 2003 we recognized a charge of 261 million for other probable and reasonably estimable legal and environmental liabilities this included 235 million for environmental liabilities mainly related to the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v honeywell international inc et al and for remediation of environmental conditions in and around onondaga lake in syracuse new york both as discussed in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” we also recognized a charge of 4 million in our specialty materials reportable segment including a loss on sale of an investment owned by an equity investee 

  in 2002 we recognized business impairment charges of 877 million related to businesses in our specialty materials and automation and control solutions reportable segments as well as our friction materials business based on current operating losses and deteriorating economic conditions in certain chemical and telecommunications endmarkets we performed impairment tests and recognized impairment charges of 785 million principally related to the writedown of property plant and equipment held and used in our nylon system performance fibers and metglas specialty materials businesses as well as an automation and control solutions communication business we also 

recognized impairment charges of 92 million related principally to the writedown of property plant and equipment of our friction materials business which was classified as assets held for disposal in other current assets as of december 31 2002 a plan of disposal of friction materials was adopted in 2001 in january 2003 we entered into a letter of intent to sell this business to federalmogul corp the assets were reclassified from held for sale to held and used as of december 31 2003 following the cessation of negotiations to sell our friction materials business to federalmogul corp at that time no adjustment to the carrying value of friction materials assets was required based on a current reassessment of the fair value of those assets such reassessment of the fair value of the property plant and equipment was performed using discounted estimated future cash flows of the business the fair value approximated the writtendown held for sale value and was also less than the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment prior to being classified as held for sale adjusted for depreciation expense that would have otherwise been recognized had these assets been classified as held and used see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion we recognized asbestos related litigation charges of 1548 million principally related to costs associated with the potential resolution of asbestos claims of narco see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion we also recognized other charges consisting of customer claims and settlements of contract liabilities of 152 million and writeoffs of receivables inventories and other assets of 60 million these other charges related mainly to our advanced circuits business bankruptcy of a customer in our aerospace reportable segment and customer claims in our aerospace and automation and control solutions reportable segments additionally we recognized other charges consisting of other probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities of 30 million and writeoffs related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain equity investments of 15 million

cash flow summary 

  our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized as follows 

   cash provided by operating activities increased by 54 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to increased cash earnings and a decrease in voluntary us pension contributions of 

630 million the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in net asbestos related liability payments of 558 million as the prior year included 472 million in cash received from equitas related to a comprehensive policy buyback settlement and an increase in working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable usage of 268 million principally related to higher sales and a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and canadian dollar throughout 2004 cash provided by operating activities decreased by 181 million during 2003 compared with 2002 mainly due to a 540 million increase in voluntary us pension contributions as well as an increase in working capital usage due primarily to a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and canadian dollar throughout 2003 the decrease was partially offset by reduced severance and exit costs payments of 247 million lower litigation payments of 222 million as well as insurance receipts in excess of asbestos liability payments of 107 million during 2003 

  cash used for investing activities decreased by 96 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in proceeds from sales of businesses of 289 million largely from the dispositions of our security monitoring and vcsel optical products businesses in the current year additionally proceeds from the maturity of investment securities were 80 million in 2004 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by an increase in spending for acquisitions of 185 million due principally to various acquisitions in our automation and control solutions reportable segment and an investment of 115 million in auction rate securities cash used for investing activities decreased by 190 million during 2003 compared with 2002 due mainly to reduced spending of 321 million for acquisitions principally reflecting the acquisition of invensys in october 2002 the decrease was partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales of investments of 91 million related to the disposition of a cost investment in our automation and control solutions reportable segment in 2002 and reduced proceeds from sales of businesses of 46 million proceeds from business sales in 2003 resulted from the sale of certain noncore specialty materials engineering plastics rudolstadt and metglas and aerospace honeywell aerospace defense services businesses 

  cash used for financing activities increased by 328 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in repurchases of common stock of 687 million in connection with our stock repurchase program announced in november 2003 partially offset by a reduction in debt repayments net of issuances of 337 million in 2004 total debt of 5273 million at december 31 2004 was 113 million or 2 percent higher than at december 31 2003 principally reflecting higher commercial paper borrowings to fund our share repurchases in 2004 cash used for financing activities decreased by 37 million during 2003 compared with 2002 mainly due to lower net debt repayments in 2003 partially offset by cash used to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter of 2003 total debt of 5160 million at december 31 2003 was 71 million or 1 percent higher than at december 31 2002 principally reflecting the assumption of 267 million of debt associated with the purchase of assets under operating leases partially offset by lower shortterm borrowings 

  we had approximately 34 and 26 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by nonus subsidiaries mainly in local currencies principally the euro canadian dollar and australian dollar at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the 190 and 305 million increases in cash and cash equivalents in 2004 and 2003 respectively due to exchange rate changes principally resulted from a weakening of the us dollar mainly against the euro and canadian dollar throughout 2004 and 2003 we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available cash balances and the most cost effective method to access those cash balances the repatriation of cash balances from some nonus subsidiaries to the us could have us tax consequences see discussion of american jobs creation act of 2004 in note 7 of notes fo financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” however substantially all cash balances held by nonus subsidiaries are available without legal restrictions to fund business operations 

liquidity 

  we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity operating cash flows were 23 billion in 2004 we have approximately 36 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 48 billion in working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable 

each of our businesses continues to focus on strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2005 to increase operating cash flows considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including our focus on growth cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets using debt and equity securities including commercial paper as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables 

  a source of liquidity is our ability to issue shortterm debt in the commercial paper market our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and our 23 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities revolving credit facilities our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debtrating agencies in 2004 standard and poors and fitch rating services affirmed their corporate ratings on our longterm debt a and a respectively and shortterm debt a1 and f1 respectively and revised honeywells outlook from “negative” to “stable” moodys investors service affirmed its corporate rating on our longterm and shortterm debt of a2 and p1 respectively our credit rating provided by moodys investors service reflects a “negative outlook” due principally to the cyclical market conditions in the commercial air transport industry our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities and the existence of integration risk associated with our recently announced acquisition of novar plc expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005 the “negative outlook” has not impaired nor do we expect it to impair our access to the commercial paper markets 

  commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 270 days from date of issuance borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions there was 220 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2004 

  our 23 billion of revolving credit facilities are maintained with a group of banks arranged by citigroup global markets inc and jp morgan securities inc and comprises a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and b a 13 billion fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreements are maintained for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper the 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement was put in place on october 22 2004 replacing a 1 billion 364day credit agreement which was expiring on november 24 2004 this newly established fiveyear credit facility includes a 200 million sublimit for the potential issuance of letters of credit the 13 billion fiveyear credit agreement was increased in november 2003 with the addition of a 300 million sublimit for the potential issuance of letters of credit see note 15 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  we also have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to issue up to 3 billion in debt securities common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

  we also sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables were overcollateralized by 120 million at december 31 2004 and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools new receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are collected the retained interests in the receivables are reflected at the amounts expected to be collected by us and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests the sold receivables were 500 million at both december 31 2004 and 2003 

  in addition to our normal operating cash requirements our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures debt repayments employee benefit obligations environmental remediation costs asbestos claims severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions our total capital expenditures in 2005 are currently projected at approximately 775 million these expenditures are primarily intended for maintenance 

replacement production capacity expansion cost reduction and growth there are 956 million of longterm debt repayments scheduled for 2005 assuming that actual pension plan returns are consistent with our expected rate of return of 9 percent in 2005 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans for the foreseeable future due to share repurchases made in the fourth quarter of 2004 to offset the anticipated 2005 dilutive impact of employee stockbased compensation plans we do not anticipate the need for additional share repurchases in 2005 under the program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2003 total repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of other investing activities cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining repositioning actions will approximate 100 million in 2005 we expect our cash expenditures for asbestos claims in 2005 to be approximately 744 million and insurance recoveries to be approximately 150 million in 2005 see asbestos matters in note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion as discussed in note 2 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” we expect to complete our acquisition of novar plc in the first quarter of 2005 we expect to fund the acquisition with existing cash resources 

  we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also identify business units that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these business units are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints in 2004 we realized 426 million in cash proceeds from sales of nonstrategic businesses 

  we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs our available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt and equity markets using debt and equity securities including commercial paper as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm liquidity to fund current operations and future investment opportunities based on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing 

contractual obligations and probable liability payments 

  following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31 2004 

 

 37

   the table excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations we made voluntary contributions of 40 670 and 830 million to our us pension plans in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with our expected plan return of 9 percent in 2005 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant we would not be required to make any contributions to our us pension plans for the foreseeable future payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans we expect our opeb payments to approximate 208 million in 2005 see note 22 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of our pension and opeb plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  following is a summary of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

  guarantees— we have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at december 31 2004 

   we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  in connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination if any existing on the date of disposition such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

  retained interests in factored pools of trade accounts receivables— as a source of liquidity we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties the sold receivables 500 million at december 31 2004 are overcollateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that overcollateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools the overcollateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the 

receivables sold becomes uncollectible at december 31 2004 our retained subordinated and undivided interests at risk were 120 and 440 million respectively based on the underlying credit quality of the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold we do not expect that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters including past production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 

  with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we continually conduct studies individually or jointly with other responsible parties to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy see note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws regulations enforcement policies the impact of other potentially responsible parties technology and information related to individual sites we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonable possible environmental loss in excess of our accrual we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were 248 77 and 81 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and are currently estimated to be approximately 267 million in 2005 we expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 

  remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 536 235 and 60 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively at december 31 2004 and 2003 the recorded liability for environmental matters was 895 and 593 million respectively in addition in 2004 and 2003 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 116 and 80 million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations 

  although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

  see note 3 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of our legal and environmental charges and note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation 

financial instruments 

  as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows we attempt to have all transaction exposures hedged with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to the euro the canadian dollar british pound and the us dollar 

  our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as described in notes 15 and 17 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs 

  financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities 

  the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the us dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on 

a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2004 and 2003 

 

   the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events 

other matters 

litigation 

  see note 21 of notes to financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of environmental asbestos and other litigation matters 

sales to the us government 

  sales to the us government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 3464 3111 and 2730 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively this included sales to the department of defense dod as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 2808 2564 and 2046 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sales to the dod accounted for 110 111 and 92 percent of our total sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively us defense spending increased in 2004 and is also expected to increase in 2005 

backlog 

  our total backlog at yearend 2004 and 2003 was 8229 and 7191 million respectively we anticipate that approximately 6339 million of the 2004 backlog will be filled in 2005 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option 

inflation 

  highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and the costs of our purchased materials except for the costs of certain raw materials in our specialty materials reportable segment see business overview section of this mda for further discussion cost increases for materials and labor have generally been low and productivity enhancement programs including repositioning actions and six sigma initiatives have largely offset any impact

aerospace sales

    our sales to aerospace customers were 38 40 and 41 percent of our total
sales in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace
original equipment manufacturers were 7 9 and 12 percent of our total sales in
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively if there were a large decline in sales of
aircraft that use our components operating results could be negatively
impacted in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of
aerospace products and services were 15 16 and 16 percent of our total sales in
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively if there were a large decline in the number
of global flying hours or landings for aircraft that use our components or
services operating results could be negatively impacted the terrorist attacks
on september 11 2001 resulted in an abrupt downturn in the aviation industry
which was already negatively impacted by a weak economy this dramatic downturn
in the commercial air transport industry continued to adversely impact the
operating results of our aerospace segment in 2003

us government sales

    sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting
through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors
amounted to 2595 2277 and 2491 million in 2003 2002 and 2001
respectively which included sales to the us department of defense as a prime
contractor and subcontractor of 2269 1833 and 1631 million in 2003 2002
and 2001 respectively us defense spending increased in 2003 and is also
expected to increase in 2004

    in addition to normal business risks companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual
risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design
improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry
changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly
development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices

                                       7



page

    we like other government contractors are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty we are not currently aware of any such investigations that we expect
individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on us in
addition we have a proactive business compliance program designed to ensure
compliance and sound business practices

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2003 and 2002 was 7191 and 7332 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 5573 million of the 2003
backlog will be filled in 2004 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option

competition

    we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions
competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services
provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular
customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors
such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance
applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity
service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for
our products and services and there is considerable price competition other
competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line
research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while
our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we
are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes
however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with
those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial
financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition
some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original
equipment manufacturers

international operations

    we are engaged in manufacturing sales service and research and development
mainly in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us
exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations
us exports comprised 10 percent of our total net sales in both 2003 and 2002
foreign manufactured products and services mainly in europe were 34 and 30
percent of our total net sales in 2003 and 2002 respectively

    our international operations including us exports are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations including fluctuations in
currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls
employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions
including embargoes and governmental instability however we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate these risks

    approximately 19 percent of total net sales of aerospacerelated products
and services were exports of us manufactured products and systems and
performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul exports were
principally made to europe asia and canada foreign manufactured products and
services comprised 14 percent of total aerospace net sales

    approximately 2 percent of total net sales of automation and control
solutions products were exports of us manufactured products foreign
manufactured products and services accounted for 48 percent of total net sales
of automation and control solutions the principal manufacturing facilities
outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in asia and
canada

    approximately 12 percent of total net sales of specialty materials were
exports of us manufactured products exports were principally made to asia
europe latin america and canada foreign manufactured products comprised 28
percent of total net sales of specialty materials the principal manufacturing
facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant operations in
asia and canada

                                       8

    exports of us manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total net sales
of transportation systems products foreign manufactured products accounted for
62 percent of total net sales of transportation systems the principal
manufacturing facilities outside the us are in europe with less significant
operations in asia latin america and canada

raw materials

    the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2003 we are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials however we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future the costs of certain key raw materials including
natural gas and benzene in our specialty materials business were at
historically high levels in 2003 and are expected to remain at those levels in
2004 based on current volume usage a 10 percent increase in the yearend price
of natural gas and benzene would increase our costs by 12 and 15 million
respectively at present we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw
materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2004

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights

    our business as a whole and that of our strategic business units are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or
distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which
relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are
of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are
obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others
we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate
for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights
under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our
operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of
patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process
or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business

    we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such
consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram anso autolite bendix king and
garrett

research and development

    our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes improvements in existing products and processes and
the development of new uses for existing products

    research and development expense totaled 751 757 and 832 million in
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in research and development
expense in 2002 compared with 2001 related mainly to lower spending by our
aerospace segment due primarily to program completions and fewer new program
launches by original equipment manufacturers customersponsored principally
the us government research and development activities amounted to an
additional 608 603 and 697 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

environment

    we are subject to various federal state and local government requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these
requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with
our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of
our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses

                                       9



page

    we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies we believe that as a general matter our policies practices and
procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal
of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and
regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other
developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies could bring into question our handling manufacture use
or disposal of these substances

    among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal
superfund law and similar state laws under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental
protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court
interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi
party situations taken as a whole

    in the matter entitled interfaith community organization et al v
honeywell international inc et al the united states district court for the
district of new jersey held in may 2003 that a predecessor honeywell site
located in jersey city new jersey constituted an imminent and substantial
endangerment and ordered honeywell to conduct the excavation and transport for
offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present
at the site honeywell strongly disagrees with the courts determinations and
has appealed the courts decision to the third circuit court of appeals per the
appeals courts order the parties are engaged in mediation in october 2003
the district court denied honeywells motion for a stay of certain aspects of
its may 2003 order and we are considering whether to appeal such ruling the
site at issue is one of twentyone sites located in jersey city new jersey
which are the subject of an administrative consent order aco entered into with
the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep in 1993 under the
aco honeywell agreed to study and remediate these sites in accordance with
njdeps directions provided that the total costs of such studies and
remediation do not exceed 60 million honeywell has cooperated with the njdep
under the aco and believes that decisions regarding site cleanups should be made
by the njdep under the aco we are confident that proceeding under the aco will
ensure a safe remediation and allow the property to be placed back into
productive use much faster and at a cost significantly less than the remedies
required by the courts order we have not completed development of a remedial
action plan for the excavation and offsite disposal directed under the courts
order and therefore are unable to estimate the cost of such actions at trial
plaintiffs expert testified that the excavation and offsite disposal cost might
be 400 million however there are significant variables in the implementation
of the courts order and depending on the method of implementation chosen the
estimate could increase or decrease prior to 2003 provisions were made in our
financial statements as to remedial costs consistent with the aco and during the
three months ended june 30 2003 we provided for additional costs which are
likely to be incurred during the pendency of our appeal which provisions do not
assume excavation and offsite removal of chromium from the site there are
alternative outcomes and remedies beyond the scope of the aco that could result
from the remanding reversal or replacement of the courts decision and order
at this time we can neither identify a probable alternative outcome nor
reasonably estimate the cost of an alternative remedy although we expect the
courts decision and order to be remanded reversed or replaced should the
remedies prescribed in the courts decision and order ultimately be upheld such
outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid we do not
expect that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position

    in accordance with a 1992 consent decree with the state of new york
honeywell is studying environmental conditions in and around onondaga lake the
lake in syracuse new york the purpose of the study is to identify evaluate
and propose remedial measures that can be taken to remedy historic industrial
contamination in the lake a predecessor company to honeywell operated a

chemical plant which is alleged to have contributed mercury and other
contaminants to the lake and certain surrounding areas in may 2003 honeywell
submitted to the new york state department of environmental conservation dec a
draft feasibility study for the lake and certain surrounding areas in november
2003 the dec issued formal comments on the feasibility study those comments
include a request for further evaluation of remedies for the lake and
surrounding areas accordingly pursuant to the consent decree honeywell is
required to submit a revised feasibility study on or before may 3 2004
provisions have been made in our financial statements based on our expected
revisions to our feasibility study we do not expect that this matter will have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position however
should the dec ultimately require a substantially more extensive remedy than
that expected to be proposed in the revised feasibility study and should
honeywell agree to undertake such a remedy such outcome could have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and operating cash
flows in the periods recognized or paid

    during 2003 three incidents occurred at our baton rouge louisiana chemical
plant including a release of chlorine a release of antimony pentachloride which
resulted in an employee fatality and an employee exposure to hydrofluoric acid
as a result of these incidents the united states environmental protection
agency usepa occupational health and safety administration osha the
chemical safety board and state and local agencies commenced investigations a
number of potential government claims have been settled including a 110000
penalty paid to osha for citations arising from the incidents the usepa and
chemical safety board investigations are ongoing however no charges have been
filed or claims asserted honeywell has been served with several civil lawsuits
we do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or operating
cash flows

approximately 61000 were located in the united states









item 2  properties

    we have over 1000 locations consisting of plants research laboratories
sales offices and other facilities our headquarters and administrative complex
is located at morris township new jersey our plants are generally located to
serve large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and
labor pools our properties are generally maintained in good operating
condition utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and
other business conditions however no major operating facility is significantly
idle we own or lease warehouses railroad cars barges automobiles trucks
airplanes and materials handling and data processing equipment we also lease
space for administrative and sales staffs our properties and equipment are in
good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs we do not
anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding
alternative facilities

    securities available for future issuance under the supplemental
    nonqualified savings plan for highly compensated employees of honeywell

aerospace sales

    our sales to aerospace customers were 40 41 and 40 percent of our total
sales in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively our sales to commercial aerospace
original equipment manufacturers were 9 12 and 11 percent of our total sales in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively if there were a large decline in sales of
aircraft that use our components operating results could be negatively
impacted in addition our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of
aerospace products and services were 14 15 and 17 percent of our total sales in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively if there were a large decline in the number
of flight hours for aircraft that use our components or services operating
results could be negatively impacted the terrorist attacks on september 11
2001 resulted in an abrupt downturn in the aviation industry which was already
negatively impacted by a weak economy this dramatic downturn in the commercial
air transport industry continued to adversely impact the operating results of
our aerospace segment in 2002 in response we have accelerated our
costreduction actions to mitigate the impact of this downturn

us government sales

    sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting
through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors
amounted to 2277 2491 and 2219 million in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively which included sales to the us department of defense of 1833
1631 and 1548 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively us defense
spending increased in 2002 and is also expected to increase in 2003

    in addition to normal business risks companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual
risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design
improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry
changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly
development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices

                                       7





page
    we like other government contractors are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty we are not currently aware of any such investigations that we expect
individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on us in
addition we have a proactive business compliance program designed to ensure
compliance and sound business practices

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2002 and 2001 was 7332 and 7178 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 6194 million of the 2002
backlog will be filled in 2003 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option

competition

    we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions
competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services
provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular
customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors
such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance
applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity
service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for
our products and services and there is considerable price competition other
competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line
research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while
our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we
are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes
however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with
those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial
financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition
some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original
equipment manufacturers

international operations

    we are engaged in manufacturing sales and research and development mainly
in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and
foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations

    our international operations including us exports are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations including fluctuations in
currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls
employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions
including embargoes and governmental instability however we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate these risks

    financial information related to geographic areas is included in note 24 of
notes to financial statements in our 2002 annual report to shareowners which is
incorporated herein by reference

raw materials

    the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2002 we are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials however we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future a prolonged and substantial increase above recent
historical levels in petroleum prices would adversely affect our specialty
materials businesses which use petroleum byproducts as raw materials however
at present

                                       8





page
we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material
adverse impact during 2003

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights

    our business as a whole and that of our strategic business units are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or
distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which
relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are
of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are
obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others
we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate
for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights
under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our
operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of
patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process
or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business

    we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such
consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram anso and autolite

research and development

    our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes improvements in existing products and processes and
the development of new uses for existing products

    research and development expense totaled 757 832 and 818 million in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in research and development
expense in 2002 compared with 2001 relates mainly to lower spending by our
aerospace segment due primarily to program completions and fewer new program
launches by original equipment manufacturers customersponsored principally
the us government research and development activities amounted to an
additional 603 697 and 560 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

environment

    we are subject to various federal state and local government requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these
requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with
our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of
our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses

    we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies we believe that as a general matter our handling manufacture use
and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental laws and
regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other
developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies could bring into question our handling manufacture use
or disposal of these substances

    among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal
superfund law and similar state laws under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental
protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court
interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi
party situations taken as a whole

    further information regarding environmental matters is included in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations in our 2002 annual report to shareowners

employees

    we have approximately 108000 employees at december 31 2002 of which
approximately 63000 were located in the united states









item 2  properties

    we have over 1000 locations consisting of plants research laboratories
sales offices and other facilities our headquarters and administrative complex
is located at morristown new jersey our plants are generally located to serve
large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor
pools our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition
utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business
conditions however no major operating facility is significantly idle we own
or lease warehouses railroad cars barges automobiles trucks airplanes and
materials handling and data processing equipment we also lease space for
administrative and sales staffs our properties and equipment are in good
operating condition and are adequate for our present needs we do not anticipate
difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative
facilities

item 3  legal proceedings

    shareowner litigation  honeywell and seven of its current and former
officers were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits
filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the
securities law complaints the securities law complaints principally allege
that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly making false
and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information
concerning honeywells financial performance thereby allegedly causing the
value of honeywells stock to be artificially inflated on january 15 2002 the
district court dismissed the consolidated complaint against four of honeywells
current and former officers the court has granted plaintiffs motion for class
certification defining the purported class as all purchasers of honeywell stock
between december 20 1999 and june 19 2000

    the parties have agreed to participate in a two day settlement mediation in
april 2003 in an attempt to resolve the cases without resort to a trial all
significant discovery in the cases has been stayed pending further order of the
court

                                       10





page
    notwithstanding our agreement to mediate we believe there is no factual or
legal basis for the allegations in the securities law complaints although it is
not possible at this time to predict the litigation outcome of these cases we
expect to prevail if the cases are not resolved through mediation however an
adverse litigation outcome could be material to our consolidated financial
position or results of operations as a result of the uncertainty regarding the
outcome of this matter no provision has been made in our financial statements
with respect to this contingent liability

    environmental matters  we are subject to various federal state and local
government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety
and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and personal injury to our employees and employees of our
customers and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations however
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we
like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial
response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to
lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters including past
production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the
future

    with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we
continually conduct studies individually at our owned sites and jointly as a
member of industry groups at nonowned sites to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters it is our policy
to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when environmental
assessments are made or remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable
and the costs can be reasonably estimated with respect to site contamination
the timing of these accruals is generally no later than the completion of
feasibility studies we expect to fund expenditures for these matters from
operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of
factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of personal injury
and property damage claims regulatory approval of cleanup projects remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties

    although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations however
considering our past experience and existing reserves we do not expect that
these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position

    asbestos matters  like many other industrial companies honeywell is a
defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos we did not mine or
produce asbestos nor did we make or sell insulation products or other
construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of
asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants rather we made
several products that contained small amounts of asbestos

    honeywells bendix friction materials business manufactured automotive brake
pads that included asbestos in an encapsulated form there is a group of
potential claimants consisting largely of professional brake mechanics from
1981 through december 31 2002 we have resolved approximately 60000 bendix
claims at an average indemnity cost per claim of approximately two thousand
dollars through the second quarter of 2002 honeywell had no outofpocket
costs for these cases since its insurance deductible was satisfied many years
ago beginning with claim payments made in the third quarter of 2002 honeywell
began advancing indemnity and defense claim costs which amounted to
approximately 70 million in payments in the second half of 2002 a substantial
portion of this amount is expected to be reimbursed by insurance and 57 million
has been recorded as a receivable there are currently approximately 50000
claims pending and we have no reason to believe that the historic rate of
dismissal will change

    on january 30 2003 honeywell and federalmogul corp federalmogul
entered into a letter of intent loi pursuant to which federalmogul would
acquire honeywells automotive bendix friction materials bendix business with
the exception of certain usbased assets in exchange honeywell would receive
a permanent channeling injunction shielding it from all current and future
personal injury asbestos liabilities related to honeywells bendix business

                                       11

    federalmogul its us subsidiaries and certain of its united kingdom
subsidiaries voluntarily filed for financial restructuring under chapter 11 of
the us bankruptcy code in october 2001 federalmogul will seek to establish
one or more trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code as part of
its reorganization plan including a trust for the benefit of bendix asbestos
claimants the reorganization plan to be submitted to the bankruptcy court for
approval will contemplate that the us bankruptcy court in delaware would issue
an injunction in favor of honeywell that would channel to the bendix 524g
trust all present and future asbestos claims relating to honeywells bendix
business the 524g trust created for the benefit of the bendix claimants would
receive the rights to proceeds from honeywells bendix related insurance
policies and would make these proceeds available to the bendix claimants
honeywell would have no obligation to contribute any additional amounts toward
the settlement or resolution of bendix related asbestos claims

    in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge of 167 million
consisting of a 131 million reserve for the sale of bendix to federalmogul
our estimate of asbestos related liabilities net of insurance recoveries and
costs to complete the anticipated transaction with federalmogul completion of
the transaction contemplated by the loi is subject to the negotiation of
definitive agreements the confirmation of federalmoguls plan of
reorganization by the bankruptcy court the issuance of a final nonappealable
524g channeling injunction permanently enjoining any bendix related asbestos
claims against honeywell and the receipt of all required governmental
approvals we do not believe that completion of such transaction would have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
position there can be no assurance however that the transaction contemplated
by the loi will be completed honeywell presently has 2 billion of insurance
coverage remaining with respect to bendix related asbestos claims although it
is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims in light of
our potential exposure our prior experience in resolving these claims and our
insurance coverage we do not believe that the bendix related asbestos claims
will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or
financial position

    another source of claims is refractory products high temperature bricks and
cement sold largely to the steel industry in the east and midwest by north
american refractories company narco a business we owned from 1979 to 1986
less than 2 percent of narcos products contained asbestos

    when we sold the narco business in 1986 we agreed to indemnify narco with
respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior
to the sale as defined in the sale agreement narco retained all liability for
all other claims narco had resolved approximately 176000 claims through
january 4 2002 the date narco filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the
us bankruptcy code at an average cost per claim of two thousand two hundred
dollars of those claims 43 percent were dismissed on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence that narco was responsible for the claimants asbestos
exposure as of the date of narcos bankruptcy filing there were approximately
116000 remaining claims pending against narco including approximately 7
percent in which honeywell was also named as a defendant since 1983 honeywell
and our insurers have contributed to the defense and settlement costs associated
with narco claims we have approximately 2 billion of insurance remaining that
can be specifically allocated to narco related liability

    as a result of the narco bankruptcy filing all of the claims pending
against narco are automatically stayed pending the reorganization of narco in
addition because the claims pending against honeywell necessarily will impact
the liabilities of narco because the insurance policies held by honeywell are
essential to a successful narco reorganization and because honeywell has
offered to commit the value of those policies to the reorganization the
bankruptcy court has temporarily enjoined any claims against honeywell current
or future related to narco although the stay has been extended eleven times
since january 4 2002 there is no assurance that such stay will remain in
effect in connection with narcos bankruptcy filing we paid narcos parent
company 40 million and agreed to provide narco with up to 20 million in
financing we also agreed to pay 20 million to narcos parent company upon the
filing of a plan of reorganization for narco acceptable to honeywell and to pay
narcos parent company 40 million and to forgive any outstanding narco
indebtedness upon the confirmation and consummation of such a plan

    as a result of ongoing negotiations with counsel representing narco related
asbestos claimants regarding settlement of all pending and potential narco
related asbestos claims against honeywell

                                       12

we have reached definitive agreements or agreements in principle with
approximately 236000 claimants which represents approximately 90 percent of
the approximately 260000 current claimants who are now expected to file a claim
as part of the narco reorganization process we are also in discussions with the
narco committee of asbestos creditors on trust distribution procedures for
narco we believe that as part of the narco plan of reorganization a trust
will be established pursuant to these trust distribution procedures for the
benefit of all asbestos claimants current and future if the trust is put in
place and approved by the court as fair and equitable honeywell as well as
narco will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present
and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all
asbestos related claims based on exposure to narco products to be made against
the federallysupervised trust as part of its ongoing settlement negotiations
honeywell is seeking to cap its annual contributions to the trust with respect
to future claims at a level that would not have a material impact on honeywells
operating cash flows given the substantial progress of negotiations between
honeywell and narco related asbestos claimants and between honeywell and the
committee of asbestos creditors during the fourth quarter of 2002 honeywell has
developed an estimated liability for settlement of pending and future asbestos
claims

    during the fourth quarter 2002 honeywell recorded a charge of 14 billion
for narco related asbestos litigation charges net of insurance recoveries this
charge consists of the estimated liability to settle current asbestos related
claims the estimated liability related to future asbestos related claims
through 2018 and obligations to narcos parent net of insurance recoveries of
18 billion

    the estimated liability for current claims is based on terms and conditions
including evidentiary requirements in definitive agreements or agreements in
principle with approximately 90 percent of current claimants once finalized
settlement payments with respect to current claims are expected to be made over
approximately a fouryear period

    the liability for future claims estimates the probable value of future
asbestos related bodily injury claims asserted against narco over a 15 year
period and obligations to narcos parent as discussed above in light of the
uncertainties inherent in making longterm projections we do not believe that we
have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond 2018 under
statement of financial accounting standard no 5 accounting for contingencies
honeywell retained the expert services of hamilton rabinovitz and alschuler
inc hra to project the probable number and value including trust claim
handling costs of asbestos related future liabilities the methodology used to
estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous
courts and is the same methodology that is utilized by the expert who is
routinely retained by the asbestos claimants committee in asbestos related
bankruptcies the valuation methodology includes an analysis of the population
likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products epidemiological
studies to estimate the number of people likely to develop asbestos related
diseases narco claims filing history and the pending inventory of narco
asbestos related claims

    honeywell has substantial insurance that reimburses it for portions of the
costs incurred to settle narco related claims and court judgments as well as
defense costs this coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies
written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market
and the london excess market over onehalf of this coverage is with equitas and
other londonbased insurance companies with a majority of this coverage subject
to a coverageinplace agreement coverageinplace agreements are settlement
agreements between policyholders and the insurers specifying the terms and
conditions under which coverage will be applied as claims are presented for
payment these agreements govern such things as what events will be deemed to
trigger coverage how liability for a claim will be allocated among insurers and
what procedures the policyholder must follow in order to obligate the insurer to
pay claims we conducted an analysis to determine the amount of insurance that
we estimate is probable that we will recover in relation to payment of current
and projected future claims while the substantial majority of our insurance
carriers are solvent some of our individual carriers are insolvent which has
been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries some of our insurance
carriers have challenged our right to enter into settlement agreements resolving
all narco related asbestos claims against honeywell however we believe there
is no factual or legal basis for such challenges and we believe that it is
probable that we will prevail in the resolution of or in any litigation that is
brought regarding these disputes and have recognized approximately 900 million
in probable insurance recoveries from these carriers we made

                                       13





page
judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and
consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers our knowledge of any
pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial
determinations relevant to our insurance programs based on our analysis we
recorded insurance recoveries that are deemed probable through 2018 of
18 billion

    projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause
the narco related asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those
projected and recorded there is no assurance that ongoing settlement
negotiations will be successfully completed that a plan of reorganization will
be proposed or confirmed that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether
there will be any narco related asbestos claims beyond 2018 given the inherent
uncertainty in predicting future events we plan to review our estimates
periodically and update them based on our experience and other relevant
factors similarly we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable
insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other
developments that may impact insurance recoveries

    other matters  we are subject to a number of other lawsuits
investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising
out of the conduct of our business with respect to all these other matters
including those relating to commercial transactions government contracts
product liability and nonenvironmental health and safety matters while the
ultimate results of these lawsuits investigations and claims cannot be
determined we do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

aerospace sales

    our sales to aerospace customers were 41 40 and 42 percent of our total
sales in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively our sales to aerospace original
equipment manufacturers were 15 14 and 15 percent of our total sales in 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively if there were a large decline in sales of aircraft
that use our components operating results could be negatively impacted in
addition our sales to aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services
were 21 21 and 19 percent of our total sales in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively if there were a large decline in the number of flight hours for
aircraft that use our components or services operating results could be
negatively impacted the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 resulted in an
abrupt downturn in the aviation industry which was already negatively impacted
by a weak economy this dramatic downturn in the commercial air transport
industry will continue to adversely impact the operating results of our
aerospace segment in 2002 in response we have accelerated our costreduction
actions to mitigate the impact of this downturn

us government sales

    sales to the us government principally by our aerospace segment acting
through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors
amounted to 2491 2219 and 2383 million in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively which included sales to the us department of defense of 1631
1548 and 1415 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively we are affected
by us government budget constraints for defense and space programs us
defense spending increased in 2001 and is also expected to increase in 2002

    in addition to normal business risks companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual
risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design
improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry
changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly
development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices

    we like other government contractors are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty we are not currently aware of any such investigations that we expect
individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on us in
addition we have a proactive business compliance program designed to ensure
compliance and sound business practices

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2001 and 2000 was 7178 and 8094 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 5375 million of the 2001
backlog will be filled in 2002 we believe that

                                       7





page

backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a
substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at
the customers option

competition

    we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions
competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services
provided by us and vary country by country depending on the particular
customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of factors
such as price quality reliability delivery customer service performance
applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity
service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for
our products and services and there is considerable price competition other
competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line
research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability while
our competitive position varies among our products and services we believe we
are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes
however a number of our products and services are sold in competition with
those of a large number of other companies some of which have substantial
financial resources and significant technological capabilities in addition
some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original
equipment manufacturers

international operations

    we are engaged in manufacturing sales and research and development mainly
in the united states europe canada asia and latin america us exports and
foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations

    our international operations including us exports are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations including fluctuations in
currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls
employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions
including embargoes and governmental instability however we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate these risks

    financial information related to geographic areas is included in item 8
financial statements and supplementary data in note 25 of notes to financial
statements

raw materials

    the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2001 we are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials however we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future however at present we have no reason to believe a
shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2002

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights

    our business as a whole and that of our strategic business units are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or
distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years which
relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are
of importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are
obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others
we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies in our judgment those rights are adequate
for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the rights
under our patents trademarks and licenses are generally important to our
operations but we do not consider any patent trademark or related group of
patents or any licensing or distribution rights related to a

                                       8

specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our
total business see item 3 at page 10 of this form 10k for information
concerning litigation relating to patents in which we are involved

    we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such
consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram anso and autolite

research and development

    our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes improvements in existing products and processes and
the development of new uses for existing products

    research and development expense totaled 832 818 and 909 million in
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively customersponsored principally the us
government research and development activities amounted to an additional 697
560 and 682 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

environment

    we are subject to various federal state and local government requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these
requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with
our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of
our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses

    we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies we believe that as a general matter our handling manufacture use
and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental laws and
regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other
developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies could bring into question our handling manufacture use
or disposal of these substances

    among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal
superfund law and similar state laws under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental
protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court
interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi
party situations taken as a whole

    further information regarding environmental matters is included in item 7
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in
note 22 of notes to financial statements

employees

    we have approximately 115000 employees at december 31 2001 approximately
79000 were located in the united states and of these employees about 19
percent were unionized employees represented by various local or national
unions









item 2  properties

    we have over 1000 locations consisting of plants research laboratories
sales offices and other facilities our plants are generally located to serve
large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor
pools our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition
utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business
conditions however no major operating facility is significantly idle our
facilities together with planned expansions are expected to meet our needs for
the foreseeable future we own or lease warehouses railroad cars barges
automobiles trucks airplanes and materials handling and data processing

increase of 1288 million or 5 percent compared with 1999 the change in net
sales in 2001 and 2000 is attributable to the following

    cost of goods sold of 20429 19090 and 18495 million in 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively included merger repositioning and other charges of 2438
830 and 947 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively see item 8
financial statements and supplementary data in note 5 of notes to financial
statements for further discussion of the merger repositioning and other
charges excluding these charges cost of goods sold was 17991 18260 and
17548 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively excluding merger
repositioning and other charges cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was
761 730 and 739 percent in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase
in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000
principally reflected significantly lower sales in our specialty materials
segment and lower sales of highermargin aftermarket products and services in
our aerospace segment this increase was partially offset by lower costs due to
headcount reductions the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales
in 2000 compared with 1999 related principally to lower costs due to headcount
reductions and increased sales of highermargin aftermarket products and
services in our aerospace segment partially offset by higher raw materials
costs primarily in our specialty materials segment

    selling general and administrative expenses were 3064 3134 and 3216
million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively selling general and
administrative expenses included merger repositioning and other charges of 151
and 300 million in 2001 and 1999 respectively see item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 5 of notes to financial statements
for further discussion of the merger repositioning and other charges excluding
these charges selling general and administrative expenses were 2913 3134
and 2916 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively excluding merger
repositioning and other charges selling general and administrative expenses
as a percent of sales were 123 125 and 123 percent in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a
percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000 principally reflected the impact of
headcount reductions and a decline in discretionary spending for professional
services travel and overtime the increase in selling general and
administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2000 compared with 1999
principally reflected our acquisition of pittway which had a higher level of
selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales

    retirement benefit pension and other post retirement plans contributed
cost reductions of 165 282 and 61 million in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively principally due to the funding status of our pension plans
described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 23
of notes to financial statements and workforce reductions future effects on
operating results will principally depend on pension plan investment performance
and other economic conditions

    gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 112 million in 2000
represented the pretax gain on the governmentmandated divestiture of the tcas
product line of honeywell inc the former honeywell in connection with the
merger of alliedsignal inc and the former honeywell in december 1999 gain on
sale of nonstrategic businesses of 106 million in 1999 represented the pretax

    equity in income loss of affiliated companies was a loss of 193 and 89
million in 2001 and 2000 respectively and income of 76 million in 1999
equity in income loss of affiliated companies included repositioning and other
charges of 200 136 and 40 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively see
item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 5 of notes to
financial statements for further discussion of the repositioning and other
charges excluding these charges equity in income loss of affiliated
companies was income of 7 47 and 116 million in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively the decrease of 40 million in equity income in 2001 compared with
2000 was due mainly to the gain on the sale of our interest in an automotive
aftermarket joint venture in 2000 the decrease of 69 million in equity income
in 2000 compared with 1999 was due mainly to lower earnings from our uop process
technology uop joint venture partially offset by the gain on the sale of our
interest in an automotive aftermarket joint venture

    other income expense 17 million of income in 2001 decreased by 40
million compared with 2000 the current year included a net provision of 5
million consisting of a 6 million charge related to the redemption of our 200
million 5 34 dealer remarketable securities and a 1 million credit recognized
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended
excluding this net provision other income expense was 22 million of income
in 2001 a decrease of 35 million compared with 2000 due to a decrease in
benefits from foreign exchange hedging and lower interest income partially
offset by lower minority interests expense other income expense 57 million
of income in 2000 decreased by 250 million compared with 1999 the decrease
principally reflected the 1999 net gain of 268 million on our disposition of
our investment in amp common stock excluding this net gain other income
expense was 57 million of income in 2000 compared with 39 million of income
in 1999 this increase in other income of 18 million in 2000 was due
principally to lower minority interests expense and an increase in benefits from
foreign exchange hedging

    interest and other financial charges of 405 million in 2001 decreased by
76 million or 16 percent compared with 2000 due to lower average debt
outstanding and lower average interest rates in 2001 interest and other
financial charges of 481 million in 2000 increased by 216 million or
82 percent compared with 1999 the increase resulted from higher average debt
outstanding during 2000 due principally to our acquisition of pittway and our
share repurchase program higher average interest rates and the impact of tax
interest expense

    the effective tax benefit rate was 766 308 and 315 percent in 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively excluding the impact of merger repositioning and
other charges and gains on our sales of nonstrategic businesses and our
investment in amp the effective tax rate was 295 295 and 315 percent in
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in
2000 compared with 1999 related principally to tax synergies in europe
associated with the merger of alliedsignal inc and the former honeywell see
item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 9 of notes to
financial statements for further information

    net loss was 99 million or 012 per share in 2001 compared with net
income of 1659 million or 205 per share in 2000 adjusted for
repositioning and other charges net income in 2001 was 1771 million or 217
per share higher than reported adjusted for repositioning and other charges and
the gain on the disposition of the tcas product line of the former honeywell
net income in 2000 was 634 million or 078 per share higher than reported
net income in 2001 decreased by 27 percent compared with 2000 if both years are
adjusted to exclude the impact of repositioning and other charges and the gain
on the disposition of the tcas product line of the former honeywell net income
was 1659 million or 205 per share in 2000 compared with net income of
1541 million or 190 per share in 1999 adjusted for the gains on our
dispositions of our laminate systems business and our investment in amp and

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 24 of notes to
financial statements for further information on our reportable segments

    aerospace sales in 2001 were 9653 million a decrease of 335 million or
3 percent compared with 2000 this decrease principally reflected lower sales to
both commercial air transport aftermarket and original equipment customers and
the impact of prior year divestitures sales of original equipment to business
and general aviation customers were also lower this decrease was partially
offset by higher aftermarket sales to business and general aviation customers
sales to the military were also moderately higher the lower commercial sales
resulted from the abrupt downturn in the aviation industry following the
terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the already weak economy this
dramatic downturn in the commercial air transport industry will continue to
negatively impact the operating results of our aerospace segment in 2002 in
response we have accelerated our costreduction actions to mitigate the impact
of this downturn aerospace sales in 2000 were 9988 million an increase of
80 million or 1 percent compared with 1999 higher sales to the aftermarket
particularly repair and overhaul and the military and increased original
equipment sales to business and general aviation customers were partially offset
by lower sales to commercial air transport original equipment customers and a
decline in engineering services revenues sales also decreased due to the
effects of governmentmandated divestitures in connection with the merger of
alliedsignal and the former honeywell

    aerospace segment profit in 2001 was 1741 million a decrease of 454
million or 21 percent compared with 2000 this decrease related principally to
lower sales of highermargin aftermarket products higher retirement benefit
costs engineering and development costs related to new products and the impact
of prior year divestitures this decrease was partially offset by the impact of
cost

reduction actions primarily workforce reductions aerospace segment profit in
2000 was 2195 million an increase of 277 million or 14 percent compared
with 1999 due principally to coststructure improvements primarily from
workforce and retirement benefit cost reductions and mergerrelated savings
increased sales of highermargin aftermarket products and services also
contributed to the improvement in segment profit

    automation and control solutions sales in 2001 were 7185 million a
decrease of 199 million or 3 percent compared with 2000 excluding the impact
of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures sales decreased
approximately 2 percent this decrease resulted primarily from lower sales for
our control products business primarily due to weakness in key endmarkets our
service business also had lower sales due primarily to weakness in our security
monitoring business this decrease was partially offset by higher sales for our
industry solutions business sales were also higher for our security and fire
solutions business due principally to our acquisition of pittway in the prior
year automation and control solutions sales in 2000 were 7384 million an
increase of 1269 million or 21 percent compared with 1999 due principally to
higher sales for our security and fire solutions business due to our acquisition
of pittway in february 2000 sales for our control products business also
increased this increase was partially offset by lower sales in our service and
industry solutions businesses our industry solutions business was adversely
affected by weakness in the hydrocarbon processing industry sales for the
segment were also adversely impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the
strong dollar

    automation and control solutions segment profit in 2001 was 819 million a
decrease of 167 million or 17 percent compared with 2000 this decrease
resulted principally from lower sales for our control products and service
businesses higher raw material costs and pricing pressures across the segment
higher retirement benefit costs and the impact of prior year divestitures this
decrease was partially offset by the impact of costreduction actions primarily
workforce reductions automation and control solutions segment profit in 2000
was 986 million an increase of 219 million or 29 percent compared with 1999
segment profit improved primarily as a result of lower costs due to workforce
and benefit cost reductions and mergerrelated savings our acquisition of
pittway and other portfolio changes also contributed to the improvement in
segment profit

    specialty materials sales in 2001 were 3313 million a decrease of 742
million or 18 percent compared with 2000 excluding the effect of divestitures
sales decreased 13 percent this decrease was driven by a substantial decline in
sales for our electronic materials business due to weakness in the electronics
and telecommunications markets sales were also lower for our nylon system and
performance fibers businesses due to weakness in the carpet and automotive
endmarkets specialty materials sales in 2000 were 4055 million an increase
of 48 million or 1 percent compared with 1999 higher sales of advanced
circuitry and waferfabrication products were largely offset by the impact of
divestitures principally our laminate systems business

    specialty materials segment profit in 2001 was 52 million a decrease of
282 million or 84 percent compared with 2000 this decrease resulted primarily
from lower volumes and price declines principally in our electronic materials
nylon system and performance fibers businesses higher energy and raw material
costs principally in our nylon system and performance fibers businesses and the
impact of prior year divestitures also contributed to the decrease in segment
profit by the end of 2001 we began to experience lower energy and raw
materials costs in these businesses this decrease in segment profit was
partially offset by the impact of costreduction actions principally plant
shutdowns and workforce reductions specialty materials segment profit in 2000
was 334 million a decrease of 105 million or 24 percent compared with 1999
this decrease principally reflected higher energy and raw material costs
primarily in our nylon system and performance fibers businesses and higher
operating losses in our chip packaging and pharmaceutical chemicals businesses
this decrease was partially offset by coststructure improvements and price
increases in certain specialty materials businesses

    transportation and power systems sales in 2001 were 3457 million a
decrease of 70 million or 2 percent compared with 2000 excluding the effects
of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures sales were flat sales were
significantly higher for our garrett engine boosting systems business due to
continued strong demand for turbochargers in the european dieselpowered

passenger car market this increase was offset by lower sales for our bendix
commercial vehicle systems business due to decreased heavyduty truck builds in
north america and lower sales for our friction materials and consumer products
group businesses due to weakness in automotive endmarkets transportation and
power systems sales in 2000 were 3527 million a decrease of 54 million or
2 percent compared with 1999 due mainly to lower sales for our bendix commercial
vehicle systems and friction materials businesses sales for our bendix
commercial vehicles systems business were negatively impacted by decreased
heavyduty truck builds sales for our friction materials business were lower
mainly due to foreign currency fluctuations this decrease was partially offset
by higher sales for our garrett engine boosting systems business as continued
strong worldwide demand for turbochargers more than offset the adverse impact
of foreign currency fluctuations

    transportation and power systems segment profit in 2001 was 289 million an
increase of 15 million or 5 percent compared with 2000 due to higher sales in
our garrett engine boosting systems business and the impact of repositioning
actions across all businesses the shutdown of our turbogenerator product line
in 2001 and the fact that the prior year included costs associated with a
product recall in our bendix commercial vehicle systems business also
contributed to an improvement in segment profit in 2001 this increase was
partially offset by the impact of lower sales in our bendix commercial vehicle
systems consumer products group and friction materials businesses
transportation and power systems segment profit in 2000 was 274 million a
decrease of 48 million or 15 percent compared with 1999 this decrease
primarily reflected costs associated with a product recall and lower sales in
our bendix commercial vehicle systems business costs related to the rampup of
our turbogenerator product line and costs associated with a supplier issue in
our garrett engine boosting systems business this decrease was partially offset
by the effects of coststructure improvements in our friction materials and
consumer products group businesses and higher sales in our garrett engine
boosting systems business

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

    we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the principal
source of our liquidity we continuously assess the relative strength of each
business in our portfolio as to strategic fit market position profit and cash
flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify
business units that will most benefit from increased investment we identify
acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our
existing core businesses we also identify business units that do not fit into
our longterm strategic plan based on their market position relative
profitability or growth potential these business units are considered for
potential divestiture restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to
regulatory constraints considering the current economic environment in which
each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies including
our focus on cost reduction and productivity initiatives we believe that our
operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity our
available cash committed credit lines access to the public debt markets using
debt securities and commercial paper as well as our ability to sell trade
accounts receivables provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm
liquidity to fund current operations and future investment opportunities based
on our current financial position and expected economic performance we do not
believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access
our sources of financing

    total assets at december 31 2001 were 24226 million a decrease of 949
million or 4 percent from december 31 2000 inventories and accounts
receivable were lower compared with the prior yearend driven by an improvement
in working capital performance the decrease in total assets also resulted from
asset writedowns included in repositioning and other charges which are
discussed in detail in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in
note 5 of notes to financial statements total assets at december 31 2000 were
25175 million an increase of 1648 million or 7 percent from december 31
1999 this increase related principally to our acquisition of pittway in
february 2000

    cash provided by operating activities of 1996 million during 2001
increased by 7 million compared with 2000 this increase was driven by an
improvement in working capital performance offset by lower net income excluding
noncash repositioning and other charges and gains on sales of

nonstrategic businesses in both years cash provided by operating activities of
1989 million during 2000 decreased by 385 million compared with 1999 due
principally to spending related to merger and repositioning actions a
deterioration in working capital performance and higher pension income this
decrease was partially offset by lower taxes paid on sales of businesses and
investments and higher net income excluding noncash merger repositioning and
other charges and gains on sales of nonstrategic businesses and our investment
in amp in both years

    cash used for investing activities of 906 million during 2001 decreased by
1808 million compared with 2000 due principally to our acquisition of pittway
in 2000 this decrease was partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of
businesses and property plant and equipment and a slight increase in capital
spending cash used for investing activities of 2714 million during 2000
increased by 2423 million compared with 1999 our acquisition of pittway the
fact that the prior year included the net proceeds from our disposition of our
investment in amp and lower proceeds from sales of businesses were principally
responsible for the increase this increase was partially offset by lower
capital spending in 2000

    capital expenditures were 876 853 and 986 million in 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively spending by the reportable segments and corporate since 1999
is shown in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 24 of
notes to financial statements our total capital expenditures in 2002 are
currently projected at approximately 735 million the expected decrease in
capital spending in 2002 principally reflects our intention to limit capital
spending at nonstrategic businesses these expenditures are expected to be
financed principally by cash provided by operating activities and are primarily
intended for expansion and cost reduction

    cash used for financing activities of 893 million during 2001 increased by
823 million compared with 2000 this increase resulted principally from reduced
longterm borrowings in the current year during 2001 we issued 500 million of
5 18 notes due 2006 500 million of 6 18 notes due 2011 and 247 million of
525 notes due 2006 during 2000 we issued 1 billion of 750 notes due 2010
and 750 million of 6875 notes due 2005 total debt of 5270 million at
december 31 2001 was 353 million or 6 percent lower than at december 31
2000 this decrease resulted from lower levels of commercial paper outstanding
at the current yearend the increase in cash used for financing activities also
resulted from lower proceeds from issuances of common stock partially offset by
lower repurchases of common stock cash used for financing activities of 70
million during 2000 decreased by 1040 million compared with 1999 led
principally by a decrease in stock repurchases and higher net issuances of debt
during 2000 we repurchased 43 million shares of our common stock for 166
million in connection with our share repurchase program which was rescinded
effective october 21 2000 total debt of 5623 million at december 31 2000
was 557 million or 11 percent higher than at december 31 1999 due to our
acquisition of pittway

    we maintain a 2 billion bank revolving credit facility which is comprised
of a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and b a 1 billion 364day
credit agreement the credit agreements were established for general corporate
purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper there was 3
and 1192 million of commercial paper outstanding at yearend 2001 and 2000
respectively see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in

    we have entered into agreements to lease land equipment and buildings
principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years and
some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions at any time during
the terms of some of our leases we may at our option purchase the leased assets
for amounts that approximate fair value if we elect not to purchase the assets
at the end of each such lease we have guaranteed the residual values of the
underlying assets principally aircraft equipment buildings and land we have
also issued or are party to various direct and indirect guarantees of the debt
of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties the minimum operating lease
payments residual value guarantees and maximum amount of unconsolidated
affiliates and third party guarantees are reflected in the above table we do
not expect that any of our commercial commitments will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or
liquidity

merger repositioning and other charges

    in 2001 we recognized a repositioning charge of 1016 million for the
cost of actions designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our future
profitability these actions consisted of announced global workforce reductions
of approximately 20000 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of
our reportable segments of which approximately 15000 positions have been
eliminated as of december 31 2001 these actions are expected to be completed
by september 30 2002 the repositioning charge also included asset impairments
and other exit costs related to plant closures and the rationalization of
manufacturing capacity and infrastructure principally in our specialty
materials engines systems and services and transportation and power systems
businesses including the shutdown of our turbogenerator product line the
components of the charge included severance costs of 727 million asset
impairments of 194 million and other exit costs of 95 million consisting of
contract cancellations and penalties including lease terminations negotiated
or subject to reasonable estimation also 119 million of previously
established accruals mainly for severance were returned to income in 2001 due
principally to higher than expected voluntary employee attrition resulting in
reduced severance liabilities principally in our aerospace and automation and
control solutions reportable segments

    in 2000 we recognized a repositioning charge of 239 million related to
announced global workforce reductions across all of our reportable segments
costs to close a chip package manufacturing plant and related workforce
reductions and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shutdowns in our specialty materials
reportable segment the components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of 151 million and asset impairments of 88 million the
announced workforce reductions consisted of approximately 2800 manufacturing
and administrative positions which are complete asset impairments were
principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and
capable of being taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of
impairment also 46 million of previously established accruals principally
for severance were returned to income in 2000 due to higher than expected
voluntary employee attrition resulting in reduced severance liabilities
principally in our automation and control solutions and aerospace reportable
segments we also recognized a repositioning charge of 99 million in equity in
income loss of affiliated companies for costs to close an affiliates chemical
manufacturing operations the components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of 6 million asset impairments of 53 million and other
environmental exit costs and period expenses of 40 million

    in 1999 upon completion of the merger between alliedsignal and the former
honeywell we recognized a repositioning charge of 642 million for the cost of
actions designed to improve our combined competitiveness productivity and
future profitability the mergerrelated actions included the elimination of
redundant corporate offices and functional administrative overhead elimination
of redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses adoption of six sigma productivity initiatives at the former
honeywell businesses and the transition to a global shared services model the
components of the repositioning charge included severance costs of 342 million
asset impairments of 108 million other exit costs of 57 million and
mergerrelated transaction and period expenses of 135 million global workforce
reductions consisted of approximately 6500 administrative and manufacturing
positions which are complete asset impairments were principally related to the
elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace facilities and
equipment other exit costs were related to lease terminations and contract
cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation at yearend
mergerrelated transaction and period expenses consisted of investment banking
and legal fees former honeywell deferred compensation vested upon change in
control and other direct mergerrelated expenses incurred in the period the
merger was completed all mergerrelated actions are complete

    in 1999 we also recognized a repositioning charge of 321 million for the
cost of actions designed to reposition principally the alliedsignal businesses
for improved productivity and future profitability these actions included the
organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to strengthen market
focus and simplify business structure elimination of an unprofitable product
line closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant and rationalization
of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our specialty materials
reportable segment a reduction in the infrastructure in our garrett engine
boosting systems business elimination of two manufacturing facilities in our
electronic materials business a plant closure and outsourcing activity in our
automotive consumer products group business and related and general workforce
reductions in all alliedsignal businesses and our automation and control
solutions reportable segment the components of the repositioning charge
included severance costs of 140 million asset impairments of 149 million and
other exit costs of 32 million global workforce reductions consisted of
approximately 5100 manufacturing administrative and sales positions which
are complete asset impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant
and equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and
actively marketed in the period of impairment other exit costs principally
consisted of environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant shutdowns
all repositioning actions excluding environmental remediation are complete

    these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax
savings of approximately 760 million in 2002 compared with 2001 principally
from planned workforce reductions and facility consolidations cash expenditures
for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute these actions were 422
and 344 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively such expenditures for severance
and other exit costs have been funded through operating cash flows proceeds
from sales of nonstrategic businesses and government required divestitures
resulting from the merger of alliedsignal and the former honeywell and sale of
mergerrelated excess or duplicate facilities and equipment cash expenditures
for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining 2001
actions will approximate 500 million in 2002 and will be funded principally
through operating cash flows

    in 2001 we recognized other charges consisting of a settlement of the
litton systems inc litigation for 440 million see item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 22 of notes to financial statements
for further discussion probable and reasonably estimable legal and
environmental claims of 408 million see item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data in note 22 of notes to financial statements for further
discussion customer claims and settlements of contract liabilities of 310
million and writeoffs principally related to asset impairments including
receivables and inventories of 335 million in 2001 we adopted a plan to
dispose of our friction materials business and held discussions with a potential
acquiror of the business the friction materials business was designated as held
for disposal and we recognized an impairment charge of 145 million related to
the writedown of property plant and equipment goodwill and other identifiable
intangible assets to their fair value less costs to sell we recognized charges
of 112 million related to an other than temporary decline in the value of an
equity investment and an equity investees loss

contract and a 100 million charge for writeoff of investments including
inventory related to a regional jet engine contract cancellation we also
recognized 42 million of transaction expenses related to the proposed merger
with ge and redeemed our 200 million 5 34 dealer remarketable securities due
2011 resulting in a loss of 6 million

    in 2000 we identified certain business units and manufacturing facilities
as noncore to our business strategy as a result of this assessment we
implemented cost reduction initiatives and conducted discussions with potential
acquirors of these businesses and assets as part of this process we evaluated
the businesses and assets for possible impairment as a result of our analysis
we recognized impairment charges in 2000 of 245 and 165 million principally
related to the writedown of property plant and equipment goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets of our friction materials business and a chemical
manufacturing facility respectively we recognized other charges consisting of
probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities of 87 million and
contract claims mergerrelated period expenses other contingencies and
writeoffs of tangible assets removed from service including inventory
totaling 140 million in addition we recognized a charge of 37 million for
costs principally related to an equity investees customer claims

    in 1999 we recognized other charges consisting of losses on aerospace
engine maintenance contracts and a contract cancellation penalty totaling 45
million customer and employee claims of 69 million contract settlements and
contingent liabilities of 18 million and other writeoffs principally related
to tangible and intangible assets removed from service including inventory of
152 million we also recognized a 36 million charge resulting from an other
than temporary decline in value of an equity investment due to a significant
deterioration in market conditions and a 4 million charge related to an equity
investees severance action involving approximately 220 employees

environmental matters

    we are subject to various federal state and local government requirements
relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we
believe that as a general matter our policies practices and procedures are
properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and
personal injury to our employees and employees of our customers and that our
handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in
accord with environmental laws and regulations however mainly because of past
operations and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies
engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial response and voluntary
cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims
associated with environmental matters including past production of products
containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims and costs involving
environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future

    with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we
continually conduct studies individually at our owned sites and jointly as a
member of industry groups at nonowned sites to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters with respect to
environmental matters involving the production of products containing toxic
substances we believe that the costs of defending and resolving such matters
will be largely covered by insurance subject to deductibles exclusions
retentions and policy limits it is our policy see item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 1 of notes to financial statements
to record appropriate liabilities

                                       21

for environmental matters when environmental assessments are made or remedial
efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated with respect to site contamination the timing of these accruals is
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies we expect that we
will be able to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow
the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors including the
timing of litigation and settlements of personal injury and property damage
claims insurance recoveries regulatory approval of cleanup projects remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties

    remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were 82 75 and 78
million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively and are currently estimated to be
approximately 77 million in 2002 we expect that we will be able to fund such
expenditures from operating cash flow

    remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax
earnings were 152 110 and 23 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
at december 31 2001 and 2000 the recorded liability for environmental matters
was 456 and 386 million respectively in addition in 2001 and 2000 we
incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 75 and 80
million respectively relating to compliance with environmental regulations

    although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations however
considering our past experience insurance coverage and reserves we do not
expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position

    see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 5 of notes
to financial statements for a discussion of our legal and environmental charges
and in note 22 of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our
commitments and contingencies including those related to environmental matters
and toxic tort litigation

financial instruments

    as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial
position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate
and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing
activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial
instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other
speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments
a summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is
included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 1 of
notes to financial statements

    we conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of
foreign currencies our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency
exchange rates arises from international financing activities between
subsidiaries foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and
anticipated transactions arising from international trade our objective is to
preserve the economic value of cash flows in nonfunctional currencies we
attempt to have all transaction exposures hedged with natural offsets to the
fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted
through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties our
principal currency exposures relate to the euro countries the british pound
the canadian dollar and the us dollar

    our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our debt obligations as described in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data in notes 16 and 18 of notes to financial statements we
issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage
our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs

    financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty
credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk
through specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties
and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are

                                       22

substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using
such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities

    the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for
interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate
onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities the
potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments
based on a 10 percent increase in us dollar per local currency exchange rates
across all maturities and the potential change in fair value of contracts
hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the
underlying commodity across all maturities at december 31 2001 and 2000

1 asset or liability

2 excludes capitalized leases

3 changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset
    by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign
    currency transactions

4 changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by
    changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions

the above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated
changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are
forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market
conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these
estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets
the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be
considered projections of future events

critical accounting policies

    the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and
subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies

                                       23





page

data in note 1 of notes to financial statements contains a detailed summary of
our significant accounting policies we believe that a number of our accounting
policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of
operations following is a summary of those accounting policies that we believe
are our critical accounting policies the judgments and uncertainties affecting
the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different
amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions

    sales recognition  product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
assured sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and automation and
control solutions segments are recorded on a percentageofcompletion method
measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the
unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts provisions for
anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recorded in full when such losses
become evident

    we apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are
consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions upon
recognizing longterm contract sales judgment must be applied to ensure that
anticipated losses are properly recognized in the period that they become
evident longterm contract loss experience is dependent upon the economic
health of our customers who are principally in the aerospace and automation and
control segments as well as our ability to estimate contract cost inputs and
perform according to contract terms and conditions we believe that all relevant
conditions and assumptions are considered when recognizing sales and contract
losses

    accounting for contingent liabilities  we are subject to a number of
lawsuits investigations and claims some of which involve substantial dollar
amounts that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations these
contingencies relate to commercial transactions government contracts product
liabilities and environmental health and safety matters as enumerated in item
8 financial statements and supplementary data in notes 1 and 22 of notes to
financial statements we recognize a liability for any contingency that is
probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable based on our judgment although
it is impossible to predict the outcome of any lawsuit investigation or claim
item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 22 of notes to
financial statements provides a summary of all material contingencies currently
pending against us and our expectations related to the financial outcome of each
contingency

    longlived assets including tangible and intangible assets and goodwill 
to conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy we acquire
tangible and intangible assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of
the carrying amount of our longlived assets including property plant and
equipment goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating earnings we continually
apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the
timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess
impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic
environment in which each of our businesses operate and the resulting
assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of all
impairment tests

    pension and other postretirement benefits  we maintain pension plans
covering a majority of our employees and retirees and postretirement benefit
plans for retirees that include health care benefits and life insurance coverage
see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 23 of notes
to financial statements for additional details for financial reporting
purposes net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs income
are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount
rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets
assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees and an annual
rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare
benefits each of these assumptions is based upon our judgment considering all
known trends and uncertainties actual asset returns for our pension plans
significantly below our assumed rate of return would result in lower

                                       24

net periodic pension income or higher expense in future years actual annual
rates of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare
benefits above assumed rates of increase would result in higher net periodic
postretirement benefit costs in future years

euro conversion

    on january 1 1999 certain member countries of the european union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
european unions common currency euro the transition period for the
introduction of the euro was between january 1 1999 and january 1 2002 we are
ensuring that euro conversion compliance issues are addressed and do not expect
any adverse consequences

sales to the us government

    sales to the us government acting through its various departments and
agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 2491 2219 and 2383
million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively this included sales to the
department of defense dod as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 1631
1548 and 1415 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively sales to the dod
accounted for 69 62 and 60 percent of our total sales in 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively we are affected by us government budget constraints for
defense and space programs us defense spending increased in 2001 and is also
expected to increase in 2002

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2001 and 2000 was 7178 and 8094 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 5375 million of the 2001
backlog will be filled in 2002 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option

inflation

    highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflations impact on
the selling prices of our products and the costs of our purchased materials
cost increases for materials and labor have generally been low and productivity
enhancement programs including six sigma initiatives have largely offset any
impact

                 dollars in millions except per share amounts

note 1  summary of significant accounting policies

    honeywell international inc is a diversified technology and manufacturing
company serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services
control technologies for buildings homes and industry automotive products
specialty chemicals fibers plastics and electronic and advanced materials as
described in note 2 honeywell international inc was formed upon the merger of
alliedsignal inc and honeywell inc in 1999 the following is a description of
the significant accounting policies of honeywell international inc

    principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of honeywell international inc and all of its subsidiaries in
which a controlling interest is maintained all intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation

    inventories  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using
the firstin firstout or the average cost method and the lastin firstout
lifo method for certain qualifying domestic inventories

    investments  investments in affiliates over which we have a significant
influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting other investments are carried at market value if readily
determinable or cost all equity investments are periodically reviewed to
determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are otherthantemporary
significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices and a series of
historic and projected operating losses by investees are considered in the
review if the decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary
an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new cost
basis

    property plant and equipment  property plant and equipment are recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation for financial reporting the straight
line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery
and equipment

    goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a
straightline basis over appropriate periods up to 40 years accumulated
amortization was 1148 and 974 million at december 31 2001 and 2000
respectively

    other intangible assets  other intangible assets include investments in
longterm contracts patents trademarks customer lists and other items
amortized on a straightline basis over the expected period benefited by future
cash inflows up to 25 years accumulated amortization was 548 and 498 million
at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively

    longlived assets  we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the
carrying amount of longlived assets including property plant and equipment
goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating earnings we also
continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all longlived assets and
periodically revise such estimates based on current events

    sales recognition  product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
assured sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and automation and
control solutions segments are recorded on a percentageofcompletion method
measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the
unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts provisions for
anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recorded in full when such
losses become evident

                  notes to financial statements  continued
                 dollars in millions except per share amounts

    environmental expenditures  environmental expenditures that relate to
current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
provide future benefits are expensed as incurred liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated the timing of these accruals is generally no
later than the completion of feasibility studies the liabilities for
environmental costs recorded in accrued liabilities and other liabilities at
december 31 2001 were 81 and 375 million respectively and at december 31
2000 were 171 and 215 million respectively

    foreign currency translation  assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the united states with a functional currency other than us
dollars are translated into us dollars using yearend exchange rates sales
costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates effective during
the year foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of accumulated other nonowner changes for subsidiaries operating in
highly inflationary environments inventories and property plant and equipment
including related expenses are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the
date the assets were acquired while monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these
operations are included in earnings

    derivative instruments and hedging activities  statement of financial
accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended sfas no 133 is effective january 1 2001 under sfas
no 133 all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value for derivatives designated as hedges of
the fair value of assets or liabilities the changes in fair values of both the
derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings for
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the changes
in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other nonowner
changes and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact
income changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and
the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recorded in current earnings

    our adoption of sfas no 133 as of january 1 2001 resulted in a cumulative
effect adjustment of 1 million of income that is included in other income
expense this accounting change impacts only the pattern and timing of noncash
accounting recognition for derivatives and did not significantly impact 2001
operating results

    transfers of financial instruments  sales transfers and securitization of
financial instruments are accounted for under statement of financial accounting
standards no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets
and extinguishments of liabilities we sell interests in designated pools of
trade accounts receivables to a third party the receivables are removed from
the consolidated balance sheet at the time they are sold the value assigned to
undivided interests retained in trade receivables sold is based on the relative
fair values of the interests retained and sold the carrying value of the
retained interests approximates fair value due to the shortterm nature of the
receivable collection period

    income taxes  deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary
differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax
reporting such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax
rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a
valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which
realization is not likely

    research and development  research and development costs for company
sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred such
costs are classified as part of cost of goods sold and were 832 818 and
909 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

    earnings per share  basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings per share is based
on the weighted average number of

                 dollars in millions except per share amounts

common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
all earnings per share data in this report reflect earnings per share 
assuming dilution unless otherwise indicated

    cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand
and on deposit and highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less

    use of estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial
statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes actual results
could differ from those estimates estimates and assumptions are periodically
reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary

    recent accounting pronouncements  in august 2001 the financial accounting
standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no
144 the provisions of which are effective for us on january 1 2002 sfas no
144 provides guidance on the accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 144
will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and
financial position

    in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 the
provisions of which are effective for us on january 1 2003 sfas no 143
requires entities to recognize the fair value of a liability for tangible
longlived asset retirement obligations in the period incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made we are currently evaluating the effect that
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 143 will have on our consolidated
results of operations and financial position

    in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 and statement of financial
accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas
no 142 sfas no 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after
june 30 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method only and that certain
acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets
apart from goodwill we adopted sfas no 141 in 2001 which did not have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial
condition sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and certain other intangible
assets having indefinite lives no longer be amortized to income but instead be
replaced with periodic testing for impairment intangible assets determined to
have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives the
amortization and nonamortization provisions of sfas no 142 have been applied
to any goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 with respect
to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july 1 2001 we are
required to adopt sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 we are currently
evaluating the effect if any of the application of the goodwill impairment

subsidiary of alliedsignal at the effective time of the merger alliedsignal was
renamed honeywell international inc honeywell

    the former honeywell shareowners received 1875 shares of honeywell common
stock for each share of the former honeywell common stock with cash paid in lieu
of any fractional shares as a result former honeywell shareowners received
approximately 241 million shares of honeywell common stock valued at
approximately 15 billion at the merger date in addition outstanding former
honeywell employee stock options were converted at the same exchange factor into
options to purchase approximately 10 million shares of honeywell common stock

    the merger qualified as a taxfree reorganization and was accounted for
under the poolingofinterests accounting method accordingly honeywells
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to
the merger to include the results of operations financial position and cash
flows of the former honeywell as though it had always been a part of honeywell

    there were no material transactions between alliedsignal and the former
honeywell prior to the merger and there were no material adjustments to conform

    all the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of
acquisition the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
net assets acquired of 42 1678 and 678 million in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over estimated
useful lives in connection with these acquisitions the amounts recorded for
transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into
honeywell were not material the results of operations of the acquired
businesses have been included in the consolidated results of honeywell from
their respective acquisition dates the pro forma results for 2001 2000 and

dates through 2019 the use of preacquisition operating losses is subject to
limitations imposed by the internal revenue code we do not anticipate that
these limitations will affect utilization of the carryforwards prior to their
expiration we also have foreign net operating losses of 807 million which are
available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries subject to
varying expiration rules

    we have us tax credit carryforwards of 167 million at december 31 2001
including carryforwards of 124 million with various expiration dates and tax
credits of 43 million which are not subject to expiration

    the increase in the valuation allowance of 47 million in 2001 is primarily
due to an increase in foreign net operating losses attributable to a specialty
materials business that are not expected to be utilized

    deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately 20 billion
of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered
to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of
tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings

    cash payments of income taxes during the years 2001 2000 and 1999 were 79
442 and 625 million respectively

of the common shares during the period in 2000 and 1999 the number of stock
options not included in the computations was 14563673 and 868631

    we maintain 2 billion of bank revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks which are comprised of a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and
b a 1 billion 364day credit agreement the credit agreements are maintained
for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial
paper we had no balance outstanding under either agreement at december 31
2001

    neither of the credit agreements restricts our ability to pay dividends and
neither contains financial covenants the failure to comply with customary
conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the
credit agreements would prevent any further borrowings and would generally
require the repayments of any outstanding borrowings under such credit
agreements such events of default include a nonpayment of credit agreement
debt and interest b noncompliance with the terms of the credit agreement
covenants c default on other debt in certain circumstances d bankruptcy
and e defaults upon obligations under the employee retirement income security
act additionally each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment
to lend under the credit

    we have entered into agreements to lease land equipment and buildings
principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years and
some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions at any time during
the terms of some of our leases we may at our option purchase the leased assets
for amounts that approximate fair value if we elect not to purchase the assets
at the end of each such lease we have guaranteed the residual values of the
underlying assets principally aircraft equipment buildings and land
totaling approximately 349 million at december 31 2001 we do not expect that
any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or

note 18  financial instruments

    as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices which may adversely affect our operating results and financial
position we minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate
and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing
activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial
instruments

    credit and market risk  financial instruments including derivatives
expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk
related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our
exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards
diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of
credit risk our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks
with significant experience using such derivative instruments we monitor the
impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and
other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest
and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial
instruments to hedging activities we do not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged
derivative financial instruments

    we continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we
grant credit terms in the normal course of business while concentrations of
credit risk associated with our trade accounts and notes receivable are
considered minimal due to our diverse customer base a significant portion of
our customers are in the commercial aviation industry aircraft manufacturers
and airlines accounting for approximately 19 percent of our consolidated sales
in 2001 following the abrupt downturn in the aviation industry after the
terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the already weak economy we
modified terms and conditions of our credit sales to mitigate or eliminate
concentrations of credit risk with any single customer our sales are not
materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers

    foreign currency risk management  we conduct our business on a
multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies our exposure to
market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from
international financing activities between subsidiaries foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising
from international trade our objective is to preserve the economic value of
cash flows in nonfunctional currencies we attempt to have all transaction
exposures hedged with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once
these opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and
option agreements with third parties our principal currency exposures relate to
the euro countries the british pound the canadian dollar and the us dollar

    we hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
prior to conversion into us dollars these assets and liabilities are
remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date the
effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in
other income expense we hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange
rates principally with forward contracts forward contracts are markedtomarket
with the resulting gains and losses similarly recognized in earnings offsetting
the gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
liabilities being hedged

    we partially hedge forecasted 2002 sales and purchases denominated in
foreign currencies with currency forward contracts when the dollar strengthens
against foreign currencies the decline in value of forecasted foreign currency
cash inflows sales or outflows purchases is partially offset by the
recognition of gains sales and losses purchases respectively in the value
of the forward contracts designated as hedges conversely when the dollar
weakens against foreign currencies the increase in value of forecasted foreign
currency cash inflows sales or outflows purchases is partially offset by the
recognition of losses sales and gains purchases respectively in the value
of the forward

contracts designated as hedges market value gains and losses on these contracts
are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized deferred
gains and losses on forward contracts used to hedge forecasted sales and
purchases were 2 and 2 million respectively at december 31 2001 the
deferred gains and losses are expected to be reclassified into sales and cost of
goods sold within the next twelve months all open forward contracts mature by
december 31 2002

    at december 31 2001 and 2000 we had contracts with notional amounts of
1507 and 1542 million respectively to exchange foreign currencies
principally in the euro countries and great britain

    commodity price risk management  our exposure to market risk for commodity
prices arises from changes in our cost of production we mitigate our exposure
to commodity price risk through the use of longterm firmprice contracts with
our suppliers and forward commodity purchase agreements with third parties
hedging anticipated purchases of several commodities principally natural gas
forward commodity purchase agreements are markedtomarket with the resulting
gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is
recognized

     interest rate risk management  we use a combination of financial
instruments including mediumterm and shortterm financing variablerate
commercial paper and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our
total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing at december 31 2001
and 2000 interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
effectively changed 1096 and 1600 million respectively of fixed rate debt
at an average rate of 655 and 710 percent respectively to libor based
floating rate debt our interest rate swaps mature through 2007

and shortterm borrowings contained in the consolidated balance sheet
approximates fair value summarized below are the carrying values and fair
values of our other financial instruments at december 31 2001 and 2000 the
fair values are based on the quoted market prices for the issues if traded

    litton litigation  on march 13 1990 litton systems inc litton filed
a legal action against the former honeywell in us district court central
district of california los angeles with claims that were subsequently split
into two separate cases one alleged patent infringement under federal law for
using an ionbeam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the former honeywells
ring laser gyroscopes and tortious interference under state law for interfering
with littons prospective advantage with customers and contractual relationships
with an inventor and his company ojai research inc the other case alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal antitrust laws by the
former honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems containing ring laser
gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market on december 21 2001 we settled
the litton legal action for 440 million reaching a settlement agreement with
northrop grumman northrop which purchased litton earlier in 2001 the
settlement amount was included as part of costs of goods sold in december 2001
220 million of the settlement amount was paid to northrop with the remaining
220 million due on or before july 1 2002 the settlement ends the patent
infringement antitrust and other claims that litton originally brought against
the former honeywell and allows us to continue to sell ringlasergyroscope
based products and certain other inertial reference systems free from any claims
from northrop

    shareowner litigation  honeywell and seven of its current and former
officers were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits
filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the
securities law complaints the securities law complaints principally allege
that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly making false
and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information
concerning honeywells financial performance thereby allegedly causing the
value of honeywells stock to be artificially inflated the purported class
period for which damages are sought is december 20 1999 to june 19 2000 on
january 15 2002 the district court dismissed the consolidated complaint
against four of honeywells current and former officers

    in addition honeywell seven of its current and former officers and its
board have been named as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action
which was filed on november 27 2000 in the united states district court for the
district of new jersey the derivative complaint the derivative complaint
alleges a single claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical
allegations to those set forth in the securities law complaints

    we believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the securities law complaints and the derivative complaint although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases we expect to
prevail however an adverse outcome could be material to our consolidated
financial position or results of operations as a result of the uncertainty
regarding the outcome of this matter no provision has been made in our
financial statements with respect to this contingent liability

    environmental matters  we are subject to various federal state and local
government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety
and the environment we believe that as a general matter our policies
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and personal injury to our employees and employees of our
customers and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations however
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies we
like other companies engaged in similar businesses have incurred remedial
response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to
lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters including past
production of products containing toxic substances additional lawsuits claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the
future

    with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination we
continually conduct studies individually at our owned sites and jointly as a
member of industry groups at nonowned sites to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters with respect to
environmental matters involving the production of products containing toxic
substances we believe that the costs of defending and resolving such matters
will be largely covered by insurance subject to deductibles exclusions
retentions and policy limits it is our policy see note 1 to record
appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when environmental assessments
are made or remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated with respect to site contamination the timing of
these accruals is generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies
we expect that we will be able to fund expenditures for these matters from
operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of
factors including the timing of litigation and settlements of personal injury
and property damage claims insurance recoveries regulatory approval of cleanup
projects remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties

    although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies litigation or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations however
considering our past experience insurance coverage and reserves we do not
expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position

    asbestos matters  like more than a thousand other industrial companies
honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos our
involvement is limited because we did not mine or produce asbestos nor did we
make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been
identified as the primary cause of asbestosrelated disease in the vast majority
of claimants rather we made several products that contained small amounts of
asbestos

    honeywells bendix friction materials business manufactured automotive brake
pads that included asbestos in an encapsulated form there is a limited group of
potential claimants consisting largely of professional brake mechanics during
the twentyyear period from 1981 through 2001 we have resolved approximately
53000 bendix claims at an average cost per claim of one thousand dollars
honeywell has had no outofpocket costs for these cases since its insurance
deductible was satisfied many years ago there are currently approximately
47000 claims pending and we have no reason to believe that the historic rate of
dismissal will change we have 2 billion of insurance remaining

    another source of claims is refractory products high temperature bricks and
cement sold largely to the steel industry in the east and midwest by north
american refractories company narco a business we owned from 1979 to 1986
less than 2 percent of narcos products contained asbestos

    when we sold the narco business in 1986 we agreed to indemnify narco with
respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior
to the sale as defined in the sale agreement narco retained all liability for
all other claims narco has resolved approximately

176000 claims in the past 18 years at an average cost per claim of two thousand
two hundred dollars of those claims 43 percent were dismissed on the ground
that there was insufficient evidence that narco was responsible for the
claimants asbestos exposure there are approximately 116000 claims currently
pending against narco including approximately 7 percent in which honeywell is
also named as a defendant during the past 18 years honeywell and our insurers
have contributed to the cost of the narco defense we have in excess of 12
billion of insurance remaining that can be specifically allocated to
narcorelated liability

    on january 4 2002 narco filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the
us bankruptcy code as a result all of the claims pending against narco are
automatically stayed pending the reorganization of narco in addition because
the claims pending against honeywell necessarily will impact the liabilities of
narco because the insurance policies held by honeywell are essential to a
successful narco reorganization and because honeywell has offered to commit
those policies to the reorganization the bankruptcy court has temporarily
enjoined any claims against honeywell current or future related to narco in
connection with narcos bankruptcy filing we paid narcos parent company 40
million and have agreed to provide narco with up to 20 million in financing we
have also agreed to pay 20 million to narcos parent company upon the filing of
a plan of reorganization for narco acceptable to honeywell and to pay narcos
parent company 40 million and to forgive any outstanding narco indebtedness
upon the confirmation and consummation of such a plan

    we believe that as part of the narco plan of reorganization a trust will
be established for the benefit of all asbestos claimants current and future
honeywell intends to contribute its insurance coverage which is in excess of
12 billion to the trust in exchange for its indemnity obligation to narco if
that trust is put in place and approved by the court as fair and equitable
honeywell as well as narco will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction
barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and
requiring all asbestosrelated claims based on exposure to narco products to be
made against the federallysupervised trust in our view our existing insurance
plus the existing narco assets should be sufficient to fund the trust there is
no assurance that a stay will remain in effect that a plan of reorganization
will be proposed or confirmed or that any plan that is confirmed will provide
relief to honeywell

    although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims
or the narco bankruptcy in light of the nature of the potential exposure our
experience over the past 20 years in resolving asbestosrelated claims our
insurance coverage our existing reserves and the narco bankruptcy proceeding
we do not believe that asbestosrelated claims will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

    other matters  we are subject to a number of other lawsuits
investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising
out of the conduct of our business with respect to all these other matters
including those relating to commercial transactions government contracts
product liability and nonenvironmental health and safety matters while the
ultimate results of these lawsuits investigations and claims cannot be
determined we do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

    we have issued or are a party to various direct and indirect guarantees of
the debt of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties of 80 million we do
not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity

    for measurement purposes we assumed an annual healthcare cost trend rate
of 825 percent for covered healthcare benefits in 2002 the rate was assumed to
decrease gradually to 5 percent in 2007 and remain at that level thereafter
assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts

aerospace sales

    our sales to aerospace customers were 40 42 and 42 percent of our total
sales in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively our sales to aerospace original
equipment manufacturers were 14 15 and 16 percent of our total sales in 2000
1999 and 1998 respectively if there were a large decline in sales of aircraft
that use our components operating results could be negatively impacted in
addition our sales to aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services
were 19 19 and 18 percent of our total sales in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively if there were a large decline in the number of flight hours for
aircraft that use our components or services operating results could be
negatively impacted

us government sales

    sales to the us government principally by our aerospace solutions
segment acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime
contractors amounted to 2219 2383 and 2693 million in 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively which includes sales to the us department of defense of
1548 1415 and 1658 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively we are
affected by us government budget constraints for defense and space programs
us defense spending increased slightly in 2000 and is also expected to
increase slightly in 2001

    in addition to normal business risks companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual
risks including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments significant changes in contract scheduling complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete necessity for constant design
improvements intense competition for us government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry
changes are customary over the life of us government contracts particularly
development contracts and generally result in adjustments of contract prices

    we like other government contractors are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty we are not

                                       7





page
currently aware of any such investigations that we expect individually or in
the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on us in addition we have a
proactive business compliance program designed to ensure compliance and sound
business practices

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2000 and 1999 was 8094 and 8736 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 5090 million of the 2000
backlog will be filled in 2001 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option

competition

    we are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas such competition is expected to continue in all geographic
regions competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and
services provided by us and vary country by country depending on the
particular customer or market involved our businesses compete on a variety of
factors such as price quality reliability delivery customer service
performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition
brand identity service to customers and quality are generally important
competitive factors for our products and services and there is considerable
price competition other competitive factors for certain products include
breadth of product line research and development efforts and technical and
managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our products
and services we believe we are a significant factor in each of our major
product and service classes however certain of our products and services are
sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies some of
which have substantial financial resources and significant technological
capabilities in addition some of our products compete with the captive
component divisions of original equipment manufacturers

international operations

    we are engaged in manufacturing sales andor research and development
mainly in the us europe canada asia and latin america us exports and
foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations

    our international operations including us exports are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations including fluctuations in
currency value exchange control regulations wage and price controls
employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions
including embargoes and governmental instability however we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate such risks

    financial information related to geographic areas is included in item 8
financial statements and supplementary data in note 25 of notes to financial
statements

raw materials

    the principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available we experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2000 we are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials however we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers in addition many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties while we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future however at present we have no reason to believe a
shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2001

patents trademarks licenses and distribution rights

    our business as a whole and that of our strategic business units are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents or any licenses or
distribution rights we own or are licensed under a large number of patents
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many

                                       8

years which relate to many of our products or improvements thereon and are of
importance to our business from time to time new patents and trademarks are
obtained and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others
we also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies in the judgment of management such rights
are adequate for the conduct of the business being done by us we believe that
in the aggregate the rights under such patents trademarks and licenses are
generally important to our operations but we do not consider that any patent
trademark or related group of patents or any licensing or distribution rights
related to a specific process or product are of material importance in relation
to our total business see item 3 at page 10 of this form 10k for information
concerning litigation relating to patents in which we are involved

    we have registered trademarks for a number of our products including such
consumer brands as honeywell prestone fram anso and autolite

research and development

    our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes improvements in existing products and processes and
the development of new uses of existing products

    research and development expense totaled 818 909 and 876 million in
2000 1999 and 1998 respectively customersponsored principally the us
government research and development activities amounted to an additional 560
682 and 718 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

environment

    we are subject to various federal state and local requirements regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment it is our policy to comply with these
requirements and we believe that as a general matter our policies practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with
our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in certain
of our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses

    we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use or disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies we believe that as a general matter our handling manufacture use
and disposal of such substances are in accord with environmental laws and
regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other
developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies thereunder could bring into question our handling
manufacture use or disposal of such substances

    among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal
superfund law and similar state laws under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites some of which are on the us environmental
protection agencys superfund priority list although under some court
interpretations of these laws there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi
party situations taken as a whole

operations

    total segment profit in 2000 was 3629 million an increase of 358
million or 11 percent compared with 1999 segment profit margin for 2000 was
145 percent compared with 138 percent in 1999 the increase in segment profit
in 2000 was led by a significant improvement by the aerospace solutions and
automation  control segments and lower corporate expenses the increase was
partially offset by lower segment profit by the performance materials and power
 transportation products segments total segment profit in 1999 was
3271 million an increase of 359 million or 12 percent compared with 1998
segment profit margin for 1999 was 138 percent compared with 124 percent in
1998 the increase in segment profit in 1999 was led by a substantial
improvement by the aerospace solutions segment with the power  transportation
products and automation  control segments also contributing solid gains lower
corporate expenses also contributed to the increase the increase was partially
offset by a substantial decrease in segment profit by the performance materials
segment

    postretirement benefit plans contributed cost reductions of 282 and 61
million in 2000 and 1999 respectively principally due to workforce reductions
and the funding status of our pension plans described in item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 23 of notes to financial statements
future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment
performance

found in the review of business segments section below

    gain on sale of nonstrategic businesses of 112 million in 2000
represents the pretax gain on the governmentmandated divestiture of the tcas
product line of honeywell inc the former honeywell following the merger of
alliedsignal inc and honeywell inc in december 1999 gain on sale of
nonstrategic businesses of 106 million in 1999 represents the pretax gain on
the sale of our laminate systems business refer to item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 6 of notes to financial statements
for further information

    equity in income loss of affiliated companies was a loss of 89 million in
2000 compared with income of 76 million in 1999 the decrease of 165 million
in equity income reflects that the current year includes a charge of
136 million for costs associated with closing an affiliates chemical
manufacturing operations and for an equity investees customer claims the prior
year also included a charge of 40 million related to the writedown of an equity
investment and an equity investees severance actions refer to item 8
financial statements and supplementary data in note 5 of notes to financial
statements for further discussion of the charges in both 2000 and 1999
excluding these charges in both periods equity in income loss of affiliated
companies was income of 47 million in 2000 a decrease of 69 million compared
with 1999 this decrease was due mainly to lower earnings from our uop process
technology uop joint venture partially offset by the gain on the sale of our
interest in an automotive aftermarket joint venture equity in income loss of
affiliated companies was income of 76 million in 1999 compared with income of
162 million in 1998 the decrease of 86 million resulted from the charge of
40 million relating to the writedown of an equity investment and an equity
investees severance actions as well as lower earnings from uop

    other income expense 57 million of income in 2000 decreased by
250 million compared with 1999 the decrease principally reflects the 1999 net
gain of 268 million on our disposition of our investment in amp incorporated
amp common stock refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary
data in note 7 of notes to financial statements for further information
excluding this net gain other income expense was 57 million of income in
2000 compared with 39 million of income in 1999 this increase in other income
of 18 million in 2000 was due principally to lower minority interest expense
and increased benefits from foreign exchange hedging other income expense
307 million of income in 1999 increased by 280 million compared with 1998
the increase principally reflects the net gain of 268 million on our
disposition of our investment in amp common stock

    interest and other financial charges of 481 million in 2000 increased by
216 million or 82 percent compared with 1999 the increase results from higher
average levels of debt during the current year due principally to the pittway
acquisition and our share repurchase program higher average interest rates and
the impact of tax interest expense interest and other financial charges of
265 million in 1999 decreased by 10 million or 4 percent compared with 1998
the decrease resulted from lower interest rates and tax interest expense
somewhat offset by the effects of higher average debt outstanding during 1999

review of business segments

    aerospace solutions sales in 2000 were 9988 million an increase of 80
million or 1 percent compared with 1999 higher sales to the aftermarket
particularly repair and overhaul and the military and increased original
equipment sales to business regional and general aviation customers were
partially offset by lower original equipment sales to air transport
manufacturers and a decline in engineering services revenues sales also
decreased due to the effects of governmentmandated divestitures in connection
with the merger of alliedsignal and the former honeywell aerospace solutions
sales in 1999 were 9908 million or basically flat compared with 1998 sales of
avionics products were higher due principally to continued strong demand for
flight safety products sales to the aftermarket particularly repair and
overhaul and the military were also higher the acquisition in 1998 of a
controlling interest in the normalairgarrett ltd environmental controls joint
venture also increased sales this increase was offset by lower sales to air
transport and military original equipment manufacturers and the effects of
divestitures and a restructuring of a government technical services contract

    aerospace solutions segment profit in 2000 was 2195 million an increase
of 277 million or 14 percent compared with 1999 due principally to cost
structure improvements primarily from workforce and benefit cost reductions
and mergerrelated savings increased sales of highermargin aftermarket
products and services also contributed to the improvement in segment profit
aerospace solutions segment profit in 1999 was 1918 million an increase of
331 million or 21 percent compared with 1998 due principally to increased
sales of highermargin aftermarket and avionics products and cost structure
improvements primarily from workforce and benefit cost reductions

    automation  control sales in 2000 were 7384 million an increase of
1269 million or 21 percent compared with 1999 sales for our home and
building control business were substantially higher as increased sales in our
security products business due to the acquisition of pittway were partially
offset by lower sales in our solutions and services business sales for our
industrial control business declined moderately as growth in our sensing and
control business was more than offset by lower sales in our industrial
automation and control business our industrial automation and control business
continues to be adversely affected by weakness in the hydrocarbon processing
industry sales for the segment were also adversely impacted by foreign currency
fluctuations due to the strong dollar automation  control sales in 1999 were
6115 million an increase of 158 million or 3 percent compared with 1998
sales increased for our home and building control business driven by growth in
our control products and building services and security businesses
acquisitions also contributed to the increase partially offset by lower sales
from our energy retrofit and installed systems businesses sales for our
industrial control business were basically flat compared with 1998 higher sales
due to acquisitions and growth in our sensing and control business were offset
by the effects of continued weakness in our industrial automation and control
business

    automation  control segment profit in 2000 was 986 million an increase of
219 million or 29 percent compared with 1999 segment profit for both our home
and building control and industrial control businesses improved primarily as a
result of lower costs due to workforce and benefit cost reductions and
mergerrelated savings the acquisition of pittway and other portfolio changes
also contributed to the improvement in segment profit automation  control
segment profit in 1999 was 767 million an increase of 62 million or 9
percent compared with 1998 segment profit for our home and building control
business increased significantly due to improvement in our control products
business and the contraction of our lowermargin energy retrofit and installed
systems businesses cost savings from workforce reductions also contributed to
the improvement this increase was offset somewhat by lower segment profit for
our industrial control business as growth in our highermargin sensing and
control business and cost structure improvements were more than offset by the
effects of continued weakness in certain key end markets in our industrial
automation and control business

    performance materials sales in 2000 were 4055 million an increase of 48
million or 1 percent compared with 1999 higher sales of advanced circuitry and
waferfabrication products by our

electronic materials business were largely offset by the effect of divestitures
principally our laminate systems business performance materials sales in 1999
were 4007 million a decrease of 162 million or 4 percent compared with 1998
due principally to divestitures including our environmental catalyst laminate
systems and phenol businesses lower sales for our carpet fibers business also
contributed to the decrease this decrease was partially offset by higher sales
for our specialty films engineering plastics and waxes businesses and increased
sales from the acquisitions of johnson matthey electronics and pharmaceutical
fine chemicals

    performance materials segment profit in 2000 was 334 million a decrease of
105 million or 24 percent compared with 1999 the decrease principally
reflects higher raw material costs in certain performance polymers and chemicals
businesses and higher operating losses in our chip packaging and pharmaceutical
chemicals businesses the decrease was partially offset by cost structure
improvements and price increases in certain performance polymers and chemicals
businesses performance materials segment profit in 1999 was 439 million a
decrease of 195 million or 31 percent compared with 1998 the decrease
principally reflects the effects of pricing pressures in our performance
polymers and electronic materials businesses and higher raw material costs in
certain performance polymers businesses the impact of 1998 divestitures also
contributed to the decrease the effect of improved sales volume for our
specialty films engineering plastics and waxes businesses was a partial offset

    power  transportation products sales in 2000 were 3527 million a
decrease of 54 million or 2 percent compared with 1999 due mainly to lower
sales for our commercial vehicle systems and friction materials businesses
sales for our commercial vehicles systems business were negatively impacted by
decreased heavyduty truck builds sales for our friction materials business
were lower mainly due to foreign currency fluctuations this decrease was
partially offset by higher sales for our turbocharging systems business as
continued strong worldwide demand more than offset the adverse impact of
foreign currency fluctuations power  transportation products sales in 1999
were 3581 million an increase of 194 million or 6 percent compared with
1998 sales for our turbocharging systems business increased significantly due
primarily to continued strong sales in europe reflecting the turbodiesels
increased penetration of the passenger car market sales for our commercial
vehicle systems business also increased due principally to increased north
american truck builds sales for our consumer products group business also
increased led by higher sales of prestoner products and framr filters
lower sales for our friction materials business due to pricing pressures
weakness in the european market and foreign currency fluctuations were a partial
offset

    power  transportation products segment profit in 2000 was 274 million a
decrease of 48 million or 15 percent compared with 1999 the decrease
primarily reflects costs associated with a product recall and lower sales in our
commercial vehicle systems business costs related to the rampup of our
turbogenerator product line and costs associated with a supplier issue in our
turbocharging systems business the decrease was partially offset by the effects
of cost structure improvements in our friction materials and consumer products
group businesses and higher sales in our turbocharging systems business power 
transportation products segment profit in 1999 was 322 million an increase of
88 million or 38 percent compared with 1998 the increase reflects higher
sales for our turbocharging systems commercial vehicle systems and consumer
products group businesses cost structure improvements in these businesses
materials procurement savings and workforce reductions also contributed to the
increase

in amp and lower proceeds from sales of businesses were principally responsible
for the increase this increase was partially offset by lower capital spending
cash used for investing activities of 291 million during 1999 decreased by
1302 million compared with 1998 the decrease relates principally to the
proceeds from our disposition of our investment in amp and an increase in
proceeds from sales of businesses primarily laminate systems this decrease was
partially offset by higher spending for acquisitions mainly johnson matthey
electronics and the liquidation in 1998 of shortterm investments

    we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our
portfolio as to strategic fit market position and profit contribution in order
to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify operating units that will most
benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition candidates that will
further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses we also
identify operating units that do not fit into our longterm strategic plan based
on their market position relative profitability or growth potential these
operating units are considered for potential divestiture restructuring or other
repositioning action subject to regulatory constraints

    capital expenditures were 853 986 and 1037 million in 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively spending by the reportable segments and corporate since 1998
is shown in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 24 of
notes to financial statements our total capital expenditures in 2001 are
currently projected at approximately 1 billion these expenditures are expected
to be financed principally by internally generated funds and are primarily
planned for expansion and cost reduction

    cash used for financing activities of 70 million during 2000 decreased by
1040 million compared with 1999 led principally by a decrease in stock
repurchases and higher net issuances of debt during 2000 we repurchased 43
million shares of our common stock for 166 million in connection with our share
repurchase program as a result of the pending merger with general electric see
item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 4 of notes to
financial statements honeywell rescinded its share repurchase program
effective october 21 2000 total debt of 5623 million at december 31 2000
was 557 million or 11 percent higher than at december 31 1999 due to the
acquisition of pittway cash used for financing activities of 1110 million
during 1999 increased by 1002 million compared with 1998 the increase relates
principally to lower net issuances of debt partially offset by lower net stock
repurchases total debt of 5066 million at yearend 1999 was 100 million or
2 percent higher than at december 31 1998

    we maintain a 2 billion bank revolving credit facility which is comprised
of a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and b a 1 billion 364day
credit agreement the credit agreements were established for general corporate
purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper there was
1192 and 2023 million of commercial paper outstanding at yearend 2000 and
1999 respectively see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in
note 16 of notes to financial statements for details of longterm debt and a
discussion of the credit agreements

    we believe that our available cash committed credit lines and access to
the public debt markets using debt securities and commercial paper provide
adequate shortterm and longterm liquidity

merger and repositioning charges

    in 2000 we recognized a charge of 239 million related to announced global
workforce reductions in each of our reportable segments costs to close a chip
package manufacturing plant and related workforce reductions in our electronic
materials business and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shutdowns in our performance polymers
and chemicals business the components of the charge included severance costs of
151 million and asset impairments of 88 million the workforce reductions
consisted of approximately 2800 manufacturing and administrative positions and
are expected to be substantially completed by

                                       16

the end of the second quarter of 2001 asset impairments were principally
related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and capable of being
taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of impairment also
46 million of accruals established in 1999 principally for severance were
returned to income in 2000 due to higher than expected voluntary employee
attrition approximately 650 positions resulting in reduced severance
liabilities principally in our automation  control and aerospace solutions
reportable segments we also recognized a charge of 99 million in equity in
income loss of affiliated companies for costs to close an affiliates chemical
manufacturing operations the components of the charge included severance costs
of 6 million asset impairments of 53 million and other environmental exit
costs and period expenses of 40 million

    in 1999 upon completion of the merger between alliedsignal and the former
honeywell we recognized a charge of 642 million for the cost of actions
designed to improve our combined competitiveness productivity and future
profitability the mergerrelated actions included the elimination of redundant
corporate offices and functional administrative overhead elimination of
redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses adoption of six sigma productivity initiatives at the former
honeywell businesses and the transition to a global shared services model the
components of the charge included severance costs of 342 million asset
impairments of 108 million other exit costs of 57 million and mergerrelated
transaction and period expenses of 135 million planned global workforce
reductions consisted of approximately 6500 administrative and manufacturing
positions and are substantially complete asset impairments were principally
related to the elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace
facilities and equipment other exit costs were related to lease terminations
and contract cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation
at yearend mergerrelated transaction and period expenses consisted of
investment banking and legal fees former honeywell deferred compensation vested
upon change in control and other direct mergerrelated expenses incurred in the
period the merger was completed all mergerrelated actions are substantially
complete

    in 1999 we also recognized a pretax charge of 321 million for the costs of
actions designed to reposition principally the alliedsignal businesses for
improved productivity and future profitability these repositioning actions
included the organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to
strengthen market focus and simplify business structure elimination of an
unprofitable product line closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant
and rationalization of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our
performance polymers and chemicals business a reduction in the infrastructure
in our turbocharging systems business elimination of two manufacturing
facilities in our electronic materials business a plant closure and outsourcing
activity in our automotive consumer products group business and related and
general workforce reductions in all alliedsignal businesses and our industrial
control business the components of the charge included severance costs of
140 million asset impairments of 149 million and other exit costs of
32 million global workforce reductions consisted of approximately 5100
manufacturing administrative and sales positions and are substantially
complete asset impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant and
equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively
marketed in the period of impairment other exit costs principally consisted of
environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant shutdowns all
repositioning actions excluding environmental remediation are substantially
complete

    the merger and repositioning actions committed to in 2000 and 1999 generated
pretax savings of over 270 million in 2000 principally from planned workforce
reductions and facility consolidations we expect these actions to generate
pretax savings of over 600 million in 2001 and 780 million in 2002 cash
expenditures for severance other exit costs and future period expenses
necessary to execute these actions will exceed 500 million and were
principally incurred in 2000 such expenditures have been funded through
operating cash flows proceeds from government required divestitures resulting
from the merger of alliedsignal and the former honeywell and sale of merger
related excess or duplicate facilities and equipment

    we are currently formulating a detailed plan to effect further actions
designed to improve our competitiveness productivity and future profitability
the cost of these actions will result in a charge against earnings in the first
quarter of 2001

                                       17

    in 1998 we recognized a charge of 54 million related to productivity
initiatives which included workforce reductions of 1200 employees and facility
consolidations principally in our home and building control and industrial
control businesses these actions were completed by december 31 1999 with
substantially all reserve spending occurring in 1999

environmental matters

    we are subject to various federal state and local government requirements
relating to the protection of the environment we believe that as a general
matter our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent
unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that our handling manufacture
use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations however mainly because of past operations
and operations of predecessor companies we like other companies engaged in
similar businesses are a party to lawsuits and claims and have incurred
remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental
matters additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters
are likely to continue to arise in the future we continually conduct studies
individually at our owned sites and jointly as a member of industry groups at
nonowned sites to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to
address environmental matters it is our policy to record appropriate
liabilities for such matters when environmental assessments are made or remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated the timing of
these accruals is generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies

    remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were 75 78 and 77
million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively and are currently estimated to be
approximately 69 million in 2001 we expect that we will be able to fund such
expenditures from operating cash flow the timing of expenditures depends on a
number of factors including regulatory approval of cleanup projects remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties

    in 2000 we charged 110 million against pretax income for remedial response
and voluntary cleanup costs at december 31 2000 and 1999 the recorded
liability for environmental matters was 386 and 349 million respectively
in addition in 2000 and 1999 we incurred operating costs for ongoing
businesses of approximately 80 and 89 million respectively relating
to compliance with environmental regulations

    although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies or settlements and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate
costs associated with environmental matters can be determined they may be
significant to our consolidated results of operations we do not expect that
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position

    see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in note 22 of
notes to financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and
contingencies including those related to environmental matters

financial instruments

    as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates
which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we
minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed
appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments a summary of our
accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in item 8
financial statements and supplementary data in note 1 of notes to financial
statements

    our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our debt obligations as described in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data in notes 16 and 18 of notes

                                       18





page
to financial statements we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use
interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce
borrowing costs

    our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates
arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries and foreign
currency denominated receivables payables and firm commitments arising from
international transactions we attempt to have such transaction exposures hedged
with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these
opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option
agreements with third parties we also use derivative financial instruments to
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on the translated us dollar value
of the net income for a number of foreign subsidiaries foreign currency forward
and option agreements used to hedge net income are markedtomarket with gains
or losses recognized immediately in income our principal foreign currency
exposures relate to the belgian franc the french franc the german mark
collectively the euro countries the british pound the canadian dollar and
the us dollar at december 31 2000 we held or had written foreign currency
forward and option agreements maturing through 2001

    derivative financial instruments expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency
exchange rates we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific
minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and procedures to
monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are substantial
investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such
derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value
and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering
reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict
the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities

    the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for
interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate
onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates across all maturities and the
potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments
based on a 10 percent increase in us dollar per local currency exchange rates
across all maturities at december 31 2000 and 1999

forwardlooking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market
conditions occur actual results in the future may differ materially from these
estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

other matters

litigation

    litton litigation  on march 13 1990 litton systems inc filed a legal
action against the former honeywell in us district court central district of
california los angeles with claims that were subsequently split into two
separate cases one alleges patent infringement under federal law for using an
ionbeam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the former honeywells ring
laser gyroscopes and tortious interference under state law for interfering with
littons prospective advantage with customers and contractual relationships with
an inventor and his company ojai research inc the other case alleges
monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal antitrust laws by the
former honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems containing ring laser
gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market the former honeywell generally
denied littons allegations in both cases in the patenttort case the former
honeywell also contested the validity as well as the infringement of the patent
alleging among other things that the patent had been obtained by littons
inequitable conduct before the united states patent and trademark office

    in 1993 and 1995 trials were held in each case and juries initially awarded
litton significant monetary damages however those verdicts were set aside by
the trial court judge who ordered at a minimum new trials on the issue of
damages in each case

    following crossappeals by the parties of various issues to the federal
circuit and the us supreme court in the patenttort case it was remanded to
the trial court for further legal and perhaps factual review with respect to
both liability and damages on september 23 1999 the trial court issued
dispositive rulings in the case granting the former honeywells motion for
judgment as a matter of law and summary judgment on the patent claims on various
grounds granting the former honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law
on the state law claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence and denying
littons motion for partial summary judgment the trial court entered a final
judgment in honeywells favor on january 31 2000 and litton appealed that
judgment to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on february 5
2001 a three judge panel of the federal circuit court affirmed the trial
courts rulings granting the former honeywells motion for judgment as a matter
of law and summary judgment on the patent claims agreeing that the former
honeywell did not infringe on the state law claims the panel vacated the
jurys verdict in favor of litton reversed the trial courts grant of judgment
as a matter of law for the former honeywell and remanded the case to the trial
court for further proceedings under state law to resolve certain factual issues
that it held should have been submitted to the jury litton may now seek review
of this decision by the us supreme court

    a retrial of damages in the antitrust case commenced october 29 1998 and
on december 9 1998 a jury returned a verdict against honeywell for actual
damages in the amount of 250 million following post trial motions on
september 24 1999 the trial court issued rulings denying the former
honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial and
remittitur as they related to litton systems inc but granting the former
honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law as it relates to litton
systems canada limited the net effect of these rulings was to reduce the
existing judgment against the former honeywell of 750 million to 660 million
plus attorney fees and costs of approximately 35 million we believe that there
is no factual or legal basis for the magnitude of the jurys award and believe
that it should be overturned we also believe we have very strong arguments that
the liability portion of the jury verdict in the first antitrust trial was
erroneous both parties have appealed this judgment as to both liability and
damages to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit execution of the
trial courts judgment is stayed pending resolution of the former honeywells
postjudgment motions and disposition of any appeals filed by the parties

    although it is not possible at this time to predict the result of any
further appeals in this case potential does remain for an adverse outcome which
could be material to our financial position or results of operations as a
result of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter no provision has
been made in the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability

    for a detailed discussion of this litigation see item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in note 22 of notes to the financial
statements

    shareowner litigation  honeywell and seven of its officers were named as
defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states
district court for the district of new jersey

                                       20

the securities law complaints the securities law complaints principally
allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly
making false and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material
information concerning honeywells financial performance thereby allegedly
causing the value of honeywells stock to be artificially inflated the
purported class period for which damages are sought is december 20 1999 to
june 19 2000

    in addition honeywell seven of its officers and its board of directors
have been named as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action which
was filed on november 27 2000 in the united states district court for the
district of new jersey the derivative complaint the derivative compliant
alleges a single claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical
allegations to those set forth in the securities law complaints

    we believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the securities law complaints and the derivative complaint although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases we expect to
prevail however an adverse outcome could be material to our financial position
or results of operations no provision has been made in our financial statements
with respect to this contingent liability

euro conversion

    on january 1 1999 certain member countries of the european union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
european unions common currency euro the transition period for the
introduction of the euro is between january 1 1999 and january 1 2002 we have
identified and are ensuring that all euro conversion compliance issues are
addressed and do not expect any adverse consequences

sales to the us government

    sales to the us government acting through its various departments and
agencies and through prime contractors amounted to 2219 2383 and
2693 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively this included sales to the
department of defense dod as a prime contractor and subcontractor of 1548
1415 and 1658 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively sales to the dod
accounted for 62 60 and 70 percent of our total sales in 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively we are affected by us government budget constraints for
defense and space programs us defense spending increased slightly in 2000 and
is also expected to increase slightly in 2001

backlog

    our total backlog at yearend 2000 and 1999 was 8094 and 8736 million
respectively we anticipate that approximately 5090 million of the 2000
backlog will be filled in 2001 we believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option

inflation

    highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflations impact on
the selling prices of our products and the cost of our purchased materials cost
increases for materials and labor have generally been low and productivity
enhancement programs including six sigma initiatives have largely offset any
impact

new accounting pronouncement

    statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas no 133 is
effective for honeywell as of january 1 2001 sfas no 133 requires all
derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities
measured at fair value the accounting for gains or losses resulting from
changes in values of such derivatives depends on the use of the derivative and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting we estimate that at january 1 2001
the effect on our consolidated financial statements of adopting sfas no 133
will not be material

note 1  summary of significant accounting policies

    honeywell international inc is a diversified technology and manufacturing
company serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services
control technologies for buildings homes and industry automotive products
power generation systems specialty chemicals fibers plastics and electronic
and advanced materials as described in note 2 honeywell international inc was
formed upon the merger of alliedsignal inc and honeywell inc the following is
a description of the significant accounting policies of honeywell international
inc

    principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of honeywell international inc and all of its subsidiaries in
which a controlling interest is maintained all intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation

    inventories  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using
the firstin firstout or the average cost method and the lastin firstout
lifo method for certain qualifying domestic inventories

    investments  investments in affiliates over which we have a significant
influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting other investments are carried at market value if readily
determinable or cost

    property plant and equipment  property plant and equipment are recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation for financial reporting the
straightline method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of
10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery
and equipment

    goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill represents the excess of
acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and
is amortized on a straightline basis over appropriate periods up to 40 years
goodwill net was 5600 and 4282 million at december 31 2000 and 1999
respectively accumulated amortization was 974 and 804 million at
december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively

    other intangible assets includes patents trademarks customer lists and
other items amortized on a straightline basis over appropriate periods up to
24 years other intangible assets net were 298 and 378 million at
december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively accumulated amortization was 437 and
398 million at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively

    longlived assets  we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the
carrying amount of longlived assets including property plant and equipment
goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we also
continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all longlived assets and
periodically revise such estimates based on current events

    sales recognition  product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
assured sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace solutions and
automation  control segments are recorded on a percentageofcompletion method
measured on the costtocost basis for engineeringtype contracts and the
unitsofdelivery basis for productiontype contracts provisions for
anticipated losses on longterm contracts are recorded in full when such losses
become evident

    environmental expenditures  environmental expenditures that relate to
current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
provide future benefits are expensed as incurred liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the
costs

                 dollars in millions except per share amounts

can be reasonably estimated the timing of these accruals is generally no later
than the completion of feasibility studies

    foreign currency translation  assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the united states with a functional currency other than us
dollars are translated into us dollars using yearend exchange rates sales
costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates effective during
the year foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of accumulated other nonowner changes in shareowners equity for
subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments inventories and
property plant and equipment including related expenses are remeasured at the
exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired while monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement
adjustments for these operations are included in net income

    financial instruments  interest rate swap foreign currency forward and
option agreements are accounted for as a hedge of the related asset liability
firm commitment or anticipated transaction when designated and effective as a
hedge of such items agreements qualifying for hedge accounting are accounted
for as follows

     changes in the amount to be received or paid under interest rate swap
     agreements are recognized in interest and other financial charges

     gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge
     assets liabilities and net income are recognized in other income
     expense

     gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge net
     investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative
     foreign exchange translation adjustment

     gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge firm
     foreign currency commitments and purchased foreign currency options used
     to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions are recognized in the
     measurement of the hedged transaction when the transaction occurs

    changes in the fair value of agreements not qualifying for hedge accounting
are recognized in other income expense gains and losses on terminated
interest rate swap agreements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining
term of the agreement or the hedged liability

    the carrying value of each agreement is reported in accounts and notes
receivable other current assets accounts payable or accrued liabilities as
appropriate

    income taxes  deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary
differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax
reporting such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax
rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a
valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which
realization is not likely

    research and development  research and development costs for
companysponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred
such costs are classified as part of cost of goods sold and were 818 909 and
876 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

    earnings per share  basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings per share is based
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding all earnings per share data in this report
reflect earnings per share  assuming dilution unless otherwise indicated

    cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand
and on deposit and highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less

    use of estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions

that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related
disclosures in the accompanying notes actual results could differ from those
estimates

    new accounting pronouncement  statement of financial accounting standards
no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
amended sfas no 133 is effective for honeywell as of january 1 2001 sfas
no 133 requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets
or liabilities measured at fair value the accounting for gains or losses
resulting from changes in values of such derivatives depends on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting we estimate that at
january 1 2001 the effect on our consolidated financial statements of adopting
sfas no 133 will not be material

note 2  alliedsignal  honeywell merger

    on december 1 1999 alliedsignal inc alliedsignal and honeywell inc
former honeywell completed a merger under an agreement and plan of merger
merger agreement dated as of june 4 1999 under the merger agreement a
whollyowned subsidiary of alliedsignal merged with and into the former
honeywell as a result of the merger the former honeywell has become a
whollyowned subsidiary of alliedsignal at the effective time of the merger
alliedsignal was renamed honeywell international inc honeywell

    the former honeywell shareowners received 1875 shares of honeywell common
stock for each share of the former honeywell common stock with cash paid in lieu
of any fractional shares as a result former honeywell shareowners received
approximately 241 million shares of honeywell common stock valued at
approximately 15 billion at the merger date in addition outstanding former
honeywell employee stock options were converted at the same exchange factor into
options to purchase approximately 10 million shares of honeywell common stock

    the merger qualified as a taxfree reorganization and was accounted for
under the poolingofinterests accounting method accordingly honeywells
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to
the merger to include the results of operations financial position and cash
flows of the former honeywell as though it had always been a part of honeywell

    there were no material transactions between alliedsignal and the former
honeywell prior to the merger and there were no material adjustments to conform
the accounting policies of the combining companies

    the net sales and net income previously reported by the separate companies
and the combined amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of
income are as follows

    all the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of
acquisition the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
net assets acquired of 1678 678 and 883 million in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively was recorded as goodwill and is amortized over estimated useful
lives in connection with these acquisitions the amounts recorded for
transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into
honeywell were not material the results of operations of the acquired
businesses have been included in the consolidated results of honeywell from
their respective acquisition dates the pro forma results for 2000 1999 and
1998 assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year
would not be materially different from reported results

151 million and asset impairments of 88 million the workforce reductions
consisted of approximately 2800 manufacturing and administrative positions and
are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of

equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively
marketed in the period of impairment also 46 million of accruals established
in 1999 principally for severance were returned to income in 2000 due to
higher than expected voluntary employee attrition approximately 650 positions
resulting in reduced severance liabilities principally in our automation 
control and aerospace solutions reportable segments we also recognized a charge

investment banking and legal fees former honeywell deferred compensation vested
upon change in control and other direct mergerrelated expenses incurred in the
period the merger was completed all mergerrelated actions are substantially
complete

    in 1999 we also recognized a charge of 321 million for the cost of actions
designed to reposition principally the alliedsignal businesses for improved
productivity and future profitability these repositioning actions included the
organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to strengthen market
focus and simplify business structure elimination of an unprofitable product
line closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant and rationalization
of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our performance polymers and
chemicals business a reduction in the infrastructure in our turbocharging
systems business elimination of two manufacturing facilities in our electronic
materials business a plant closure and outsourcing activity in our automotive
consumer products group business and related and general workforce reductions
in all alliedsignal businesses and our industrial control business the

    the amount of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards available at
december 31 2000 was 111 million the majority of these loss carryforwards
were generated by certain subsidiaries prior to their acquisition in 1997 and
have expiration dates through the year 2011 the use of preacquisition
operating losses is subject to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code
we do not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the
carryforwards prior to their expiration we also have foreign net operating
losses of 595 million which are available to reduce future income tax payments
in several countries subject to varying expiration rules

    we maintain 2 billion of bank revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks which are comprised of a a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement and
b a 1 billion 364day credit agreement the credit agreements are maintained
for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial
paper we had no balance outstanding under either agreement at december 31
2000

    neither of the credit agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends and
neither contain financial covenants the failure to comply with customary
conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the
credit agreements would prevent any further borrowings and would generally
require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under such credit
agreements such events of default include a nonpayment of credit agreement
debt and interest thereon b noncompliance with the terms of the credit
agreement covenants c crossdefault with other debt in certain circumstances
d bankruptcy and e defaults upon obligations under the employee retirement
income security act additionally each of the banks has the right to terminate
its commitment to lend under the credit agreements if any person or group
acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock or
during any 12month period individuals who were directors of honeywell at the
beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors

note 18  financial instruments

    as a result of our global operating and financing activities we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates
which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position we
minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
through our normal operating and financing activities and when deemed
appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments

    interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk by
adjusting our ratio of fixed to floating interest rates payable on our
outstanding debt at december 31 2000 and 1999 interest rate swap agreements
effectively changed 1600 and 850 million respectively of fixed rate debt at
an average rate of 71 and 66 percent respectively to libor and commercial
paper based floating rate debt other interest rate swaps at december 31 1999
effectively changed 250 million of libor and commercial paper based floating
rate swaps and debt to fixed rate swaps and debt with an average fixed rate of
63 percent our interest rate swaps mature through the year 2007

    our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates
arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries and foreign
currency denominated receivables payables and firm commitments arising from
international transactions we attempt to have such transaction exposure hedged
with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these
opportunities have been exhausted through foreign currency forward and option
agreements with third parties we also use derivative financial instruments to
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on the translated us dollar value
of the net income for a number of foreign subsidiaries foreign currency forward
and option agreements used to hedge net income are markedtomarket with gains
or losses recognized immediately in income our principal foreign currency
exposures relate to the belgian franc the french franc the german mark
collectively the euro countries the british pound the canadian dollar and
the us dollar at december 31 2000 we held or had written foreign currency
forward and option agreements maturing through 2001

    derivative financial instruments expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency
exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through
specific minimum credit standards diversification of counterparties and
procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk our counterparties are
substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using
such derivative instruments we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities

december 31 2000 and 1999 follows

federal law for using an ionbeam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the
former honeywells ring laser gyroscopes and tortious interference under state
law for interfering with littons prospective advantage with customers and
contractual relationships with an inventor and his company ojai research inc
the other case alleges monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal
antitrust laws by the former honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems
containing ring laser gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market the former
honeywell generally denied littons allegations in both cases in the
patenttort case the former honeywell also contested the validity as well as
the infringement of the patent alleging among other things that the patent
had been obtained by littons inequitable conduct before the united states
patent and trademark office

    patenttort case  us district court judge mariana pfaelzer presided over
a threemonth patent infringement and tortious interference trial in 1993 on
august 31 1993 a jury returned a verdict in favor of litton awarding damages
against the former honeywell in the amount of 12 billion on three claims the
former honeywell filed posttrial motions contesting the verdict and damage
award on january 9 1995 the trial court set them all aside ruling among
other things that the litton patent was invalid due to obviousness
unenforceable because of littons inequitable conduct before the patent and
trademark office and in any case not infringed by the former honeywells
current process it further ruled that littons state tort claims were not
supported by sufficient evidence the trial court also held that if its rulings
concerning liability were vacated or reversed on appeal the former honeywell
should at least be granted a new trial on the issue of damages because the
jurys award was inconsistent with the clear weight of the evidence and based
upon a speculative damage study

    the trial courts rulings were appealed to the us court of appeals for the
federal circuit and on july 3 1996 in a two to one split decision a three
judge panel of that court reversed the trial courts rulings of patent
invalidity unenforceability and noninfringement and also found the former
honeywell to have violated california law by intentionally interfering with
littons consultant contracts and customer prospects however the panel upheld
two trial court rulings favorable to the former honeywell namely that the
former honeywell was entitled to a new trial for damages on all claims and also
to a grant of intervening patent rights which are to be defined and quantified
by the trial court after unsuccessfully requesting a rehearing of the panels
decision by the full federal circuit appellate court the former honeywell filed
a petition with the us supreme court on november 26 1996 seeking review of
the panels decision in the interim litton filed a motion and briefs with the
trial court seeking injunctive relief against the former honeywells commercial
ring laser gyroscope sales after the former honeywell and certain aircraft
manufacturers filed briefs and made oral arguments opposing the injunction the
trial court denied littons motion on public interest grounds on december 23
1996 and then scheduled the patenttort damages retrial for may 6 1997

    on march 17 1997 the us supreme court granted the former honeywells
petition for review and vacated the july 3 1996 federal circuit panel decision
the case was remanded to the federal circuit panel for reconsideration in light
of a recent decision by the us supreme court in the warnerjenkinson vs
hilton davis case which refined the law concerning patent infringement under
the doctrine of equivalents on march 21 1997 litton filed a notice of appeal
to the federal circuit of the trial courts december 23 1996 decision to deny
injunctive relief but the federal circuit stayed any briefing or consideration
of that matter until such time as it completed its reconsideration of liability
issues ordered by the us supreme court

    the liability issues were argued before the same three judge federal circuit
panel on september 30 1997 on april 7 1998 the panel issued its decision

    i  affirming the trial courts ruling that the former honeywells hollow
         cathode and rf ionbeam processes do not literally infringe the
         asserted claims of littons 849 reissue patent littons patent

   ii  vacating the trial courts ruling that the former honeywells rf
         ionbeam process does not infringe the asserted claims of littons

         warnerjenkinson decision

         cathode process infringes the asserted claims of littons patent
         under the doctrine of equivalents and remanding that issue to the

         intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional
         interference with prospective economic advantage but also vacating the
         jurys verdict on that issue and remanding the issue to the trial
         court for further proceedings in accordance with california state law

    v  affirming the trial courts grant of a new trial to the former
         honeywell on damages for all claims if necessary

    vi affirming the trial courts order granting intervening rights to the
         former honeywell in the patent claim

   vii reversing the trial courts ruling that the asserted claims of
         littons patent were invalid due to obviousness and reinstating the
         jurys verdict on that issue and

  viii reversing the trial courts determination that litton had obtained
         littons patent through inequitable conduct

    littons request for a rehearing of the panels decision by the full federal
circuit court was denied and its appeal of the denial of an injunction was
dismissed the case was remanded to the trial court for further legal and
perhaps factual review the parties filed motions with the trial court to
dispose of the remanded issues as matters of law which were argued before the
trial court on july 26 1999 on september 23 1999 the trial court issued
dispositive rulings in the case granting the former honeywells motion for
judgment as a matter of law and summary judgment on the patent claims on various
grounds granting the former honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law
on the state law claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence and denying
littons motion for partial summary judgment the trial court entered a final
judgment in honeywells favor on january 31 2000 and litton appealed that
judgment to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit

    on february 5 2001 a three judge panel of the federal circuit court
affirmed the trial courts rulings granting the former honeywells motion for
judgment as a matter of law and summary judgment on the patent claims agreeing
that the former honeywell did not infringe on the state law claims the panel
vacated the jurys verdict in favor of litton reversed the trial courts grant
of judgment as a matter of law for the former honeywell and remanded the case
to the trial court for further proceedings under state law to resolve certain
factual issues that it held should have been submitted to the jury litton may
now attempt to seek review of this decision by the us supreme court

    when preparing for the patenttort damages retrial that was scheduled for
may 1997 litton had submitted a revised damage study to the trial court
seeking damages as high as 19 billion we do not expect that if litton files
an appeal to the us supreme court it will ultimately succeed we do not expect
that in the absence of any patent infringement litton will be able to prove any
tortious conduct by the former honeywell under state law that interfered with
littons contracts or business prospects we believe that it is reasonably
possible that no damages will ultimately be awarded to litton

    although it is not possible at this time to predict whether litton will seek
review by the us supreme court and whether such an appeal would succeed
potential does remain for an adverse outcome which could be material to our
financial position or results of operations we believe however that any
potential award of damages for an adverse judgment of infringement or
interference should be based upon a reasonable royalty reflecting the value of
the ionbeam coating process and further that such an award would not be
material to our financial position or results of operations as a result of the
uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter no provision has been made in
the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability

    antitrust case  preparations for and conduct of the trial in the
antitrust case have generally followed the completion of comparable proceedings
in the patenttort case the antitrust trial did not begin until november 20
1995 judge pfaelzer also presided over the trial but it was held before a
different jury at the close of evidence and before jury deliberations began
the trial court dismissed for failure of proof littons contentions that the
former honeywell had illegally monopolized and attempted to monopolize by

    i engaging in belowcost predatory pricing

   ii tying and bundling product offerings under packaged pricing

  iii misrepresenting its products and disparaging litton products and

   iv acquiring the sperry avionics business in 1986

    on february 2 1996 the case was submitted to the jury on the remaining
allegations that the former honeywell had illegally monopolized and attempted to
monopolize by

    i entering into certain longterm exclusive dealing and penalty
        arrangements with aircraft manufacturers and airlines to exclude litton
        from the commercial aircraft market and

   ii failing to provide litton with access to proprietary software used in
        the cockpits of certain business jets

    on february 29 1996 the jury returned a 234 million single damages
verdict against the former honeywell for illegal monopolization which verdict
would have been automatically trebled on march 1 1996 the jury indicated that
it was unable to reach a verdict on damages for the attempt to monopolize claim
and a mistrial was declared as to that claim

    the former honeywell subsequently filed a motion for judgment as a matter of
law and a motion for a new trial contending among other things that the
jurys partial verdict should be overturned because the former honeywell was
prejudiced at trial and litton failed to prove essential elements of liability
or submit competent evidence to support its speculative allornothing
2985 million damage claim litton filed motions for entry of judgment and
injunctive relief on july 24 1996 the trial court denied the former
honeywells alternative motions for judgment as a matter of law or a complete
new trial but concluded that littons damage study was seriously flawed and
granted the former honeywell a retrial on damages only the court also denied
littons two motions at that time judge pfaelzer was expected to conduct the
retrial of antitrust damages sometime following the retrial of patenttort
damages however after the us supreme court remanded the patenttort case to
the federal circuit in march 1997 litton moved to have the trial court
expeditiously schedule the antitrust damages retrial in september 1997 the
trial court rejected that motion indicating that it wished to know the outcome
of the current patenttort appeal before scheduling retrials of any type

    following the april 7 1998 federal circuit panel decision in the
patenttort case litton again petitioned the trial court to schedule the
retrial of antitrust damages the trial court tentatively scheduled the trial to
commence in the fourth quarter of 1998 and reopened limited discovery and other
pretrial preparations litton then filed another antitrust damage claim of
nearly 300 million

    the damages only retrial began october 29 1998 before judge pfaelzer and a
new jury on december 9 1998 the jury returned verdicts against the former
honeywell totaling 250 million 220 million of which is in favor of litton and
30 million of which is in favor of its sister corporation litton systems
canada limited

    on january 27 1999 the court vacated its prior mistrial ruling with
respect to the attempt to monopolize claim and entered a treble damages judgment
in the total amount of 750 million for actual and attempted monopolization the
former honeywell filed appropriate postjudgment motions with the trial court
and litton filed motions seeking to add substantial attorneys fees and costs to
the judgment a hearing on the postjudgment motions was held before the trial
court on may 20 1999 on september 24 1999 the trial court issued rulings
denying the former honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion
for new trial and remittitur as they related to litton systems inc but

granting the former honeywells motion for judgment as a matter of law as it
relates to litton systems canada limited the net effect of these rulings was
to reduce the existing judgment against the former honeywell of 750 million to
660 million plus attorney fees and costs of approximately 35 million both
parties have appealed the judgment as to both liability and damages to the
us court of appeals for the ninth circuit execution of the trial courts
judgment is stayed pending resolution of the former honeywells postjudgment
motions and the disposition of any appeals filed by the parties

    we expect to obtain substantial relief from the current adverse judgment in
the antitrust case by an appeal to the ninth circuit based upon sound
substantive and procedural legal grounds we believe that there was no factual
or legal basis for the magnitude of the jurys award in the damages retrial and
that as was the case in the first trial the jurys award should be overturned
we also believe there are serious questions concerning the identity and nature
of the business arrangements and conduct which were found by the first antitrust
jury in 1996 to be anticompetitive and damaging to litton and the verdict of
liability should be overturned as a matter of law

    although it is not possible at this time to predict the result of the
appeals potential remains for an adverse outcome which could be material to our
financial position or results of operations as a result of the uncertainty
regarding the outcome of this matter no provision has been made in the
financial statements with respect to this contingent liability we also believe
that it would be inappropriate for litton to obtain recovery of the same
damages eg losses it suffered due to the former honeywells sales of ring
laser gyroscopebased inertial systems to oems and airline customers under
multiple legal theories claims and cases and that eventually any duplicative
recovery would be eliminated from the antitrust and patenttort cases

    shareowner litigation  honeywell and seven of its officers were named as
defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states
district court for the district of new jersey the securities law complaints
the securities law complaints principally allege that the defendants violated
federal securities laws by purportedly making false and misleading statements
and by failing to disclose material information concerning honeywells financial
performance thereby allegedly causing the value of honeywells stock to be
artifically inflated the purported class period for which damages are sought is
december 20 1999 to june 19 2000

    in addition honeywell seven of its officers and its board have been named
as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action which was filed on
november 27 2000 in the united states district court for the district of new
jersey the derivative complaint the derivative complaint alleges a single
claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical allegations to
those set forth in the securities law complaints

    we believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the securities law complaints and the derivative complaint although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases we expect to
prevail however an adverse outcome could be material to our financial position
or results of operations no provision has been made in our financial statements
with respect to this contingent liability

    environmental matters  in accordance with our accounting policy see
note 1 liabilities are recorded for environmental matters generally no later
than the completion of feasibility studies although we do not currently possess
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of the liabilities to
be recorded upon future completion of studies they may be significant to the
consolidated results of operations but we do not expect that they will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position the liabilities
for environmental costs recorded in accrued liabilities and other liabilities at
december 31 2000 were 171 and 215 million respectively and at december 31
1999 were 104 and 245 million respectively

    other matters  we are subject to a number of other lawsuits
investigations and claims some of which involve substantial amounts arising
out of the conduct of our business with respect to all these other matters
including those relating to commercial transactions government contracts

liability and nonenvironmental health and safety matters while the ultimate
results of these lawsuits investigations and claims cannot be determined we do
not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or financial position

    we have issued or are a party to various direct and indirect guarantees
bank letters of credit and customer guarantees we do not expect that these
guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position
