bhc activities

the company is a bhc under the bhc act and has elected to be a financial holding company “fhc” bhcs that qualify and elect to be treated as fhcs may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bhc 

if an fhc or a depository institution controlled by an fhc ceases to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the fhc and may place 

 

limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that fhcs are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists the fhc may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bhcs that are not fhcs in addition if a depository institution controlled by an fhc does not receive a community reinvestment act “cra” rating of at least “satisfactory” at its most recent examination the federal reserve will prohibit the fhc from conducting new business activities that fhcs are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions 

the federal reserve also requires bhcs to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

permissible business activities

as an fhc the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as long as the company meets the capital managerial and cra requirements to qualify as an fhc however the company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion fhcs are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bhc bank or savings association in addition banks must receive approval before they may acquire merge with acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies 

interstate banking

a bhc may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bhc controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bhc’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions

in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

in july 2021 the current united states presidential administration issued an executive order on competition which included provisions relating to bank mergers these provisions encourage the department of justice and 

 

the federal banking regulators to update guidelines on banking mergers and to provide more scrutiny of bank mergers a number of large bank deals that were pending at the time of the executive order have not yet obtained approval or obtained approval on an extended time frame the company is unable to predict what impact the executive order will have on the timing of or ability to obtain regulatory approvals of mergers including its pending merger with mufg union bank 

source of strength 

the company is required to act as a source of strength to us bank national association and to commit capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so under these requirements the federal reserve may in the future require the company to provide financial assistance to us bank national association should it experience financial distress capital loans by the company to us bank national association would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of us bank national association 

occ heightened standards 

us bank national association is subject to the occ’s guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks which establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

enhanced prudential standards 

under the doddfrank act as modified by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act and the tailoring rules large bank holding companies such as the company are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organization’s size and certain “riskbased indicators” the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the company are described below in further detail 

dividend restrictions

the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

in addition the federal reserve’s final rule implementing the stress capital buffer “scb” provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan the rule also provides that a bhc must resubmit its capital plan if among other things the bhc determines there has been or will be a material change in the bhc’s risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since the bhc last submitted its capital plan 

capital requirements

the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committee’s framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks “basel iii” as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner 

 

under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association are each subject to “category iii” standards and are “standardized approach” banking organizations that are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital substantial growth in total consolidated assets including assets obtained in acquisitions or crossjurisdictional activity as defined in the tailoring rules could affect the company’s continued classification as a “category iii” institution which could result in more stringent capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements 

under the united states basel iiibased

capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 “cet1” capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent the company is also subject to the scb which is based on the results of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress tests and the company’s planned common stock dividends and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future the scb generally is assigned on an annual basis and becomes effective on october 1 of each year subject to a 25 percent floor and may vary over time as of december 31 2021 the scb applicable to the company is 25 percent if the federal reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer or if the scb applicable to the company were to exceed 25 percent this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject 

banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and “eligible retained income” defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters 

united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 percent as a category iii banking organization the company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio “slr” of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance

sheet and certain offbalance

sheet exposures at december 31 2021 the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and slr requirements 

in december 2017 the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” including unused lines of credit and improve the comparability of capital ratios by i enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk ii constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased “irb” approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk iii introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks “gsibs”

and iv replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committee’s revised basel iii standardized approaches under the basel standards the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratios as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks is january 1 2023 in addition in january 2019 the basel committee published a revised market risk framework that among other things revises the standardized approach for market risk the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january 1 2023 with full implementation by january 1 2028 the effects of these revisions on the company and us bank national association will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the united states federal banking agencies at this time a united states based rule has not been released 

 

in 2020 the united states federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations including the company and us bank national association to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard “cecl” on regulatory capital until january 2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects through january 2025 through the 2021 stress test cycle the federal reserve has not yet incorporated cecl into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests for further discussion of cecl see notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2021 annual report the company and us bank national association elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of cecl in accordance with this rule 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see “capital management” in the 2021 annual report 

comprehensive capital analysis and review

as required by the federal reserve’s ccar rules the company submits a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis as part of the ccar process the federal reserve evaluates the company’s plans to make capital distributions including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments under a number of macroeconomic and companyspecific assumptions based on the company’s and the federal reserve’s stress tests described under “stress testing” below these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy and a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio without taking the buffers into account under expected and stressful conditions 

stress testing

the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require bhcs subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun

stress tests and subject such bank holding companies to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun

stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions as opposed to the company’s planned capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models and incorporates the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively into its stress tests the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun

stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each applicable year 

under the occ’s rules national banks with assets in excess of 250 billion including us bank national association are required to submit companyrun

stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bhc’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario 

basel iii liquidity requirements

as a category iii banking organization the company is subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days in addition the company and us bank national association are subject to the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” rule which became effective in july 2021 and is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear

time horizon under the tailoring rules and nsfr rule the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding qualify for reduced lcr and nsfr requirements calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as us bank national association if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the regulations apply only to banks and not to bhcs such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the bhc level based on the undercapitalized status of the bhc’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized bank the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance

the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of 250000 per depositor deposits at us national bank are insured up to the applicable limits the dif is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions including us bank national association based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the fdic may increase us bank national association’s insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdic’s assessment of its risk profile 

in addition large insured depository institutions including us bank national association are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail 

depositor preference

under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic

offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution 

orderly liquidation authority

upon the insolvency of a bhc such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bhc if the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of a financial company’s failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a bhc without the approval of its creditors 

resolution plans 

the company is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose on the company more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the company’s growth activities or operations if the company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when required it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations as a category iii banking organization the company is required to submit resolution plans on a triennial cycle alternating between 

 

targeted and full submissions in december 2020 the federal reserve and the fdic released targeted plan guidance and directed large foreign and domestic banks to file resolution plans including core elements of a firm’s resolution strategy as well as how each firm has integrated changes to and lessons learned from its response to covid19

into its resolution planning process the company submitted its targeted resolution plan in december 2021 

in addition us bank national association is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institution’s creditors in june 2021 the fdic issued a statement on resolution plans for insured depository institutions the “fdic statement” among other things the fdic statement establishes a threeyear filing cycle for banks with 100 billion or more in total assets and provides details regarding the content that filers will be expected to prepare the fdic statement also divides covered insured depository institutions “idis” into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions with the first group consisting of idis for which the parent is not a united states gsib

or “category ii” firm under this guidance us bank national association is in the first group 

recovery plans

the occ has established enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more including us bank national association the guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the guidelines state that a recovery plan should among other elements i establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response ii identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and iii address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures the board of us bank national association reviewed and approved us bank national association’s recovery plan pursuant to these guidelines in december 2021

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

general

as a bank holding company the company is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by the federal reserve us bank national association and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation examination and supervision primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the fdic the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” in certain areas 

supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank holding company’s or bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association the company and the company’s nonbank

affiliates must undergo regular onsite

examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance requirements if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions supervision and examinations are confidential and the outcomes of these actions generally are not made public 

banking and other financial services statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by the united states congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the company and its subsidiaries any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization 

as a bank holding company with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets the company is subject to the doddfrank act’s enhanced prudential standards requirements the doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” however mandated that the federal reserve tailor the enhanced prudential standards applicable to a bank holding company or category of bank holding companies based on several factors including size capital structure complexity and other riskrelated factors in october 2019 the federal banking regulators adopted two final rules the “tailoring rules” that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large united states banking organizations including the company and us bank national association and that tailored the application of the federal reserve’s enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations the rules applicable to the company and us bank national association are described in more detail below 

supervisory ratings

federal banking regulators regularly examine the company and us bank national association to evaluate their financial condition and monitor their compliance with laws and regulatory policies following those exams the company and us bank national association are assigned supervisory ratings these ratings are considered confidential supervisory information and disclosure to third parties is not allowed 

 

without permission of the issuing regulator violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management or compliance practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings could limit the company’s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments affect us bank national association’s deposit insurance assessment rate and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the company 

in november 2018 the federal reserve adopted the large financial institution rating system “lfi rating system” which replaced the prior rating system for large financial institutions including the company and aligned the supervisory rating system with the federal reserve’s supervisory programs for these firms as compared to the rating system it replaced which continues to be used for smaller bank holding companies the lfi rating system places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity including related planning and risk management practices ratings issued under the lfi rating system will remain confidential 

the federal reserve has also proposed guidance for the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system that addresses the role of boards of directors as well as the responsibilities of members of senior and business line management and controls at large financial institutions 

bank holding company activities

the company is a bank holding company under the bhc act and has elected to be a financial holding company pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s nonbank

subsidiaries are primarily regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists the financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition if a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company does not receive a community reinvestment act “cra” rating of at least “satisfactory” at its most recent examination the federal reserve will prohibit the financial holding company from conducting new business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions 

the federal reserve also requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

permissible business activities

as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve as long as the company meets the capital managerial and cra requirements to qualify as a financial holding company however the company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association in addition banks must receive approval before they may acquire merge with acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies 

interstate banking

a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions

in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

source of strength 

the company is required to act as a source of strength to us bank national association and to commit capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so under these requirements the federal reserve may in the future require the company to provide financial assistance to us bank national association should it experience financial distress capital loans by the company to us bank national association would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of us bank national association in the event of the company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of us bank national association would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

occ heightened standards 

the occ has issued guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

enhanced prudential standards 

under the doddfrank act as modified by the egrrcpa and the tailoring rules large bank holding companies such as the company are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organization’s size status as a global systemically important bank crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance

sheet exposures the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution 

 

plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests these standards also require the federal reserve to impose a maximum 15to1

debttoequity

ratio on a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more if the financial stability oversight council determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and that the imposition of such a debttoequity

requirement would mitigate such risk in addition the federal reserve is required to establish early remediation requirements for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more but these requirements have not yet been finalized 

certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the company are described below in further detail including changes that have been made to these requirements under the tailoring rules 

dividend restrictions

the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

in march 2020 the federal reserve approved a final rule replacing the static 25 percent component of the capital conservation buffer with the stress capital buffer “scb” for bank holding companies with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets such as the company the scb reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the ccar stress tests described in more detail in “stress testing” below and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends the scb is subject to a 25 percent floor a firm’s scb requirement is generally effective on october 1 of each year and remains in effect until october 1 of the following year unless the firm’s scb is reset in connection with a resubmission of a capital plan the company’s first scb requirement of 25 percent took effect on october 1 2020 

the final rule implementing the scb also provides that a bank holding company must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bank holding company is required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with the november 2020 resubmission described under “comprehensive capital analysis and review” below the federal reserve required those bank holding companies including the company to suspend stock repurchases during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the past four quarters in december 2020 the federal reserve announced that these bank holding companies could continue existing dividend payments and resume stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 as long as the combined amounts of repurchases and dividends in that quarter do not exceed the bank holding company’s average earnings per quarter over the last four quarters 

capital requirements

the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committee’s framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks “basel iii” as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner 

 

under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association are each subject to “category iii” standards because they are not subject to “category i” or “category ii” standards and have at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets accordingly the company and us bank national association are “standardized approach” banking organizations as “standardized approach” banking organizations the company and us bank national association are subject to the final rule adopted by the banking regulators in july 2019 relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to nonadvanced

approach organizations these rules became effective on january 1 2020 and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital 

under the united states basel iiibased

capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 “cet1” capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent the company is also subject to the scb which is based on the results of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress tests and the company’s planned common stock dividends and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 the countercyclical capital buffer applies only to banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future the scb replaces the static 25 percent component of the capital conservation buffer and is likely to vary over time as of december 31 2020 the scb applicable to the company is 25 percent if the federal reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent or if the scb applicable to the company were to exceed 25 percent this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject 

banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and “eligible retained income” since march 2020 defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters with progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as the company approaches the minimum ratios 

united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 percent banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio “slr” of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance

sheet and certain offbalance

sheet exposures at december 31 2020 the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and slr requirements 

in december 2017 the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” including unused lines of credit and improve the comparability of capital ratios by i enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk ii constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased “irb” approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk iii introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks “gsibs”

and iv replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committee’s revised basel iii standardized approaches under the basel standards the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratios as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks is january 1 2023 in addition in january 2019 the basel committee published a revised market 

 

risk framework that among other things revises the standardized approach for market risk the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january 1 2023 with full implementation by january 1 2028 the effects of these revisions on the company and us bank national association will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the united states federal banking agencies 

during 2020 the united states federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allows banking organizations including the company and us bank national association to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard “cecl” on regulatory capital until january 2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects through january 2025 the federal reserve has also stated that it will not incorporate cecl into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle for further discussion of cecl see notes 1 2 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2020 annual report the company and us bank national association elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of cecl in accordance with this rule 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see “capital management” in the 2020 annual report

in june 2020 all bank holding companies participating in ccar 2020 including the company were required by the federal reserve to resubmit their capital plans in november 2020 in light of the ongoing economic effects of the covid19

pandemic after reviewing the resubmitted capital plans in december 2020 the federal reserve announced that these bank holding companies including the company could continue existing dividend payments and resume stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 as long as the combined amounts of repurchases and dividends in that quarter do not exceed the bank holding company’s average earnings per quarter over the last four quarters 

stress testing

the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require bank holding companies subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun

stress tests and subject such bank holding companies to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun

stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions as opposed to the company’s planned capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun

stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each applicable year under the tailoring rules the company is no longer required to conduct midcycle

stress tests and the federal reserve has eliminated the adverse scenario as a mandatory scenario 

in october 2019 the occ adopted a final rule that aligned the stress testing requirements for national banks with requirements for their holding companies under the tailoring rules under the occ’s rule national banks 

 

with assets in excess of 250 billion including us bank national association are required to submit companyrun

stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve accordingly us bank national association began submitting companyrun

stress tests on a biennial basis starting with its 2020 submission the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and which will no longer include “adverse” stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario 

basel iii liquidity requirements

bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules are subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days 

in october 2020 the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear

time horizon and applies to the company and us bank national association the final rule is generally similar to the may 2016 proposal with modifications to incorporate the changes made in the tailoring rules and align funding requirements for certain nonderivative

assets and shortterm lending transactions to better reflect their risks and role in supporting the stability of certain funding markets 

under the tailoring rules and final nsfr rule the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding qualify for reduced lcr and nsfr requirements calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements 

brokered deposits

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” and fdic regulations limit the ability of an insured depository institution such as us bank national association to accept renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described below or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic in addition less than wellcapitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits in december 2020 the fdic issued a final rule that is designed to encourage innovation in how banks offer services and products to customers by reducing obstacles to certain types of partnerships and that is expected to reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered full compliance with the final rule is required as of january 1 2022 us bank national association is reviewing its deposits in light of the final rule the ultimate impact of the final rule on us bank national association may be limited because the liquidity rules’ treatment of certain deposits remains unchanged even if such deposits would no longer be deemed to be brokered deposits under the fdic’s final rule

prompt corrective action

the fdicia provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as us bank national association if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to 

 

an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

singlecounterparty credit limits

in june 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule regarding singlecounterparty credit limits “sccl” for large banking organizations including the company under these rules the company is subject to a limit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty

depositor preference

under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic

offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution 

orderly liquidation authority

upon the insolvency of a bank holding company such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bank holding company if the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a bank holding company without the approval of its creditors 

resolution plans 

the company is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose on the company more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the company’s growth activities or operations if the company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when 

 

required it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in october 2019 the federal reserve and the fdic adopted a final rule requiring banking organizations that are subject to category iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company to submit resolution plans on a triennial cycle alternating between targeted and full submissions on december 9 2020 the federal reserve and the fdic released targeted plan guidance and directed large foreign and domestic banks to file resolution plans including core elements of a firm’s resolution strategy — such as capital liquidity and recapitalization strategies — as well as how each firm has integrated changes to and lessons learned from its response to covid19

into its resolution planning process the company must submit its targeted resolution plan by december 17 2021 

in addition us bank national association is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors in april 2019 the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions including us bank national association and voted to delay the next round of resolution plan submissions until the rulemaking process is complete in january 2021 the fdic announced that given the passage of time from the last resolution plan submissions and the uncertain economic outlook the fdic will resume requiring resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with 100 billion or more in assets including us bank national association the fdic indicated that no insured depository institution will be required to submit a resolution plan without at least 12 months advance notice but did not otherwise provide notice of when us bank national association will be required to submit its next resolution plan 

the public versions of the resolution plans previously submitted by the company and us bank national association are available on the fdic’s website and in the case of the company’s resolution plans also on the federal reserve’s website

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

 

general

as a bank holding company the company is subject to regulation under the bank holding company act the “bhc act” and to inspection examination and supervision by the federal reserve us bank national association and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation examination and supervision primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the fdic the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” in certain areas 

supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank holding company’s or bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association the company and the company’s nonbank

affiliates must undergo regular onsite

examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance requirements if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions supervision and examinations are confidential and the outcomes of these actions generally are not made public

banking and other financial services statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by the united states congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the company and its subsidiaries any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization 

in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the “egrrcpa” was signed into law among other regulatory changes the egrrcpa amends various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for mandatory application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies from 50 billion to 250 billion bank holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the company remain subject to the doddfrank act enhanced prudential standards requirements described below 

the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa however mandates that the federal reserve tailor the enhanced prudential standards applicable to a banking holding company or category of bank holding companies based on several factors including size capital structure complexity and other riskrelated factors in october 2019 the federal banking regulators adopted two final rules the “tailoring rules” that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large united states banking organizations including the company and us bank national association and that tailored the application of the federal reserve’s enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations the rules applicable to the company and us bank national association are described in more detail below 

supervisory ratings

federal banking regulators regularly examine the company and us bank national association to evaluate their financial condition and monitor their compliance with laws and regulatory policies following those exams the company and us bank national association are assigned supervisory ratings these ratings are considered confidential supervisory information and disclosure to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings could limit the company’s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments affect us bank national association’s deposit insurance assessment rate and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the company 

 

in november 2018 the federal reserve adopted a new rating system the large financial institution rating system “lfi rating system” to align its supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including the company with its current supervisory programs for these firms as compared to the rating system it replaces which will continue to be used for smaller bank holding companies the lfi rating system places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity including related planning and risk management practices the company will receive its first ratings under the lfi rating system in 2020 these ratings will remain confidential 

the federal reserve has also proposed guidance for the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system that addresses the role of boards of directors as well as the responsibilities of members of senior and business line management and controls at large financial institutions 

bank holding company activities

the company is a bank holding company under the bhc act and has elected to be a financial holding company pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s nonbank

subsidiaries are primarily regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists the financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition if a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company does not receive a community reinvestment act “cra” rating of at least “satisfactory” at its most recent examination the federal reserve will prohibit the financial holding company from conducting new business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions 

the federal reserve also requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

permissible business activities

as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve as long as the company meets the capital managerial and cra requirements to qualify as a financial holding company however the company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an 

 

unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association in addition banks must receive approval before they may acquire merge with acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies 

interstate banking

a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions

in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

source of strength 

the company is required to act as a source of strength to us bank national association and to commit capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so under these requirements the federal reserve may in the future require the company to provide financial assistance to us bank national association should it experience financial distress capital loans by the company to us bank national association would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of us bank national association in the event of the company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of us bank national association would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

the federal reserve is prohibited from requiring payment by a bank holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 

occ heightened standards 

the occ has issued guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

enhanced prudential standards 

under the doddfrank act as modified by the egrrcpa and the tailoring rules large bank holding companies such as the company are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organization’s size status as a global systemically important bank crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance

sheet exposures the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests these standards also require the federal reserve to impose a maximum 15to1

debttoequity

ratio on a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of 250 billion

 

or more if the financial stability oversight council determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and that the imposition of such a debttoequity

requirement would mitigate such risk in addition the federal reserve is required to establish early remediation requirements for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more but these requirements have not yet been finalized

certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the company are described below in further detail including changes that have been made to these requirements under the tailoring rules 

dividend restrictions

the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is also limited by federal reserve regulations and policy large bank holding companies such as the company may generally only pay dividends and repurchase stock in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” below for further details 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

the company and us bank national association must maintain the applicable common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends for more information on the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and the stress buffer requirements that the federal reserve has proposed that would replace the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer for bank holding companies see “capital requirements” and “proposed stress buffer requirements” below respectively 

capital requirements

the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committee’s framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks “basel iii” as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner 

under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association are each subject to “category iii” standards because they are not subject to “category i” or “category ii” standards and have at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets accordingly the company and us bank national association are now “standardized approach” banking organizations and are no longer required to calculate riskbased capital ratios under the advanced approaches as “standardized approach” banking organizations the company and us bank national association are subject to the final rule adopted by the banking regulators in july 2019 relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to nonadvanced

approach organizations these rules became effective on january 1 2020 and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital

 

under the united states basel iiibased

capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 “cet1” capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent the company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 the countercyclical capital buffer applies only to banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future which would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject

banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and “eligible retained income” that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income with progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as the company approaches the minimum ratios 

in april 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule that would among other things replace the capital conservation buffer requirement with a stress capital buffer requirement for large bank holding companies subject to the federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” please refer to the “proposed stress buffer requirements” section below for further details although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios 

united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 percent banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio “slr” of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance

sheet and certain offbalance

sheet exposures at december 31 2019 the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and slr requirements

prompt corrective action

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as us bank national association if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

brokered deposits

the fdicia and fdic regulations limit the ability of an insured depository institution such as us bank national association to accept renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described above or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic in addition less than wellcapitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits in december 2019 the fdic issued a proposed rule that is designed to bring the brokered deposits regulations in line with modern deposit taking methods and that may reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered the impact on the company and us bank national association from any changes to the brokered deposit regulations will depend on the final form of the proposed rule which the company is not able to predict 

comprehensive capital analysis and review

as required by the federal reserve’s ccar rules the company submits a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis as part of the ccar process the federal reserve evaluates the company’s plans to make capital distributions including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments under a number of macroeconomic and companyspecific assumptions based on the company’s and the federal reserve’s stress tests described under “stress testing” below the company may generally only pay dividends and repurchase stock in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and to which the federal reserve has not objected these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio without taking the buffers into account under expected and stressful conditions 

the company submitted its 2019 capital plan to the federal reserve in april 2019 the federal reserve did not object to the company’s 2019 capital plan 

the company will submit its 2020 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5 2020 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the 

 

results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than june 30 2020 

in april 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposal to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements which would make changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the proposed rule including the company please refer to the “proposed stress buffer requirements” section below for further details 

stress testing

the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require bank holding companies subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun

stress tests and subject such bank holding companies to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun

stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun

stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each applicable year under the tailoring rules the company is no longer required to conduct midcycle

stress tests and the federal reserve has eliminated the adverse scenario as a mandatory scenario

in october 2019 the occ adopted a final rule that aligned the stress testing requirements for national banks with requirements for their holding companies under the tailoring rules under the occ’s rule national banks with assets in excess of 250 billion including us bank national association are required to submit companyrun

stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve accordingly us bank national association is now required to submit companyrun

stress tests on a biennial basis beginning with its 2020 submission the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and which will no longer include “adverse” stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by april 6 2020 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than june 30 2020

proposed stress buffer requirements

in april 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposal to create a single capital requirement by integrating its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements the proposal which would apply to certain bank holding companies including the company would introduce a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer or stress buffer requirements and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes for riskbased capital requirements the stress capital buffer would replace the static capital conservation buffer the stress capital buffer would equal the greater of i the maximum decline in the company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of its planned common stock dividends to its projected riskweighted assets for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period and ii 25 percent 

the proposal would make related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the stress buffer requirements in particular the proposal would remove the 30 percent dividend payout ratio that has been used as a threshold for heightened supervisory scrutiny and would assume that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and riskweighted assets throughout the supervisory stress test projection period 

 

basel iii liquidity requirements

bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules are subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days 

in june 2016 the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear

time horizon and would apply to the company and us bank national association federal banking regulators continue to work on finalizing the rule to implement the nsfr

under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding would qualify for reduced lcr requirements calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements in addition although the tailoring rules did not adopt the proposed nsfr the federal reserve indicated that it would apply a reduced 85 percent nsfr to category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding including the company and us bank national association 

singlecounterparty credit limits

in june 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule regarding singlecounterparty credit limits “sccl” for large banking organizations including the company under these rules the company is subject to a limit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty the company must comply with the final sccl rules beginning on july 1 2020 

deposit insurance

the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of 250000 per depositor deposits at us national bank are insured up to the applicable limits the dif is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions including us bank national association based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the fdic may increase us bank national association’s insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdic’s assessment of its risk profile 

in addition large insured depository institutions including us bank national association are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail us bank national association must comply with these new requirements by april 1 2020 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution

if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to i transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors ii enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or iii repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference

under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic

offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution

orderly liquidation authority

upon the insolvency of a bank holding company such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bank holding company if the secretary of the treasury 

 

 

determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a bank holding company without the approval of its creditors 

resolution plans 

the company is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose on the company more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the company’s growth activities or operations if the company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when required it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in october 2019 the federal reserve and the fdic adopted a final rule requiring banking organizations that are subject to category iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company to submit resolution plans on a triennial cycle alternating between targeted and full submissions under the tailoring rules the company’s next resolution plan a targeted submission is due by july 1 2021 

in addition us bank national association is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors in april 2019 the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions including us bank national association and voted to delay the next round of resolution plan submissions until the rulemaking process is complete 

the public versions of the resolution plans previously submitted by the company and us bank national association are available on the fdic’s website and in the case of the company’s resolution plans also on the federal reserve’s website 

recovery plans

the occ has established enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more including us bank national association the guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the guidelines state that a recovery plan should among other elements i establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response ii identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and iii address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures the board of us bank national association approved a recovery plan pursuant to these guidelines in december 2019 

liability of commonly controlled institutions

an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive the company competes with other commercial banks savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions investment companies credit card companies and a variety of other financial services advisory and technology companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

government policies 

the operations of the company’s various businesses are affected by federal and state laws and legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities including the statutes and the rules and policies of regulatory authorities of the numerous states in which they operate the united states and foreign governments these policies include for example statutory maximum legal lending rates domestic monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” united states fiscal policy international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies 

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

general as a bank holding company the company is subject to regulation under the bank holding company act the “bhc act” and to inspection examination and supervision by the federal reserve us bank national association and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation examination and supervision primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the fdic the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” in certain areas 

supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank holding company’s or bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association the company and the company’s nonbank affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions supervision and examinations are confidential and the outcomes of these actions will not be made public 

banking and other financial services statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the company and its subsidiaries any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which the company is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place while the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework the company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision 

on may 24 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the “egrrcpa” was signed into law among other regulatory changes the egrrcpa amends various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies from 50 billion to 250 billion bank holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the company remain subject to the doddfrank act enhanced prudential standards requirements 

the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa however mandates that the federal reserve tailor the enhanced prudential standards applicable to a banking holding company or category of bank holding companies based on several factors including size capital structure complexity and other riskrelated factors on october 31 2018 the federal banking regulators issued proposed rules pursuant to the egrrcpa to adjust the thresholds at which certain enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements would apply to united states bank holding companies and their depository institutions with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets the “proposed tailoring rules” under the proposed tailoring rules these bank holding 

 

companies and banks including the company and us bank national association would be placed into one of four riskbased categories based on the banking organization’s size status as a global systemically important bank crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposures the extent to which enhanced prudential standards and certain other capital and liquidity standards would apply to these bank holding companies and banks would depend upon the banking organization’s category under the proposed tailoring rules which remain subject to finalization and may be revised the company and us bank national association would each qualify as a category iii banking organization subject to proposed requirements applicable to banking organizations that are not subject to category i or ii standards and that have at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets and 75 billion or more in any one of three indicators 1 nonbank assets 2 weighted shortterm wholesale funding or 3 offbalance sheet exposures in connection with the proposed tailoring rules the federal reserve indicated the firms that would fall into each of the four categories based on data for the second quarter of 2018 according to the federal reserve’s projections which could change in accordance with any final rules the company and us bank national association would be “category iii” banking organizations under the proposed tailoring rules and several regulatory requirements currently applicable to the company and us bank national association would be reduced or eliminated as discussed in further detail in the paragraphs that follow 

the ultimate benefits or consequences of the egrrcpa for the company us bank national association their other subsidiaries and their activities will depend on the final form of the proposed tailoring rules and additional rulemakings to implement the act that are expected to be issued by the united states banking agencies which cannot be predicted 

supervisory ratings federal banking regulators regularly examine the company and us bank national association to evaluate their financial condition and monitor their compliance with laws and regulatory policies following those exams the company and us bank national association are assigned supervisory ratings these ratings are considered confidential supervisory information and disclosure to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings could limit the company’s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments affect us bank national association’s deposit insurance assessment rate and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the company 

in november 2018 the federal reserve adopted a new rating system the large financial institution rating system “lfi rating system” to align its supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including the company with its current supervisory programs for these firms as compared to the rating system it replaces which will continue to be used for smaller bank holding companies the lfi rating system places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity including related planning and risk management practices the company will receive its first ratings under the lfi rating system in 2020 these ratings will remain confidential 

in august 2017 the federal reserve also issued proposed guidance with respect to its expectations regarding the supervisory role of boards of directors of large financial institutions in addition in january 2018 the federal reserve proposed guidance relating to the supervisory responsibilities of members of senior and business line management for risk management and controls at large financial institutions both of these proposals are meant to set regulatory expectations for the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system 

bank holding company activities the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba qualifying bank holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of 

 

functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition if a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company does not receive a community reinvestment act “cra” rating of at least “satisfactory” at its most recent examination the financial holding company will have limitations placed on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions 

the federal reserve also requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve as long as it meets the capital managerial and cra requirements to qualify as a financial holding company however the company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association banks must receive approval before they may acquire merge with acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies 

interstate banking a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition 

 

financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

source of strength the company is required to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank 

under these requirements the company may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to us bank national association should it experience financial distress capital loans by the company to us bank national association would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of us bank national association in the event of the company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of us bank national association would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

the federal reserve is prohibited from requiring payment by a bank holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 

occ heightened standards the occ has issued guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act as modified by the egrrcpa bank holding companies with consolidated assets of more than 250 billion such as the company are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests these standards also require the federal reserve to impose a maximum 15to1 debttoequity ratio on a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more if the financial stability oversight council determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and that the imposition of such a debttoequity requirement would mitigate such risk in addition the federal reserve is required to establish early remediation requirements for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more 

certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the company are described below in further detail including changes that have been proposed to these requirements under the proposed tailoring rules 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is also limited by federal reserve regulations and policy large bank holding companies such as the company may generally only pay dividends and repurchase stock in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” below for further details 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

the company and us bank national association must maintain the applicable common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends as of january 1 2019 the fully phased in common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer is 25 percent for more information on the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and the stress buffer requirements that the federal reserve has proposed that would replace the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer for bank holding companies see “capital requirements” and “proposed stress buffer requirements” below respectively 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns ie declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

capital requirements the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under the united states basel iiibased capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel iii international regulatory capital standards in the united states as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner the united states basel iiibased capital rules include two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets a general standardized approach and more risksensitive advanced approaches with the company’s capital adequacy being evaluated against the methodology that is most restrictive 

under the united states basel iiibased capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent the company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer on top of the three minimum riskweighted capital ratios listed above banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall with progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as the company approaches the minimum ratios 

 

on april 10 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposal that would create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the capital conservation buffer requirement with the quantitative assessment of firms’ capital plans under the federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” please refer to the “proposed stress buffer requirements” section below for further details although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios 

united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum leverage ratio of 40 percent banking organizations that calculate their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio “slr” of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures the slr is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure which includes both on and offbalance sheet exposures the company began calculating and reporting its slr beginning in the first quarter of 2015 and became subject to the minimum slr requirement on january 1 2018 at december 31 2018 the company exceeded the applicable minimum slr requirement 

in december 2017 the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets and improve the comparability of capital ratios by a enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk b constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased “irb” approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk c introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks “gsibs and d replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committee’s revised basel iii standardized approaches january 1 2022 is the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratio as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january 1 2022 with full implementation by january 1 2027 federal banking regulators are expected to undertake rulemakings in future years to implement these revisions in the united states 

under the proposed tailoring rules the company as a category iii banking organization would no longer be required to calculate riskbased capital ratios under the advanced approaches for purposes of determining regulatory compliance instead the company’s riskbased capital ratios would be calculated using only the standardized approach the company would remain subject to the slr and the countercyclical capital buffer in addition the company as a category iii banking organization would be permitted to opt out of recognizing accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” in common equity tier 1 capital for purposes of calculating its regulatory capital ratios the company cannot predict whether the final form of the proposed tailoring rules will exempt the company from using the advanced approaches to calculate riskbased capital ratios or permit the company to opt out of including aoci in its calculation of common equity tier 1 capital 

in addition in december 2018 the united states federal banking agencies finalized rules that provide banking organizations the option to phasein over a three year period the dayone adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule for further discussion of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2018 annual report

prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant 

 

federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plan rule currently requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan in connection with its annual ccar process the company may generally only pay dividends and repurchase stock in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and to which the federal reserve has not objected these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the united states basel iiibased capital rules 

the company submitted its 2018 capital plan to the federal reserve in april 2018 the federal reserve did not object to the company’s 2018 capital plan 

the company will submit its 2019 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5 2019 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than june 30 2019 

in april 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposal to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements which would make changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the proposed rule including the company please refer to the “proposed stress buffer requirements” section below for further details 

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are currently required to submit a midcycle 

 

companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early october of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of november of each year the federal reserve currently publishes summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are currently required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by april 5 2019 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than june 30 2019 

under the proposed eps tailoring rule the company as a category iii banking organization would remain subject to annual supervisory stress tests but would be subject to companyrun stress tests every two years instead of annually consistent with egrrcpa the federal reserve also has proposed to eliminate the midcycle stress testing requirement for all banking organizations as of 2020 and eliminate the adverse scenario from all stress testing requirements the company cannot predict whether the proposed eps tailoring rule and other related issuances will be adopted as proposed or whether any changes will be made to it that would affect the stress testing requirements applicable to the company 

proposed stress buffer requirements on april 10 2018 the federal reserve issued a proposal to create a single capital requirement by integrating its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements the proposal which would apply to certain bank holding companies including the company would introduce a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer or stress buffer requirements and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes for riskbased capital requirements the stress capital buffer would replace the existing capital conservation buffer which is 25 percent as of january 1 2019 the stress capital buffer would equal the greater of i the maximum decline in the company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of its planned common stock dividends to its projected riskweighted assets for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period and ii 25 percent 

the proposal would make related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the stress buffer requirements in particular the proposal would remove the 30 percent dividend payout ratio that has been used as a threshold for heightened supervisory scrutiny and would assume that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and riskweighted assets throughout the supervisory stress test projection period 

in november 2018 the federal reserve’s vice chairman for supervision stated that the federal reserve does not expect that the proposed stress buffer requirements will go into effect before 2020 and that although the federal reserve expects to finalize certain elements of those requirements as proposed other elements of the proposal will be reproposed and again subject to public comment 

basel iii liquidity requirements bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries that calculate their capital requirements using the advanced approaches including the company and us bank national association are subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days 

in june 2016 the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a 

 

oneyear time horizon and would apply to the company and us bank national association federal banking regulators continue to work on finalizing the rule to implement the nsfr 

under the proposed tailoring rules the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding would qualify for reduced lcr and proposed nsfr requirements calibrated at 7085 percent of the full requirements the company cannot predict whether the final form of the proposed tailoring rules will subject the company and us bank national association to reduced lcr and proposed nsfr requirements 

singlecounterparty credit limits on june 14 2018 the federal reserve finalized rules that establish singlecounterparty credit limits “sccl” for large banking organizations including the company under these rules the company is subject to a limit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty the company must comply with the final sccl rules beginning on january 1 2020 

deposit insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of 250000 per depositor and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions based on the risk each institution poses to the dif us bank national association accepts customer deposits that are insured by the dif and therefore must pay insurance premiums the fdic may increase us bank national association’s insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdic’s assessment of its risk profile until september 30 2018 banks with 10 billion or more in total assets such as us bank national association were required to pay an assessment surcharge this requirement ended effective september 30 2018 as a result of the fdic’s reserve ratio exceeding 135 percent 

in addition large insured depository institutions including us bank national association are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail us bank national association must comply with these new requirements by april 1 2020 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution 

orderly liquidation authority upon the insolvency of a bank holding company such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bank holding company if the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company acting as a conservator or receiver 

 

the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a bank holding company without the approval of its creditors 

resolution plans as a bank holding company with assets of 250 billion or more the company is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for the orderly resolution of the company and its significant legal entities under the united states bankruptcy code or other applicable insolvency laws in a rapid and orderly fashion in the event of future material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner they may jointly impose on the company more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the company’s growth activities or operations if the company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when required it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations the company submitted its resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic in december 2017 the federal reserve and fdic have extended the filing deadline for certain bank holding companies including the company and as a result the company’s next resolution plan is not due to the federal reserve and fdic until december 31 2019 

in addition us bank national association is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the company submitted its insured depository institution resolution plan to the fdic in july 2018 the fdic’s chairman has indicated that the fdic intends to release an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the fdic’s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size complexity and risk profile until the fdic’s revisions to its bank resolution plan requirement are finalized no bank resolution plans will be required to be filed 

the public versions of the resolution plans previously submitted by the company and us bank national association are available on the fdic’s website and in the case of the company’s resolution plans also on the federal reserve’s website 

recovery plans the occ has established enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks insured federal savings associations and insured federal branches of foreign banks with average total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more which includes us bank national association the guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the guidelines state that a recovery plan should a establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response b identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and c address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures the board of us bank national association approved a recovery plan pursuant to these guidelines in december 2018 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with us bank national 

 

association under the federal reserve act and regulation w us bank national association and its subsidiaries is subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates additionally transactions between us bank national association and its nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm’s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness

noncompliance with sanctions laws andor aml laws or failure to maintain an adequate bsaaml compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger acquisition restructuring or other expansionary activity there have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banks brokerdealers and nonbank financial institutions with respect to sanctions laws and aml laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties including against the company and us bank national association see note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2018 annual report

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive the company competes with other commercial banks savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions investment companies credit card companies and a variety of other financial services advisory and technology companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

government policies

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

  

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

general as a bank holding company the company is subject to regulation under the bank holding company act the “bhc act” and to inspection examination and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” us bank national association and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the fdic the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” in certain areas 

supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association the company and the company’s nonbank affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 

doddfrank act substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

the doddfrank act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes some of which are discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on the size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

bank holding company activities the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba qualifying bank holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and 

  

managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

source of strength the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

occ heightened standards the occ has issued guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

  

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the community reinvestment act “cra” the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

enhanced prudential standards the company is subject to a final rule issued by the federal reserve relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the rule incorporates the requirement that the federal reserve conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the rule provides for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns ie declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

  

the supervisory stress tests of the company conducted by the federal reserve as part of its annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process also affect the ability of the company to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” and “stress testing” below 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements have changed significantly as a result of standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” an international organization that has the goal of creating standards for banking regulation and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the doddfrank act by banking regulators in the united states minimum regulatory capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in 

prior to 2014 regulatory capital requirements effective for the company followed the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee known as basel i in implementing basel i federal banking regulators adopted riskbased capital and leverage rules that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” under the rules capital is divided into multiple tiers common equity tier 1 capital additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total onbalance sheet assets 

the federal reserve and the occ finalized a rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the basel committee known as basel ii the basel ii framework consists of three pillars a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements 

in december 2010 the basel committee issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory capital known as basel iii federal banking regulators published the united states basel iii final rule in july 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the united states basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the basel i and basel ii frameworks specifically basel iii includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets a general standardized approach and more risksensitive advanced approaches with the company’s capital adequacy being evaluated against the basel iii methodology that is most restrictive the federal reserve approved a final rule effective april 1 2014 revising the market risk capital rule which addresses the market risk of significant trading activities so that it conforms to the basel iii capital framework 

beginning january 1 2014 the regulatory capital requirements for the company follow basel iii subject to certain transition provisions from basel i over the following four years to full implementation by january 1 2018 under the united states basel iii final rule the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to rwa of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent on a fully phasedin basis in addition the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain basel i deductions be modified the company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phasedin basis by 2019 united states banking organizations are subject to a minimum leverage ratio of 40 percent the final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company 

  

to a minimum basel iii supplementary leverage ratio of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures 

the united states banking regulators also published final regulations in june 2011 implementing section 171 of the doddfrank act commonly known as the collins amendment which requires that certain institutions supervised by the federal reserve including the company be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable riskbased capital requirements prior to 2015 this minimum “capital floor” was based on basel i on january 1 2015 the united states basel iii final rule replaced the basel ibased “capital floor” with a standardized approach that among other things modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes the “capital floor” applies to the calculation of both minimum riskbased capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and if deployed the countercyclical capital buffer 

in september 2014 united states banking regulators approved a final rule that enhanced the regulatory supplementary leverage ratio “slr” requirement for banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches under basel iii the slr is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure which includes both on and offbalance sheet exposures the company began calculating and reporting its slr beginning in the first quarter of 2015 however it became subject to the minimum slr requirement on january 1 2018 at december 31 2017 the company exceeded the applicable minimum slr requirement 

in december 2017 the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework unofficially known as basel iv the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets and improve the comparability of capital ratios by a enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk b constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased “irb” approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk c introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks “gsib”s and d replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committee’s revised basel iii standardized approaches january 1 2022 is the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratio as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january 1 2022 with full implementation by january 1 2027 federal banking regulators are expected to undertake one or more rulemakings in future years to implement these revisions in the united states

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 50 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the federal reserve has issued a final rule specifying how large bank holding companies including the company should incorporate the united states basel iii capital standards into their capital plans among other things the final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital 

  

ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the united states basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

the company will submit its 2018 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5 2018 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than june 30 2018 

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early october of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of november of each year the federal reserve currently publishes summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by april 5 2018 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than june 30 2018 

basel iii liquidity requirements in 2009 the basel committee proposed two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon 

the federal banking regulators have jointly issued a final rule that implements the lcr in the united states the rule applies the lcr standards to bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company and us bank national association the lcr standards in the rule differ in certain respects from the basel committee’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions a different methodology for calculating the lcr and a shorter phasein schedule that ended on december 31 2016 in june 2016 the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement a nsfr requirement in the united states that would apply to the company and us bank national association consistent with the basel committee nsfr standard finalized in october 2014 the basel committee contemplated that the nsfr including any revisions would be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 federal banking regulators continue to work on finalizing a rule to implement the nsfr standards in the united states 

recovery plans in september 2016 the occ finalized a rule that establishes enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks insured federal savings associations and insured federal branches 

  

of foreign banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more which includes us bank national association the guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the guidelines state that a recovery plan should a establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response b identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and c address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures the board of us bank national association approved a recovery plan pursuant to these guidelines in december 2017 

supervisory ratings federal banking regulators regularly examine the company to evaluate its financial condition and monitor its compliance with laws and regulatory policies key products of such exams are supervisory ratings of the company’s overall condition commonly referred to as the camels rating for us bank national association which reflects the occ’s evaluation of certain components of the bank’s condition and the rficd rating for us bancorp which reflects the federal reserve’s evaluation of certain components of the holding company’s condition these ratings are considered to be confidential supervisory information and disclosure to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings could limit the company’s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments affect us bank national association’s deposit insurance assessment rate and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the company in august 2017 the federal reserve proposed a new supervisory rating system that would govern the federal reserve’s supervision of all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and united states intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations as well as certain savings and loan holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more under the proposal ratings would be assigned for each of three component categories a capital planning and positions b liquidity risk management and positions and c governance and controls however no composite rating would be assigned and this proposal is still under consideration 

in august 2017 the federal reserve also issued proposed guidance with respect to its expectations regarding the supervisory role of boards of directors of large financial institutions in addition in january 2018 the federal reserve made a proposal relating to the supervisory responsibilities of members of senior and business line management for risk management and controls at large financial institutions both of these proposals are meant to set regulatory expectations for the “governance and controls” component of the new rating system that has been proposed by the federal reserve 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the united states basel iii final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new basel iii capital ratios this aspect of the united states basel iii rule became effective on january 1 2015 the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding 

  

company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by us bank national association in 2014 the fdic adopted a final rule revising its deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that became effective in 2015 with additional revisions to become effective in 2018 the rule a revises the ratios and ratio thresholds relating to capital evaluations b revises the assessment base calculation for custodial banks and c requires that all highly complex institutions measure counterparty exposure for assessment purposes using the basel iii standardized approach in the regulatory capital rules 

in march 2016 in order to bring the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent the fdic finalized a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more the surcharges were first imposed in the third quarter of 2016 the calendar quarter after the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund first reached or exceeded 115 percent the surcharge imposed on each insured depository institution equals an annual rate of 45 basis points applied to the institution’s assessment base with certain adjustments the fdic expects that these surcharges should be sufficient to raise the reserve ratio to 135 percent in approximately eight quarters ie before the end of 2018 if contrary to the fdic’s expectations the reserve ratio does not reach 135 percent by december 31 2018 the fdic plans to impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more on march 31 2019 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution 

  

orderly liquidation authority the doddfrank act created a new framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the fdic as receiver a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository institution in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts plans must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan ie the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner plans must typically be updated annually 

the fdic has also adopted regulations under its own authority requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors 

the company filed its doddfrank act resolution plan in december 2017 and will periodically revise its resolution plans as required under each rule 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with us bank national association under the federal reserve act and regulation w us bank national association and its subsidiaries is subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates additionally transactions between us bank national association and its nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm’s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness

as implemented by federal banking and securities regulators and the department of the treasury aml laws obligate depository institutions and brokerdealers to verify their customers’ identity conduct customer due diligence report on suspicious activity file reports of transactions in currency and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts sanctions laws prohibit persons of the united states from engaging in any transaction with a restricted person or restricted country depository institutions and brokerdealers are required by their respective federal regulators to maintain policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the above obligations federal regulators regularly examine bsaantimoney laundering “aml” and sanctions compliance programs to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness and the frequency and extent of such examinations and the remedial actions resulting therefrom have been increasing 

noncompliance with sanctions laws andor aml laws or failure to maintain an adequate bsaaml compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger acquisition restructuring or other expansionary activity there have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banks brokerdealers and nonbank financial institutions with respect to sanctions laws and aml laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties including against the company and us bank national association see note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2017 annual report

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive the company competes with other commercial banks savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions investment companies credit card companies and a variety of other financial services advisory and technology companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

government policies 

the operations of the company’s various operating units are affected by federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities including those of the numerous states in which they operate the united states and foreign governments these policies include for example statutory maximum legal lending rates domestic monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” united states fiscal policy international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies 

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

  

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

general as a bank holding company the company is subject to regulation under the bank holding company act the “bhc act” and to inspection examination and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” us bank national association and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the fdic the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” in certain areas 

supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association the company and the company’s nonbank affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 

doddfrank act substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

the doddfrank act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports that will continue over the next several years among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes some of which are discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on the size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

bank holding company activities the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba qualifying bank holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and 

  

managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below 

us bank national association received a “satisfactory” cra rating in its most recent examination covering the period from january 1 2009 through december 31 2011 the occ has scheduled a cra examination in 2017 

source of strength the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standards in march 2014 the federal reserve finalized a rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the rule incorporates the requirement that the federal reserve conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the rule provides for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

occ heightened standards in september 2014 the occ under separate authority finalized guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation 

  

with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the 

  

following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns eg declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

the supervisory stress tests of the company conducted by the federal reserve as part of its annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process also affect the ability of the company to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” and “stress testing” below 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements have changed significantly as a result of standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” an international organization that has the goal of creating standards for banking regulation and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the doddfrank act by banking regulators in the united states minimum regulatory capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in 

prior to 2014 regulatory capital requirements effective for the company followed the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee known as basel i in implementing basel i federal banking regulators adopted riskbased capital and leverage rules that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” under the rules capital is divided into multiple tiers common equity tier 1 capital additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total onbalance sheet assets 

the federal reserve and the occ approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the basel committee known as basel ii the basel ii framework consists of three pillars a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements in december 2010 the basel committee issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory capital known as basel iii federal banking regulators published the united states basel iii final rule in july 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the united states basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the basel i and basel ii frameworks specifically basel iii includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets a general standardized approach and more risksensitive advanced approaches with the company’s capital adequacy being evaluated against the basel iii methodology that is most restrictive in december 2013 the federal reserve approved a final rule to revise the market risk capital rule which addresses the market risk of significant trading activities so that it conforms to the basel iii capital framework the revised market risk capital rule was effective april 1 2014 

  

beginning january 1 2014 the regulatory capital requirements for the company follow basel iii subject to certain transition provisions from basel i over the following four years to full implementation by january 1 2018 under the united states basel iii final rule the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to rwa of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent on a fully phasedin basis in addition the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain basel i deductions be modified the company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phasedin basis by 2019 united states banking organizations are subject to a minimum leverage ratio of 40 percent the final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company to a minimum basel iii supplementary leverage ratio of 30 percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures 

the united states banking regulators also published final regulations in june 2011 implementing section 171 of the doddfrank act commonly known as the collins amendment which requires that certain institutions supervised by the federal reserve including the company be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable riskbased capital requirements prior to 2015 this minimum “capital floor” was based on basel i on january 1 2015 the united states basel iii final rule replaced the basel ibased “capital floor” with a standardized approach that among other things modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes the “capital floor” applies to the calculation of both minimum riskbased capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and if deployed the countercyclical capital buffer

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 50 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the federal reserve has issued a final rule specifying how large bank holding companies including the company should incorporate the united states basel iii capital standards into their capital plans among other things the final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the united states basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

the company will submit its 2017 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5 2017 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the 

  

results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than june 30 2017 

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early october of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of november of each year the federal reserve currently publishes summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by april 5 2017 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than june 30 2017 

basel iii liquidity requirements the basel committee proposed in 2009 two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon 

in october 2014 the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the lcr in the united states the rule applies the lcr standards to bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company and us bank national association the lcr standards in the rule differ in certain respects from the basel committee’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions a different methodology for calculating the lcr and a shorter phasein schedule that ended on december 31 2016 in june 2016 the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement a nsfr requirement in the united states that would apply to the company and us bank national association consistent with the basel committee nsfr standard finalized in october 2014 the basel committee contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the united states basel iii 

  

final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new basel iii capital ratios this aspect of the united states basel iii rule became effective on january 1 2015 the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by us bank national association in 2014 the fdic adopted a final rule revising its deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that are effective in 2015 and 2018 the rule a revises the ratios and ratio thresholds relating to capital evaluations b revises the assessment base calculation for custodial banks and c requires that all highly complex institutions measure counterparty exposure for assessment purposes using the basel iii standardized approach in the regulatory capital rules 

in march 2016 in order to bring the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent the fdic finalized a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more the surcharges were first imposed in the third quarter of 2016 the calendar quarter after the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund first reached or exceeded 115 percent the surcharge imposed on each insured depository institution equals an annual rate of 45 basis points applied to the institution’s assessment base with certain adjustments the fdic expects that these surcharges should be sufficient to raise the reserve ratio to 135 percent in approximately eight quarters ie before the end of 2018 if contrary to the fdic’s expectations the reserve ratio does not reach 135 percent by december 31 2018 the fdic plans to impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more on march 31 2019 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of 

  

holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution 

orderly liquidation authority the doddfrank act created a new framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the fdic as receiver a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository institution in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts plans must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan ie the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner plans must typically be updated annually 

the fdic has also adopted regulations under its own authority requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors 

the company filed its resolution plans pursuant to each rule in december 2015 and will periodically revise its plans as required 

recovery plans in september 2016 the occ finalized a rule that establishes enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks insured federal savings associations and insured federal branches of foreign banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more which includes us bank national association the guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the guidelines state that a recovery plan should a establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be 

  

escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response b identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and c address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution

as implemented by federal banking and securities regulators and the department of the treasury aml laws obligate depository institutions and brokerdealers to verify their customers’ identity conduct customer due diligence report on suspicious activity file reports of transactions in currency and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts sanctions laws prohibit persons of the united states from engaging in any transaction with a restricted person or restricted country depository institutions and brokerdealers are required by their respective federal regulators to maintain policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the above obligations federal regulators regularly examine bsaaml and sanctions compliance programs to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness and the frequency and extent of such examinations and the remedial actions resulting therefrom have been increasing 

noncompliance with sanctions laws andor aml laws or failure to maintain an adequate bsaaml compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger acquisition restructuring or other expansionary activity there have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banks brokerdealers and nonbank financial institutions with respect to sanctions laws and aml laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties including criminal pleas 

community reinvestment act us bank national association is subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their communities including providing credit to individuals residing in 

  

lowincome and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner consistent with the cra

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of 

  

depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

doddfrank act substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

the doddfrank act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports that will continue over the next several years among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes some of which are discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on the size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

federal reserve regulation the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” that permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries us bank national association is regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the federal reserve and the fdic in certain areas supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association and in some cases the company and the company’s nonbank affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible 

  

business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2015 us bank national association met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standards in march 2014 the federal reserve finalized a rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the rule incorporates the requirement that the federal reserve conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the rule provides for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

occ heightened standards in september 2014 the occ under separate authority finalized guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the dodd 

  

frank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns eg declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

  

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

the supervisory stress tests of the company conducted by the federal reserve as part of its annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process also affect the ability of the company to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” and “stress testing” below 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements have changed significantly as a result of standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” an international organization that has the goal of creating standards for banking regulation and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the doddfrank act by banking regulators in the united states minimum regulatory capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in 

prior to 2014 regulatory capital requirements effective for the company followed the 1988 capital accord of the bcbs known as basel i in implementing basel i federal banking regulators adopted riskbased capital and leverage rules that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” under the rules capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total onbalance sheet assets 

the federal reserve and the occ approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the bcbs known as basel ii the basel ii framework consists of three pillars a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements in december 2010 the bcbs issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory capital known as basel iii federal banking regulators published the us basel iii final rule in july 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the us basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the basel i and basel ii frameworks specifically basel iii includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets a general standardized approach and more risksensitive advanced approaches with the company’s capital adequacy being evaluated against the basel iii methodology that is most restrictive in december 2013 the federal reserve approved a final rule to revise the market risk capital rule which addresses the market risk of significant trading activities so that it conforms to the basel iii capital framework the revised market risk capital rule was effective april 1 2014 

beginning january 1 2014 the regulatory capital requirements for the company follow basel iii subject to certain transition provisions from basel i over the following four years to full implementation by january 1 2018 under the us basel iii final rule the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to rwa of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 60 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 80 percent on a fully phasedin basis in addition the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain basel i deductions be modified the 

  

company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phasedin basis by 2019 the us basel iii final rule establishes a minimum leverage ratio of 40 percent for all us banking organizations the final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company to a minimum basel iii supplementary leverage ratio of 30 percent that takes into account certain offbalance sheet exposures 

the us banking regulators also published final regulations in june 2011 implementing the collins amendment to the doddfrank act which requires that certain institutions supervised by the federal reserve including the company be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable riskbased capital requirements prior to 2015 this minimum “capital floor” was based on basel i on january 1 2015 the us basel iii final rule replaced the basel ibased “capital floor” with a standardized approach that among other things modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes the “capital floor” applies to the calculation of both minimum riskbased capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and if deployed the countercyclical capital buffer 

in september 2014 us banking regulators approved a final rule that enhanced the regulatory supplemental leverage ratio “slr” requirement for banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches under basel iii the slr is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure which includes both on and offbalance sheet exposures the company began calculating and reporting its slr beginning in the first quarter of 2015 however it is not subject to the minimum slr requirement until january 1 2018 at december 31 2015 the company exceeds the applicable minimum slr requirement 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see “capital management” in the company’s 2015 annual report on pages 6567 

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 50 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the federal reserve has issued a final rule specifying how large bank holding companies including the company should incorporate the us basel iii capital standards into their capital plans among other things the final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the us basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

the company will submit its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5 2016 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than june 30 2016 

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve 

  

and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large us bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june 30 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early july of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of september of each year the federal reserve currently publishes summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by april 5 2016 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than june 30 2016 

basel iii liquidity proposals the bcbs proposed in 2009 two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon 

in october 2014 the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the lcr in the united states the rule applies the lcr standards to bank holding companies and their us bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company and us bank national association the lcr standards in the rule differ in certain respects from the bcbs’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions a different methodology for calculating the lcr and a shorter phasein schedule that ends on december 31 2016 the federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the nsfr in the united states the bcbs however finalized the nsfr standard in october 2014 and us regulators are expected to use this framework as a basis for domestic regulation the bcbs contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the us basel iii final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new basel iii capital ratios this aspect of the us basel iii rule became effective on january 1 2015 the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required 

  

to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by us bank national association in 2014 the fdic adopted a final rule revising its deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that are effective in 2015 and 2018 the rule a revises the ratios and ratio thresholds relating to capital evaluations b revises the assessment base calculation for custodial banks and c requires that all highly complex institutions measure counterparty exposure for assessment purposes using the basel iii standardized approach in the regulatory capital rules 

in november 2015 in order to bring the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 135 percent the fdic proposed a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more the proposed surcharges would be imposed the calendar quarter after the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund first reaches or exceeds 115 percent and would continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 135 percent the surcharge imposed on each insured depository institution would equal an annual rate of 45 basis points applied to the institution’s assessment base with certain adjustments the fdic expects that these surcharges will commence in 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the reserve ratio to 135 percent in approximately eight quarters ie before the end of 2018 if contrary to the fdic’s expectations the reserve ratio does not reach 135 percent by december 31 2018 the fdic plans to impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more on march 31 2019 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository 

  

orderly liquidation authority the doddfrank act created a new framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the fdic as receiver a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository institution in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts plans must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan ie the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner plans must be updated annually 

in january 2012 the fdic adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors 

the company filed its resolution plans pursuant to each rule in december 2015 and will periodically revise its plans as required 

recovery plans in december 2015 the occ proposed a rule to establish enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks insured federal savings associations and insured federal branches of foreign banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more us bank national association would be a “covered bank” under this rule and would be required to develop and maintain a recovery plan the proposed guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile size activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure the proposed guidelines state that a recovery plan should a establish triggers which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors as appropriate for purposes of initiating a response b identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability and c address escalation procedures management reports and communication procedures 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution 

  

under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from us bank national association under the federal reserve act and regulation w of the federal reserve us bank national association and its subsidiaries may only engage in lending and other “covered transactions” with nonbank and nonsavings bank affiliates to the following extent a in the case of any single affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of us bank national association and b in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of us bank national association 

covered transactions between us bank national association and its affiliates are also subject to certain collateralization requirements all covered transactions including transactions with a third party in which an affiliate of us bank national association has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms “covered transactions” are defined to include a a loan or extension of credit by a bank subsidiary to an affiliate b a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary by an affiliate c a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve by the banking subsidiary from an affiliate d the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan and e the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate the doddfrank act eliminated the special treatment for transactions with financial subsidiaries and added derivative and securities lending transactions to the definition of “covered transactions”

community reinvestment act us bank national association is subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound 

  

operation to help meet the credit needs of their communities including providing credit to individuals residing in lowincome and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner consistent with the cra 

the occ regularly assesses us bank national association on its record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including lowincome and moderateincome neighborhoods the assessment also is considered when the federal reserve reviews applications by banking institutions to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company and those records may be the basis for denying the application

in addition in october 2015 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the federal housing finance agency and the farm credit administration finalized a rule concerning swap margin and capital requirements the rule incorporates many aspects of the international framework for margin requirements for noncentrally cleared derivatives issued in september 2013 by the bcbs and the board of the international organization of securities commissions the final rule mandates the exchange of initial and variation margin for noncleared swaps and noncleared securitybased swaps between swap entities regulated by the five agencies and certain 

  

counterparties the amount of margin will vary based on the relative risk of the noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap the final rule will phase in the variation margin requirements between september 1 2016 and march 1 2017 the initial margin requirements will phase in over four years beginning on september 1 2016 additionally the agencies issued an interim final rule relating to the rule’s exemption from margin requirements for certain noncleared swaps and noncleared securitybased swaps used for hedging purposes by commercial endusers and certain other counterparties 

other swaps requirements have been modified by legislation section 716 of the doddfrank act required covered us banks acting as dealers in commodity swaps equity swaps and certain credit default swaps to “push out” such activities and conduct them through one or more nonbank affiliates in december 2014 the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 was signed into law which contains a provision that narrows the pushout requirements in section 716 only to “structured finance swaps” 

future regulations will likely impose additional operational and compliance costs although the ultimate impact of regulations that have not yet been finalized remains unclear 

the volcker rule in december 2013 the sec the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly issued a final rule to implement the socalled “volcker rule” under the doddfrank act the volcker rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and prohibits certain interests in or relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds the final rule also requires annual attestation by a banking entity’s chief executive officer that the banking entity has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify a compliance program established in a manner reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the final rule the final rule became effective on april 1 2014 and applies to the company us bank national association and their affiliates

durbin amendment a provision of the doddfrank act known as the durbin amendment required the federal reserve to establish a cap on the interchange fees that merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions the federal reserve issued final rules effective october 1 2011 for establishing standards including a cap for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions the final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions and it established a maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction which reduces fee revenue to debit card issuers such as the company under the final rule the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 

in july 2013 the united states district court for the district of columbia in nacs et al v board of governors of the federal reserve system  invalidated these regulations ruling in favor of a group of retailers 

  

who argued that the new lower interchange fees had been inappropriately set too high the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in march 2014 reversed the district court upheld the vast majority of the regulations and remanded the matter to the district court for the limited purpose of reviewing the federal reserve’s treatment of transaction monitoring costs in january 2015 the supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision which effectively keeps the final interchange fees rules intact

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive us bank national association competes with other commercial banks savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions investment companies credit card companies and a variety of other financial services advisory and technology companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services 

  

offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

government policies 

the operations of the company’s various operating units are affected by federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities including those of the numerous states in which they operate the united states and foreign governments these policies include for example statutory maximum legal lending rates domestic monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” united states fiscal policy international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies 

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

doddfrank act substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

the doddfrank act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports that will continue over the next several years among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes some of which are discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

federal reserve regulation the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” that permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries us bank national association is regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and 

  

also by the federal reserve and the fdic in certain areas supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association and in some cases the company and the company’s nonbank affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2014 us bank national association met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standards in march 2014 the federal reserve finalized a rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the rule incorporates the requirement that the federal reserve conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the rule provides for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

  

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation 

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

  

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns eg declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

the supervisory stress tests of the company conducted by the federal reserve as part of its annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process also affect the ability of the company to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” and “stress testing” below 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements have changed significantly as a result of standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” an international organization which has the goal of creating standards for banking regulation and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the doddfrank act by banking regulators in the united states minimum regulatory capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in 

prior to 2014 regulatory capital requirements effective for the company followed the 1988 capital accord of the bcbs known as basel i in implementing basel i federal banking regulators adopted riskbased capital and leverage rules that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” under the rules capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total onbalance sheet assets 

the federal reserve and the occ approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the bcbs known as basel ii the basel ii framework consists of three pillars a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements in december 2010 the bcbs issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory capital known as basel iii the us federal banking regulators published the us basel iii final rule in october 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the us basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the existing basel i and basel ii frameworks specifically basel iii includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets a general standardized approach and more risksensitive advanced approaches as of april 1 2014 the company exited its parallel run qualification period resulting in its capital adequacy now being evaluated against the basel iii methodology that is most restrictive previously the company was required to calculate its capital adequacy under basel iii using the standardized approach only 

  

beginning january 1 2014 the regulatory capital requirements for the company follow basel iii subject to certain transition provisions from basel i over the following four years to full implementation by january 1 2018 under the us basel iii final rule the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to rwa of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 8 percent on a fully phasedin basis in addition the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain basel i deductions be modified the company is also subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phasedin basis by 2019 the us basel iii final rule establishes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all us banking organizations the final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company to a minimum basel iii supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent that takes into account certain offbalance sheet exposures 

the us banking regulators also published final regulations in june 2011 implementing the collins amendment to the doddfrank act which requires that certain institutions supervised by the federal reserve including the company be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable riskbased capital requirements prior to 2015 this minimum “capital floor” was based on basel i on january 1 2015 the us basel iii final rule replaced the current basel ibased “capital floor” with a standardized approach that among other things modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes the “capital floor” applies to the calculation of both minimum riskbased capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and if deployed the countercyclical capital buffer 

in september 2014 us banking regulators approved a final rule that enhanced the regulatory supplemental leverage ratio “slr” requirement for banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches under basel iii the slr is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure which includes both on and offbalance sheet exposures the company is required to calculate and report its slr beginning in the first quarter of 2015 however the company is not subject to the minimum slr requirement until january 1 2018 the company believes it currently exceeds the applicable minimum slr requirement 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see capital management in the company’s 2014 annual report on pages 6365 

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan these capital plans consists of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the federal reserve has issued a final rule specifying how large bank holding companies including the company should incorporate the us basel iii capital standards into their capital plans among other things the final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the us basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

the company submitted its 2015 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 5 2015 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than march 31 2015 

  

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large us bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than march 31 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early july of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of september of each year in 2014 the federal reserve began publishing summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association submitted its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements on january 5 2015 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than march 31 2015 

in october 2014 the federal reserve promulgated new rules that beginning in 2016 require participating bank holding companies to submit their capital plans and stress testing results on or before april 5 the occ adopted a final rule in december 2014 with the same reporting deadline of april 5 for companyrun stress test results 

basel iii liquidity proposals the bcbs proposed in 2009 two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon 

in october 2014 the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the lcr in the united states the rule applies the lcr standards to bank holding companies and their us bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company and us bank national association the lcr standards in the rule differ in certain respects from the bcbs’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions a different methodology for calculating the lcr and a shorter phasein schedule that ends on december 31 2016 the federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the nsfr in the united states the bcbs however finalized the nsfr standard in october 2014 and us regulators are expected to use this framework as a basis for domestic regulation in the coming months the bcbs contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

  

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the us basel iii final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new basel iii capital ratios this aspect of the us basel iii rule became effective on january 1 2015 the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the deposit insurance reserve fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by us bank national association in 2014 the fdic adopted a final rule revising its deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that go into effect in 2015 and 2018 the rule a revises the ratios and ratio thresholds relating to capital evaluations b revises the assessment base calculation for custodial banks and c requires that all highly complex institutions measure counterparty exposure for assessment purposes using the basel iii standardized approach in the regulatory capital rules 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository 

orderly liquidation authority the doddfrank act created a new framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the fdic as receiver a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository institution in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after 

  

consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic in preparation for the potential exercise of this authority the fdic created the office of complex financial institutions its duties include the continuous review and oversight of bank holding companies with assets of more than 100 billion 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts plans must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan ie the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner plans must be updated annually 

in january 2012 the fdic adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors 

the company filed its resolution plan pursuant to each rule in december 2014 and will periodically revise its plan as required 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution

in addition in september 2014 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the federal housing finance agency and the farm credit administration issued a joint proposal concerning swap margin and capital requirements the reproposed rule supersedes the agencies’ previous proposal issued in april 2011 and incorporates many aspects of the international framework for margin requirements for noncentrally cleared derivatives issued in september 2013 by the bcbs and the board of the international organization of securities commissions if adopted the proposed rule would require swap entities regulated by the five agencies to collect minimum amounts of initial margin and variation margin from counterparties to noncleared swaps and noncleared securitybased swaps

in july 2013 the united states district court for the district of columbia in nacs et al v board of governors of the federal reserve system  invalidated these regulations ruling in favor of a group of retailers who argued that the new lower interchange fees had been inappropriately set too high the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in march 2014 reversed the district court upheld the vast majority of the regulations and remanded the matter to the district court for the limited purpose of reviewing the federal reserve’s treatment of transaction monitoring costs in january 2015 the supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision which effectively keeps the final interchange fees rules intact

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive us bank national association competes with other commercial banks and with other financial institutions including savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions and investment companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

  

government policies 

the operations of the company’s various operating units are affected by federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities including those of the numerous states in which they operate the united states and foreign governments these policies include for example statutory maximum legal lending rates domestic monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” united states fiscal policy international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies 

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers and the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

doddfrank act the doddfrank act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports that will continue over the next several years among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes some of which are discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

federal reserve regulation the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” that permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glba’s system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries us bank national association is regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the federal reserve and the fdic in certain areas supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities us bank national association and in some cases the company and the company’s nonbank 

  

affiliates must undergo regular onsite examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities if they deem the company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2013 us bank national association met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to us bank national association and to commit resources to support this subsidiariy in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standardsearly remediation in 2011 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the proposal requires the federal reserve to conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the proposal would provide for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

the proposed rule also provides as required by the doddfrank act for the early remediation of financial distress at covered companies so as to minimize the probability that the company will become insolvent and to reduce the potential harm of the insolvency of a covered company to the financial stability of the united states remedies include in the initial stages of financial decline of the covered company limits on capital distributions 

  

acquisitions and asset growth remedies in the later stages of financial decline of the covered company include a capital restoration plan and capitalraising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in addition to regulatory capital triggers the proposed rule includes triggers based on supervisory stress test results market indicators and weaknesses in enterprisewide and liquidity risk management 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well capitalized and well managed institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatorilydefined periods 

  

the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for well capitalized and well managed holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns eg declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

the supervisory stress tests of the company conducted by the federal reserve as part of its annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process also affect the ability of the company to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution see “comprehensive capital analysis and review” and “stress testing” below 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements the basel i or general riskbased capital rules established by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements are currently the subject of significant changes as a result of standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” an international organization which has the goal of creating international standards for banking regulation and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the doddfrank act by banking regulators in the united states minimum regulatory capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in 

federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage rules that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” 

under the rules capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the existing basel i rules banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital 

  

to rwa of 8 percent and a tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital to rwa of 4 percent at december 31 2013 under the basel i rules the company’s consolidated total capital ratio was 132 percent and its tier 1 capital ratio was 112 percent for a further description see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s 2013 annual report 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total onbalance sheet assets under the existing rules the minimum leverage ratio is 3 percent for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans at december 31 2013 the company’s leverage ratio was 96 percent 

the doddfrank act effectively eliminated differences between the minimum capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions and their holding companies by phasing out the use of hybrid debt instruments such as trust preferred securities in determining holding company regulatory capital 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see capital management in the company’s 2013 annual report on page 58 

basel ii and iii the federal reserve and the occ approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the bcbs known as “basel ii” the basel ii framework consists of three pillars a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements the company began the parallel run phase of its basel ii implementation process in 2011 the company must complete the parallel run to the satisfaction of the federal reserve and the occ before it may use the basel ii advanced approaches to calculate its riskbased capital requirements 

in december 2010 the bcbs issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory capital known as basel iii the us federal banking regulators published the us basel iii final rule in october 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the us basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the existing basel i and basel ii frameworks under the us basel iii final rule the company will be subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio common equity tier 1 capital to rwa of 45 percent a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 8 percent on a fully phasedin basis in addition the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain basel i deductions be modified the majority of these capital deductions are subject to a phasein schedule and will be fully phased in by 2018 the company will also be subject to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and if deployed up to a 25 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phasedin basis by 2019 the us basel iii final rule establishes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all us banking organizations the final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches including the company to a minimum basel iii supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent that takes into account certain offbalance sheet exposures the company became subject to the us basel iii final rule beginning on january 1 2014 certain requirements in the us basel iii final rule including the new capital buffers will be phased in over several years 

in june 2011 the us banking regulators published final regulations implementing a provision of the doddfrank act requiring that certain institutions supervised by the federal reserve including the company be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable riskbased capital requirements currently this minimum “capital floor” is based on basel i beginning on january 1 2015 the us basel iii final rule will replace the current basel ibased “capital floor” with a standardized approach that 

  

among other things modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes the “capital floor” applies to the calculation of both minimum riskbased capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and if deployed the countercyclical capital buffer 

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions proposed in the capital plan these capital plans consists of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of a company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of a company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the federal reserve has issued an interim final rule specifying how large bank holding companies including the company should incorporate the us basel iii capital standards into their 2014 capital plan among other things the interim final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the us basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

the company submitted its 2014 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 6 2014 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than march 31 2014 

stress testing the federal reserve’s ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the company to conduct companyrun stress tests and subjects them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large us bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserve’s ccar and doddfrank supervisory stress tests incorporate the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests respectively no later than march 31 of each year in addition all large bank holding companies are required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early july of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of september of each year the federal reserve has stated that in 2014 it plans to publish summaries of supervisory stress test results for each large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the federal reserve 

national banks with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit annual companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding company’s ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserve’s stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario us bank national association submitted its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements in january 2014 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than march 31 2014 

  

basel iii liquidity proposals the bcbs proposed in 2009 two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon the bcbs contemplates that bank regulators in major jurisdictions will begin to phase in the lcr requirement on january 1 2015 it contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 

in october 2013 the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement the lcr in the united states the proposed rule would apply the lcr standards to bank holding companies and their us bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches such as the company and us bank national association the lcr standards in the proposed rule differ in certain respects from the bcbs’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions a different methodology for calculating the lcr and a shorter phasein schedule that ends on december 31 2016 the federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the nsfr in the united states 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the us basel iii final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new basel iii capital ratios this aspect of the us basel iii rule will become effective on january 1 2015 the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the deposit insurance reserve fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by us bank national association 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the 

  

power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiary us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those noteholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository 

orderly liquidation authority the doddfrank act created a new framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the fdic as receiver a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository institution in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic in preparation for the potential exercise of this authority the fdic created the office of complex financial institutions its duties include the continuous review and oversight of bank holding companies with assets of more than 100 billion 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts the plan must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan ie the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner plans must be updated annually 

in january 2012 the fdic adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors 

the company filed its initial resolution plan pursuant to each rule in december 2013 and will periodically revise its plan as required

in july 2013 a decision by a washington dc district court judge invalidated the federal reserve’s interchange fee rule ruling in favor of a group of retailers who argued that the new lower interchange fees had been inappropriately set too high by the federal reserve if upheld the decision would keep in place current interchange transaction standards until new regulations or interim standards are implemented the federal reserve has appealed the decision and a stay is in effect if the rule were to be revised so that the cap on interchange fees were even lower it could adversely impact the company’s debit interchange fee revenue the final impact of the court decision will depend on factors such as the outcome of the appeal and the provisions of any new or revised regulations that are promulgated

the cfpb recently finalized a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage these rules implement the doddfrank act amendments to the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act the final rules require banks to among other things a develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” requirement and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” b implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence c comply with additional rules and restrictions regarding mortgage loan originator compensation and the qualification and registration or licensing of loan originators and d comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for “higher priced mortgage loans” some of these new rules became effective in june 2013 while others became effective in january 2014 and additional forthcoming rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business is also expected

managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2012 the company’s depositoryinstitution subsidiaries met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standardsearly remediation in 2011 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the proposal requires the federal reserve to conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the proposal would provide for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

the proposed rule also provides as required by the doddfrank act for the early remediation of financial distress at covered companies so as to minimize the probability that the company will become insolvent and to reduce the potential harm of the insolvency of a covered company to the financial stability of the united states remedies include in the initial stages of financial decline of the covered company limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth remedies in the later stages of financial decline of the covered company include a capital restoration plan and capitalraising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in addition to regulatory capital triggers the proposed rule includes triggers based on supervisory stress test results market indicators and weaknesses in enterprisewide and liquidity risk management 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies 

  

insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well capitalized and well managed institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association its principal banking subsidiary federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

dividends payable by us bank national association us bank national association nd and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company’s 2012 annual report for the amount of dividends that the company’s principal banking subsidiaries could pay to the company at december 31 2012 without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve and the fdic have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and its bank subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to 

  

exceptions for well capitalized and well managed holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns eg declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

capital requirements the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements the basel i or general riskbased capital rules established by the federal reserve and the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to substantially similar rules established by the occ these requirements are currently the subject of significant changes as a result of the basel capital proposals and the implementation of these proposals by banking regulators in the united states regulatory capital requirements will also change due to implementation of the provisions of the doddfrank act minimum regulatory capital levels are expected to significantly increase as these requirements are adopted and implemented 

federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into risk weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” 

under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to rwa of 8 percent and a tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital to rwa of 4 percent at december 31 2012 the company’s consolidated total capital ratio was 131 percent and its tier 1 capital ratio was 108 percent for a further description of these guidelines see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s 2012 annual report 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 percent for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans at december 31 2012 the company’s leverage ratio was 92 percent 

the doddfrank act effectively eliminated differences between the minimum capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions and their holding companies by phasing out the use of hybrid debt instruments such as trust preferred securities in determining holding company regulatory capital

basel ii and iii the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” is an international organization which has the goal of creating international standards for banking regulation the federal reserve and the occ approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the bcbs known as “basel ii” basel ii established three guiding principles a capital adequacy b supervisory review including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline including increased disclosure requirements the company began the parallel run phase of its basel ii implementation process in 2011 the company must complete the parallel run to the satisfaction of the federal reserve and the occ before it may use the basel ii advanced approaches to calculate its riskbased capital requirements 

in december 2010 the bcbs issued a new set of international guidelines for determining regulatory capital known as “basel iii” these guidelines were revised in june 2011 the basel iii capital guidelines increase minimum capital requirements and when fully implemented will require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets of at least 45 percent plus a 25 percent capital conservation buffer 

the federal reserve and the occ issued three notices of proposed rulemaking in june 2012 the “basel iii nprs” that would revise the regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements for banks in the united states consistent with the bcbs proposals the proposed revisions include the implementation of a more conservative definition of capital a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement and a supplementary leverage ratio also consistent with basel iii the federal reserve and the occ have proposed limiting capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executives if banks do not maintain specified capital buffers in addition to meeting minimum riskbased capital requirements in addition the regulators have proposed to revise the calculation of riskweighted assets under the general riskbased capital rule applicable to all banks and the calculation of the basel ii advanced approach riskbased capital rules both of which apply to the company 

the basel iii nprs provided for an implementation date of january 1 2013 and a transition period extending to 2019 however the regulators have delayed the finalization of the proposals at present there is no indication from the federal reserve and the occ as to when the final rules will be published or the implications that this delay will have on implementation or the transition period 

comprehensive capital analysis and review the federal reserve’s capital plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of 50 billion to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the federal reserve for capital distributions projected in the capital plan the comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” of the company’s capital plan consists of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of the company’s sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of the company’s process for assessing capital adequacy a demonstration of the company’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 percent under expected and stressful conditions and a demonstration of the company’s ability to achieve readily and without difficulty the capital ratios required by the basel iii framework as it comes into effect in the united states 

the company submitted its 2013 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 6 2013 in accordance with instructions from the federal reserve applicable stress testing rules require the federal reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the company’s capital plan including its planned capital distributions no later than march 31 2013 

stress testing the stress testing required as part of the ccar process includes companyrun stress tests employing stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal 

  

reserve the company also submits stress tests incorporating the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across bank holding companies the federal reserve also conducts a supervisory stress test employing its severely adverse stress scenario and its internal supervisory models which incorporates both the company’s planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions the federal reserve and the company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual companyrun stress tests for severely adverse scenarios only respectively no later than march 31 of each year in addition to the stress tests produced in connection with the ccar all large bank holding companies are also required to submit a midcycle companyrun stress test based on stress scenarios developed by the company the results of this stress test must be submitted to the federal reserve for review in early july of each year the company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of september of each year 

depository institutions with assets in excess of 50 billion are required to submit an annual companyrun stress test which runs concurrently with and is submitted at the same time as the ccar the stress test is based on the occ’s stress scenario assumptions and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario the company’s principal banking subsidiary us bank national association submitted its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements in january 2013 the company is required to publish the results of this stress test no later than march 31 2013 

basel iii liquidity proposals the bcbs proposed in 2009 two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon in january 2012 the bcbs further revised the proposals and delayed the implementation date to january 1 2015 the requirements would be phased in over the next four succeeding years domestic regulators are expected to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking defining the lcr and nsfr for united states implementation sometime in the future 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the deposit insurance reserve fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

  

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 and extended the unlimited insurance of noninterest bearing transaction accounts under the fdic transaction account guaranty program to january 1 2013 in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the doddfrank act provisions which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was to increase the fdic premiums paid by the company’s banking subsidiaries 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those noteholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository 

orderly liquidation authority in 2011 under the doddfrank act the fdic adopted a rule providing for a comprehensive framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the impact of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic in preparation for the potential exercise of this authority the fdic created the office of complex financial institutions its duties include the continuous review and oversight of bank holding companies with assets of more than 100 billion 

resolution plans the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted a rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more socalled “living wills” the rule requires each covered company to produce a resolution plan that includes information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts the plan must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan 

in january 2012 the fdic adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in 

  

the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the company will be required to file both resolution plans in december 2013 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from the company’s banking subsidiaries including us bank national association and us bank national association nd under the federal reserve act and regulation w of the federal reserve the company’s banking subsidiaries and their subsidiaries may only engage in lending and other “covered transactions” with nonbank and nonsavings bank affiliates to the following extent a in the case of any single affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary and b in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary 

covered transactions between the company’s banking subsidiaries and their affiliates are also subject to certain collateralization requirements all covered transactions including transactions with a third party in which an affiliate of the banking subsidiary has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms “covered transactions” are defined to include a a loan or extension of credit by a bank subsidiary to an affiliate b a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary by an affiliate c a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve by the banking subsidiary from an affiliate d the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan and e the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate the doddfrank act eliminated the special treatment for transactions with financial subsidiaries and added derivative and securities lending transactions to the definition of “covered transactions” 

antimoney laundering and suspicious activity several federal laws including the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “patriot act” require all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things implement policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

community reinvestment act the company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra the banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner consistent with the cra 

the occ regularly assesses each of the company’s banking subsidiaries on its record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including lowincome and moderateincome neighborhoods 

  

the assessment also is considered when the federal reserve reviews applications by banking institutions to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company and those records may be the basis for denying the application

competition 

the commercial banking business is highly competitive the company’s subsidiary banks compete with other commercial banks and with other financial institutions including savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions and investment companies in recent years competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs 

government policies 

the operations of the company’s various operating units are affected by federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities including those of the numerous states in which they operate the united states and foreign governments these policies include for example statutory maximum 

  

legal lending rates domestic monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system united states fiscal policy international currency regulations and monetary policies the us patriot act and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies 

supervision and regulation 

us bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” consumers and the stability of the financial system in the united states and the health of the national economy and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

this section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below 

substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the company and its subsidiaries 

doddfrank act the doddfrank act which was enacted into law on july 21 2010 significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies and requires significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports over the next several years among other things it created a new financial stability oversight council the “council” with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain nonbank financial services companies the doddfrank act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions limits the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks increases the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and makes numerous other changes discussed below 

in addition to the doddfrank act other legislative proposals affecting banks have been made both domestically and internationally among other things these proposals include additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on size or types of activity in which banks may engage 

federal reserve regulation the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba’s system of “functional regulation” the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” acts as an “umbrella regulator” for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries the company’s banking subsidiaries are regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the federal reserve and the fdic in certain areas supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

  

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2011 the company’s depositoryinstitution subsidiaries met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

enhanced prudential standardsearly remediation in december 2011 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule relating to enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act for bank holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests the proposal requires the federal reserve to conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy stress tests of covered companies under baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests the proposal would provide for notification to a covered company as to which the council has determined to impose a debttoequity ratio of no more than 15to1 based upon the determination by the council that a such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and b the imposition of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the united states 

the proposed rule also provides as required by the doddfrank act for the early remediation of financial distress at covered companies so as to minimize the probability that the company will become insolvent and to reduce the potential harm of the insolvency of a covered company to the financial stability of the united states remedies include in the initial stages of financial decline of the covered company limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth remedies in the later stages of financial decline of the covered company include a capital restoration plan and capitalraising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in addition to regulatory capital triggers the proposed rule includes triggers based on supervisory stress test results market indicators and weaknesses in enterprisewide and liquidity risk management 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

the company generally does not need federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to 

  

activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring that approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in the other state 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well capitalized and well managed institutions 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association its principal banking subsidiary federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

dividends payable by us bank national association us bank national association nd and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company’s 2011 annual report for the amount of dividends that the company’s principal banking subsidiaries could pay to the company at december 31 2011 without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve and the fdic have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and its bank subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for well capitalized and well managed holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns  eg  declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or 

  

repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

in 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions 

capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into risk weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwas” 

under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to rwa of 8 percent and a tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital to rwa of 4 percent at december 31 2011 the company’s consolidated total capital ratio was 133 percent and its tier 1 capital ratio was 108 percent for a further description of these guidelines see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s 2011 annual report 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 percent for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans at december 31 2011 the company’s leverage ratio was 91 percent 

the doddfrank act effectively eliminated differences between the minimum capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions and their holding companies by phasing out the use of hybrid debt instruments such as trust preferred securities in determining holding company regulatory capital 

for additional information regarding the company’s regulatory capital see capital management in the company’s 2011 annual report on pages 55 to 56 

capital plan requirementminimum capital level in 2011 the federal reserve issued a final rule amending regulation y to require bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis the company submitted its first capital plan in january 2012 the federal reserve must object or provide notice of nonobjection to the plan by march 31 2012 

companies must demonstrate in their capital plans how they will maintain a minimum tier 1 common ratio above 5 percent under stressful conditions using the federal reserve’s existing supervisory definition of tier 1 common capital if the federal reserve objects to a capital plan and until such time as the federal reserve issues a nonobjection to the bank holding company’s capital plan the bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions with respect to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection 

basel iii capital requirementscapital surchargeadditional loss absorbency requirementliquidity in june 2011 the basel committee revised the new capital and liquidity standards issued in october 2010 known 

  

as basel iii as of january 1 2013 banks will be required to meet new minimum requirements in relation to rwas minimum common equity and tier 1 capital requirements will be phased in between january 1 2013 and january 1 2015 a “capital conservation buffer” will be phased in between january 1 2016 and december 31 2018 becoming fully effective on january 1 2019 

in early 2012 the federal reserve is expected to promulgate proposed rules implementing the new market risk capital requirements from the basel accords to include book securitization and resecuritization elements and to adopt the basel iii framework the federal reserve is expected to approve capital distributions only when they are consistent with a bank holding company “readily and without difficulty” meeting the new capital requirements as they come into effect 

the basel iii liquidity component sets out two minimum standards for funding liquidity the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” which is designed to promote the shortterm resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario lasting for 30 calendar days and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which is designed to promote longerterm resilience by requiring banks to have capital or longer term highquality funding so that the banks can survive over a oneyear period of less severe stress the lcr will be introduced on january 1 2015 the nsfr will move to a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve in its proposed rule for enhanced prudential standards has stated that it intends to implement these liquidity standards in the united states through one or more separate rules 

stress testing in november 2011 the federal reserve launched its comprehensive capital analysis and review process the federal reserve issued the macroeconomic and financial market scenarios it is requiring institutions to use to support the stress testing used in their capital plans institutions were required to submit their capital plans by january 9 2012 and the company did so the federal reserve will conduct a supervisory stress test for the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company to help assess the capital plans and the appropriateness of capital levels for those companies in january 2012 the occ issued a proposed rule requiring national banks with more than 10 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct a separate annual stress test to help identify potential impact of adverse outcomes on the bank’s capital adequacy 

riskbased capital standards establishment of a riskbased capital floor in june 2011 the occ the federal reserve and the fdic adopted a final rule to implement certain requirements of the doddfrank act which require these agencies to establish minimum riskbased capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions under the rule banks and bank holding companies must maintain a minimum total riskbased capital ratio of 80 percent and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 40 percent 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate 

  

a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and depleted the deposit insurance fund in addition in 2008 the amount of fdic insurance coverage for insured deposits was generally increased from 100000 per depositor account ownership type to 250000 

in light of the increased stress on the deposit insurance fund caused by these developments and in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund the fdic a imposed a special assessment in june 2009 b increased assessment rates of insured institutions generally and c required insured institutions to prepay on december 30 2009 the premiums that were expected to become due for 2010 2011 and 2012 in addition the doddfrank act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing the deposit insurance reserve fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 and extended the unlimited insurance of noninterest bearing transaction accounts under the fdic transaction account guaranty program to january 1 2013 

deposit insurance assessments in february 2011 the fdic adopted a final rule implementing revisions to the federal deposit insurance act made by the doddfrank act including a revision which changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums and which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums the effect of the rule was first reflected in the invoices for assessments due september 30 2011 and substantially increased the fdic premiums paid by the company’s banking subsidiaries 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as us bank national association 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those noteholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository 

orderly liquidation authority the fdic issued a final rule effective august 15 2011 to implement the liquidation provisions of the doddfrank act the rule provides a comprehensive framework for the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company a covered financial company is a financial company including a bank holding company but not an insured depository in situations where the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president that the conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the impact of the financial company’s failure have been met the rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company the company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic in preparation for the potential exercise of this authority the fdic created the office of complex financial institutions its duties include the continuous review and oversight of bank holding companies with assets of more than 100 billion 

  

resolution plans effective november 30 2011 the federal reserve and the fdic adopted a final rule to implement the requirements of the doddfrank act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of 50 billion or more the final rule requires each covered company to produce a resolution plan that includes information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company full descriptions of ownership structure assets liabilities and contractual obligations of the company identification of the crossguarantees tied to different securities identification of major counterparties a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged and any other information that the federal reserve and the fdic jointly require by rule or order plans must analyze baseline adverse and severely adverse economic condition impacts the plan must demonstrate in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan 

in january 2012 the fdic adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingency plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the company will be required to file both resolution plans in 2013 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from the company’s banking subsidiaries including us bank national association and us bank national association nd under the federal reserve act and regulation w of the federal reserve the company’s banking subsidiaries and their subsidiaries may only engage in lending and other “covered transactions” with nonbank and nonsavings bank affiliates to the following extent a in the case of any single affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary and b in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary 

covered transactions between the company’s banking subsidiaries and their affiliates are also subject to certain collateralization requirements all covered transactions including transactions with a third party in which an affiliate of the banking subsidiary has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms “covered transactions” are defined to include a a loan or extension of credit by a bank subsidiary to an affiliate b a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary by an affiliate c a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve by the banking subsidiary from an affiliate d the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan and e the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate the doddfrank act eliminated the special treatment for transactions with financial subsidiaries

federal reserve regulation the company elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the “glba” under the glba’s system of “functional regulation” the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” acts as an “umbrella regulator” for the company and certain of the company’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries the company’s banking subsidiaries are regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” and also by the federal reserve and the fdic in certain areas supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities 

 

if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct see “permissible business 

activities” below if the failure to meet these standards persists a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 

 

federal reserve regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage see “community reinvestment act” below at december 31 2010 the company’s depositoryinstitution subsidiaries met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the glba 

 

the doddfrank act codified existing federal reserve policy requiring the company to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so however because the glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators the glba prohibits the federal reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment in those cases the federal reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture as a result of the doddfrank act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company 

 

permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include the following securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

 

the company generally does not need federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve however the doddfrank act added a provision requiring that approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed 10 billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association 

 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state 

 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches under the doddfrank act banks are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in the other state 

 

regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the following the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the 

convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities in addition under the doddfrank act approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well capitalized and well managed institutions 

 

dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the company’s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association its principal banking subsidiary federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks 

 

dividends payable by us bank national association us bank national association nd and the company’s trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company’s 2010 annual report for the amount of dividends that the company’s principal banking subsidiaries could pay to the company at december 31 2010 without the approval of their banking regulators 

 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve and the fdic have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and its bank subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization subject to exceptions for well capitalized and well managed holding companies federal reserve regulations also require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12month period 

 

in addition federal reserve policy on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the federal reserve in advance of doing any of the following declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns  eg  declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which dividends are being paid redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs 

 

in november 2010 the federal reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies including the company that are covered by the supervisory capital assessment program “scap” the addendum provides for federal reserve review of dividend increases implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions the addendum also requires that holding companies subject to scap prepare and file a comprehensive capital plan that includes a stress testing framework these plans will be evaluated by the federal reserve based on the holding company’s risk profile currently applicable capital standards and the reasonableness of plans to address future capital standards including basel iii discussed below and relevant requirements under the doddfrank act 

 

capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the capitaltoassets ratios of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into risk weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution’s total riskweighted assets “rwa” 

 

under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to rwa of 8 percent and a tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital to rwa of 4 percent at december 31 2010 the company’s 

consolidated total capital ratio was 133 percent and its tier 1 capital ratio was 105 percent for a further description of these guidelines see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s 2010 annual report 

 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 percent for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans at december 31 2010 the company’s leverage ratio was 91 percent 

 

the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published a revision to the accord “basel ii” us banking regulators published a final basel ii rule in december 2007 which requires the company to implement basel ii at the holding company level as well as at its key us bank subsidiaries a further revision to the accord was published in december 2010 “basel iii” with implementation to be phased in beginning in 2013 although banking regulators have not yet issued regulations implementing basel iii the domestic implementation of basel iii will increase the company’s capital requirements 

 

the doddfrank act contained amendments to holding company capital requirements these amendments effectively eliminated differences between the minimum capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions and their holding companies by phasing out the use of hybrid debt instruments such as trust preferred securities in determining holding company regulatory capital

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 the “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the glba the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments 

 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures in 2009 the fdic revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate a depository institution is assessed premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held higher levels of banks failures have dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and depleted the deposit insurance fund in addition in 2008 the amount of fdic insurance coverage for insured deposits was generally increased from 100000 per depositor account ownership type to 250000 

 

in light of the increased stress on the deposit insurance fund caused by these developments and in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund the fdic a imposed a special assessment in june 2009 b has increased assessment rates of insured institutions generally and c required insured institutions to prepay on december 30 2009 the premiums that were expected to become due for 2010 2011 and 2012 in addition the doddfrank act alters the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base and seeks to fund part of the cost of the doddfrank act by increasing 

the deposit insurance reserve fund to 135 percent of estimated insured deposits the doddfrank act also requires that fdic assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than 10 billion this provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the company 

 

the doddfrank act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from 100000 per account ownership type to 250000 and extended the unlimited insurance of noninterest bearing transaction accounts under the fdic transaction account guaranty program to january 1 2013 

 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power to a transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors b enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or c repudiate or disaffirm any contracts if the fdic determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as us bank national association 

 

depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nonus offices as a result those noteholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository 

 

orderly liquidation of bank holding companies the doddfrank act provides for the orderly liquidation of certain financial services companies including bank holding companies through the appointment of the fdic as receiver upon insolvency and the occurrence of certain other events although these provisions became effective upon enactment of the doddfrank act only some of the regulations have been proposed and none have been adopted to date 

 

in preparation for the potential exercise of this authority the fdic created the office of complex financial institutions its duties include the continuous review and oversight of bank holding companies with assets of more than 100 billion the doddfrank act also requires each bank holding company with 50 billion or more in assets to prepare a “living will” to facilitate the company’s rapid and orderly liquidation in the event of material financial distress or failure 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with that institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic claim for crossguarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution 

 

transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the company and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from the company’s banking subsidiaries including us bank national association and us bank national association nd under the federal reserve act and regulation w of the federal reserve the company’s banking subsidiaries and their subsidiaries may only engage in lending and other “covered transactions” with nonbank and nonsavings bank affiliates to the following extent a in the case of any single affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary and b in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary 

 

covered transactions between the company’s banking subsidiaries and their affiliates are also subject to certain collateralization requirements all covered transactions including transactions with a third party in which an affiliate of the banking subsidiary has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms “covered transactions” are defined to include a a loan or extension of credit by a bank subsidiary to an affiliate b a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary by an affiliate c a purchase of assets unless otherwise 

exempted by the federal reserve by the banking subsidiary from an affiliate d the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan and e the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate 

 

antimoney laundering and suspicious activity several federal laws including the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “patriot act” require all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things implement policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

 

community reinvestment act the company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra the banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner consistent with the cra 

 

the occ regularly assesses each of the company’s banking subsidiaries on its record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including lowincome and moderateincome neighborhoods the assessment also is considered when the federal reserve reviews applications by banking institutions to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company and those records may be the basis for denying the application
