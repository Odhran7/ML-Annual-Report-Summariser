▪ product tampering and 

▪ the possible unavailability andor expense of liability insurance 

the pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in the companys products these pathogens can also be introduced to products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers the company does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution if one or more of these risks were to materialize the company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted in addition revenues could decrease costs of doing business could increase and the company’s operating results could be adversely affected

the company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary there can be no assurance given however that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the company’s operating results 

fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of raw materials and other inputs could harm the company’s earnings the company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork poultry beef feed grains and nuts as well as supplies energy and other inputs and the selling prices for many of the companys products which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand 

the company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials including hogs purchased for the austin minnesota processing facility longterm supply agreements for pork and spot market purchases of pork this approach ensures a more stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in the shortterm in higher or lower live hog costs compared to the cash spot market marketbased pricing on certain product lines and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered and these higher costs could adversely affect the companys shortterm financial results 

jennieo turkey store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains which fluctuate due to climate conditions production forecasts and supply and demand conditions at local regional national and worldwide markets the company attempts to manage some of its shortterm exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying using futures contracts and pursuing pricing advances however these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions 

the company may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for nuts tomatoes avocados or other produce if poor growing conditions have a negative effect on agricultural productivity reductions in crop size or quality due to unfavorable growing conditions may have an adverse effect on the company’s results 

the supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products to mitigate this risk the company partners with multiple longterm suppliers 

international trade barriers and other restrictions or disruptions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins thereby potentially lowering prices the company occasionally utilizes incountry production to limit this exposure 

market demand for the company’s products may fluctuate the company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources including pork beef turkey chicken fish nuts nut butters whey and plantbased proteins the factors on which the company competes include 

▪ price 

▪ product quality and attributes 

▪ brand identification 

▪ breadth of product line and 

▪ customer service

damage to the company’s reputation or brand image can adversely affect its business maintaining and continually enhancing the perception of the company’s reputation and brands is critical to business success the company’s reputation and brands have been in the past and could in the future be adversely impacted by a number of factors including unfavorable consumer perception related to events or rumors adverse publicity and negative information disseminated through social and digital media failure to maintain extend and expand the company’s reputation or brand image could adversely impact operating results 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters if such climate change has a negative impact on agricultural productivity the company may have decreased availability or less favorable pricing for the raw materials necessary for its operations climate change may also cause decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and supply chain in addition natural disasters and extreme weather including those caused by climate change could cause disruptions in the company’s operations and supply chain 

the increasing concern over climate change may also result in greater local state federal and foreign legal requirements including requirements to limit greenhouse gas emissions or conserve water usage if such requirements are enacted the company could experience significant cost increases in its operations and supply chain further failure to accomplish goals set by the company related to climate change or meet expectations of various company stakeholders may cause decreased demand for the company’s products and have an adverse effect on results of operations

net sales decreased for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 due to reduced commodity sales and the impact from an additional week of sales last year organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased led by growth from the grocery products and international  other segments the grocery products segment benefited from pricing actions effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter 

fiscal 2022 marked the third consecutive year of record sales for the company record net sales were primarily driven by the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business and growth from the companys foodservice businesses all segments implemented pricing actions during the fiscal year to combat inflationary pressures

cost of products sold   

  

cost of products sold for the fourth quarter decreased resulting from lower sales due to the additional week in fiscal 2021 for fiscal 2022 cost of products sold increased due to inflationary pressures stemming from raw materials packaging freight labor and other inputs the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business was also a driver of higher costs for the full year 

in fiscal 2023 costs are expected to remain elevated due to the continued impacts of broadbased inflation raw material input costs for pork beef turkey and feed are anticipated to remain volatile and above historical levels 

  

gross profit   

consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022 increased primarily due to improved profitability from the jennieo turkey store segment the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business and pricing actions to help mitigate inflationary pressures across all segments gross profit as a percentage of net sales also benefited from the reduction of lower margin commodity sales resulting from the companys new pork supply agreement 

compared to the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased for the jennieo turkey store segment and declined for the other segments for fiscal 2022 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased for the jennieo turkey store and international  other segments and decreased for the refrigerated foods and grocery products segments all business segments were negatively impacted by broadbased inflationary pressures

sga expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 declined primarily due to the additional week in fiscal 2021 sga expenses for fiscal 2022 increased due to the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business and higher marketing and advertising investments as a percent of net sales sga expenses declined for the full year driven by record sales and disciplined cost management

jennieo turkey store 

  

as anticipated volume and sales declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as a result of the supply impacts on the companys vertically integrated supply chain from hpai for fiscal 2022 higher foodservice and wholebird sales due to favorable pricing drove the marginal sales increase

international  other 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 volume and net sales growth from the spam ® and skippy ® brands and the multinational businesses were offset by lower fresh pork and refrigerated export sales for fiscal 2022 volume and sales declined as a result of lower commodity sales due to the companys new pork supply agreement and ongoing export logistics challenges 

segment profit declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as growth in china did not overcome the impact of lower margins and higher logistics expenses for the export business segment profit for the full year declined due in large part to lower results from the export business which was negatively impacted by logistics challenges and meaningfully higher freight expenses 

in fiscal 2023 the international  other segment will be reported within the companys new international segment refer to the fiscal 2023 outlook in the executive summary for additional forwardlooking commentary 

unallocated income and expense 

the company does not allocate deferred compensation investment income interest expense or interest income to its segments when measuring performance the company also retains various other income and unallocated expenses at the corporate level equity in earnings of affiliates is included in segment profit however earnings attributable to the company’s noncontrolling interests are excluded these items are included in the segment table for the purpose of reconciling segment results to earnings before income taxes 

  

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 net unallocated expense increased slightly as unfavorable investment performance was mostly offset with lower corporate expense 

for fiscal 2022 net unallocated expense decreased due to onetime acquisition costs and accounting adjustments of 43 million related to the acquisition of the planters ® snack nuts business in fiscal 2021 the overall decline was partially offset by higher interest expense and lower investment income net of deferred compensation 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap adjusted financial measurement of adjusted diluted earnings per share is presented to provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations this measurement excludes the impact of the acquisitionrelated expenses and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the planters ® snack nuts business the tax impact was calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarter in which the expenses and accounting adjustments were incurred

the company provides earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda because these measures are useful to management and investors as indicators of operating strength relative to prior years and are commonly used to benchmark the company’s performance

critical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates 

revenue recognition 

description the company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer obligations for the company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts returns and allowances 

judgments and uncertainties the company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers incentives offered offinvoice include prompt pay allowances will call allowances spoilage allowances and temporary price reductions these incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time control is transferred coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products the coupons reduce revenue at the time they are offered based on estimated redemption rates promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the company’s products to consumers these incentives reduce revenue at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year accruals with customers are based on defined performance 

sensitivity of estimate to change the liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year the level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities 

income taxes 

description the company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur 

judgments and uncertainties the company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision 

sensitivity of estimate to change while the company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable the company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due the company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits the position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change as of october 30 2022 the company had 218 million of unrecognized tax benefits including estimated interest and penalties recorded in other longterm liabilities 

business combinations 

description the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties the acquisition method of accounting requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined through established valuation techniques such as the income cost or market approach the company may utilize thirdparty 

valuation experts to assist in the fair value determination the fair value measurements of identifiable intangibles are based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about the future significant assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets may include projected revenue growth estimated cash flows discount rates royalty rates and other factors 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the company’s intent to continue to support and build the brands other acquired assets such as customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives 

sensitivity of estimate to change the company did not have any business combinations in fiscal 2022 on june 7 2021 the company acquired the planters ® snack nuts business for 34 billion and used a thirdparty valuation specialist to perform the valuation of the assets acquired refer to note b  acquisitions and divestitures for additional information the company acquired tradenames which were determined to have a fair value of 7120 million key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the tradenames using a relief from royalty model included revenue projections royalty rates and discount rates the company also identified customer relationships which were assigned a fair value of 510 million using the distributor method under the income approach assumptions in valuing this asset included future earnings projections customer attrition rate and discount rate among others the company believes the estimates applied are based on reasonable assumptions but which are inherently uncertain as a result actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine fair value of the assets acquired which could result in material impairment losses in the future 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles 

description other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily include tradenames obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the company’s reporting units grocery products refrigerated foods jennieo turkey store and international goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings see note a  summary of significant accounting policies for additional details regarding the company’s procedures 

judgments and uncertainties determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment indefinitelived tradenames are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method significant assumptions include royalty rate annual projected revenue discount rate and estimated long term growth rate estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows revenues earnings discount rates long term growth rates and other factors 

sensitivity of estimate to change the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends macroeconomic conditions and projections consistent with the company’s operating strategy changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 the company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill no goodwill impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing the company last completed quantitative testing in fiscal 2021 and the estimated fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value by more than 50 percent based on the 2021 testing a 10 percent decline in projected cash flows or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in an impairment 

the company also performed qualitative impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing the company last completed quantitative testing in fiscal 2021 and the estimated fair value of each indefinitelived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value by more than 10 percent based on the fiscal 2021 testing a 10 percent decline in forecasted revenue or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in a material impairment 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

description the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans and recognizes the associated expenses assets and liabilities 

judgments and uncertainties in accounting for these employment costs and the associated benefit obligations management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates discount rates compensation increases expected return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and interest crediting rates the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on fair value composition of the asset portfolio historical longterm rates of return and estimates of future performance mortality and discount rates used are based on actuarial tables elected at each fiscal yearend the company uses thirdparty specialists 

to assist in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation

▪ food allergens 

▪ nutritional and healthrelated concerns 

▪ federal state and local food processing controls 

▪ consumer product liability claims 

▪ product tampering and 

▪ the possible unavailability andor expense of liability insurance 

the pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products these pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers we do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution if one or more of these risks were to materialize the company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted in addition revenues could decrease costs of doing business could increase and the company’s operating results could be adversely affected

in recent years the outbreak of asf has impacted hog herds in china asia europe and the caribbean if an outbreak of asf were to occur in the united states the companys supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted 

the company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary there can be no assurance given however that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the company’s operating results 

fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of raw materials and other inputs could harm the company’s earnings the company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork poultry beef feed grains and nuts as well as supplies energy and other inputs and the selling prices for many of our products which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand 

the company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials including hogs purchased for our austin minnesota processing facility longterm supply agreements for pork and spot market purchases of pork this approach ensures a more stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in the shortterm in higher or lower live hog costs compared to the cash spot market marketbased pricing on certain product lines and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered and these higher costs could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

jennieo turkey store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains which fluctuates due to climate conditions production forecasts and supply and demand conditions at local regional national and worldwide markets the company attempts to manage some of its shortterm exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying using futures contracts and pursuing pricing advances however these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions 

the company may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for nuts tomatoes avocados or other produce if poor growing conditions have a negative affect on agricultural productivity reductions in crop size or quality due to unfavorable growing conditions may have an adverse effect on the company’s results 

the supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products to mitigate this risk the company partners with multiple longterm suppliers 

international trade barriers and other restrictions or disruptions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins thereby potentially lowering prices the company occasionally utilizes incountry production to limit this exposure 

market demand for the company’s products may fluctuate the company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources including pork beef turkey chicken fish nuts nut butters whey and plantbased proteins the factors on which the company competes include 

▪ price 

▪ product quality and attributes 

▪ brand identification 

▪ breadth of product line and 

▪ customer service 

demand for the company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of the company’s advertising and marketing programs and consumer perceptions failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to among other things reduced demand for the company’s brands and products the company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations the company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations as well as any modifications is material to the company’s business some of the company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and over time the company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require the company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation assessment or other requirements the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the company’s financial results

volume and net sales   



  

1 see the nongaap financial measures section below for a description of the companys use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

  

net sales for the fourth quarter were an alltime record benefiting from pricing actions across the entire portfolio organic volume growth and the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business  results from the foodservice businesses in refrigerated foods and jennieo turkey store were particularly strong due to the continued recovery in the foodservice industry after a significant decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 

for fiscal 2021 net sales were an alltime record strong growth from the foodservice businesses higher pricing across all segments and the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business were the primary drivers 

in fiscal 2022 the company expects net sales growth from all four business segments driven primarily by the impact of higher pricing across the portfolio volume growth from the valueadded businesses and the benefit of a full year of the planters ® snack nuts business offsetting a portion of this growth will be the impact from the new pork supply agreement which is expected to have a negative cumulative impact on the refrigerated foods and international  other business segments of approximately 350 million 

cost of products sold   



  

for fiscal 2021 cost of products sold for the fourth quarter and full year increased due to inflationary pressures stemming from raw materials packaging freight labor and many other inputs the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business during the third quarter was also a driver of higher costs 

direct incremental supply chain costs related to the covid19 pandemic for fiscal 2021 were approximately 21 million this compares to approximately 80 million of higher operational costs related to the covid19 pandemic incurred during fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2022 the company expects cost of products sold to be higher due to the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business and continued inflation raw material input costs for pork beef turkey and feed are anticipated to remain above historical levels 

  

gross profit   



consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year declined driven primarily by broadbased inflationary pressures and a lag in mitigating pricing actions gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased sequentially compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as pricing actions across the entire portfolio became effective gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined for all four business segments in the fourth quarter and for the full year compared to fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2022 the company expects gross profit as a percentage of net sales to improve due to the impact of pricing actions taken across all business segments during fiscal 2021 incremental cost inflation poses the largest risk to this assumption the company also expects to benefit in the first half of fiscal 2022 from the positive mix impact from the addition of the planters ® snack nuts business 

selling general and administrative sga 



sga expenses for the fourth quarter and full year increased due to the incremental and onetime acquisitionrelated costs related to the planters ® snack nuts business and higher employeerelated expenses as a percentage of sales sga declined for both the fourth quarter and full year due to record net sales and disciplined expense management

grocery products 



net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased significantly due to the inclusion of the planters ® snack nuts business higher pricing and organic volume growth from the center store and mexican foods portfolios growth from brands such as spam ®  hormel ® compleats ®  wholly ®  and skippy ® contributed to the strong results for fiscal 2021 net sales increased due to the contribution from the planters ® snack nuts business and the benefit of pricing actions across the portfolio especially in the fourth fiscal quarter 

for the fourth quarter and full year segment profit increased due to the addition of the planters ® snack nuts business and improved organic sales higher pricing across the portfolio helped mitigate inflationary pressure volume net sales and segment profit were constrained by production labor shortages and supply chain disruptions 

looking ahead to fiscal 2022 grocery products expects to continue to benefit from the addition of the planters ® snack nuts business pricing actions taken on most product lines and strong demand for many of its leading retail and mexican foods brands risks to profitability include additional inflationary pressures and labor shortages impacting production on key product lines 

refrigerated foods   



the continued recovery in the foodservice industry numerous pricing actions and strong demand led to significant net sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to last year the foodservice business delivered volume and net sales gains in every category retail and deli net sales benefited from higher pricing and continued elevated demand for products such as columbus ® grabandgo items hormel ® gatherings ® party trays hormel ® black label ® bacon hormel ® pepperoni and applegate ® natural and organic meats for the full year net sales increased due to strong growth from the retail deli and foodservice businesses within refrigerated foods which benefited from pricing actions impacting the second half of the year

in fiscal 2022 refrigerated foods is expecting continued net sales growth from the retail deli and foodservice businesses due to strong demand and pricing actions taken throughout fiscal 2021 net sales will be negatively impacted by lower commodity sales due to the new pork supply contract profitability is expected to improve due to higher pricing and a more profitable product mix risks to profitability include additional inflationary pressures and labor shortages impacting production on key product lines 

jennieo turkey store 



  

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 volume and sales increased as the continued recovery in foodservice strong demand for jennieo ® retail items and higher prices across the portfolio more than offset the negative impact from shifting whole bird shipments to earlier in the year for the full year sales increased significantly due to favorable commodity prices and higher valueadded volumes and pricing 

segment profit for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 declined due primarily to higher feed costs and increased freight expenses  

looking ahead to fiscal 2022 jennieo turkey store expects momentum from its valueadded and commodity businesses to continue due to the benefit of improved pricing and strong demand segment profit is expected to improve in fiscal 2022 due to higher pricing increased feed operational and logistics costs are expected to weigh on profitability nearterm with improvement expected in the back half of the year 

international  other 



  

net sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year was broadbased driven by strong demand and higher prices for branded exports and improved results in china fresh pork export volume declined for the quarter and for the full year due to labor shortages 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 all areas of the business delivered growth in segment profits led by higher export margins and china segment profit improved significantly for the full year driven by gains from exports higher income from the companys partners in the philippines south korea and europe and strong results in china 

the international  other segment anticipates business momentum to continue led by growth in china strong export demand and the impact of higher prices in fiscal 2022 net sales and profits will be modestly impacted by lower commodity sales due to the new pork supply contract international shipping interruptions pose a risk to export sales and profit growth 

  

unallocated income and expense 

the company does not allocate deferred compensation investment income interest expense or interest income to its segments when measuring performance the company also retains various other income and unallocated expenses at the corporate level equity in earnings of affiliates is included in segment profit however earnings attributable to the company’s noncontrolling interests are excluded these items are included in the segment table for the purpose of reconciling segment results to earnings before income taxes 



  

net unallocated expense decreased for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as favorable reserve adjustments more than offset higher interest expense and lower investment income for the full year net unallocated expense increased significantly due to onetime acquisition costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the planters ® snack nuts business of 43 million and higher interest expense these increases were partially offset by higher investment income 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap adjusted financial measurements of adjusted operating income adjusted selling general and administrative expenses and adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented to provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations these measurements exclude the impact of the acquisitionrelated expenses and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the planters ® snack nuts business the tax impact was calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarter in which the expenses and accounting adjustments were incurred

revenue recognition 

description the company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer obligations for the company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts returns and allowances 

judgments and uncertainties the company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers incentives offered offinvoice include prompt pay allowances will call allowances spoilage allowances and temporary price reductions these incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time control is transferred coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products the coupons reduce revenues at the time they are offered based on estimated redemption rates promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the company’s products to consumers these incentives reduce revenues at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year accruals with customers are based on defined performance 

sensitivity of estimate to change the liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the 

end of the fiscal year the level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities

description the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties the acquisition method of accounting requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined through established valuation techniques such as the income cost or market approach the company may utilize thirdparty valuation experts to assist in the fair value determination the fair value measurements of identifiable intangibles are based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about the future significant assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets may include projected revenue growth estimated cash flows discount rates royalty rates and other factors 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the company’s intent to continue to support and build the brands other acquired assets such as customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives 

sensitivity of estimate to change on june 7 2021 the company acquired the planters ® snack nuts business for 34 billion and used a thirdparty valuation specialist to perform the valuation of the assets acquired refer to note b  acquisitions and divestitures for more information the company acquired tradenames which were determined to have a fair value of 7120 million key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the tradenames using a relief from royalty model included revenue projections royalty rates and discount rates the company also identified customer relationships which were assigned a fair value of 510 million using the distributor method under the income approach assumptions in valuing this asset included future earnings projections customer attrition rate and discount rate among others the company believes the estimates applied to be based on reasonable assumptions but which are inherently uncertain as a result actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine fair value of the assets acquired which could result in material impairment losses in the future 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles 

description other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily include tradenames obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the company’s reporting units grocery products refrigerated foods jennieo turkey store and international goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings see note a  summary of significant accounting policies for additional details regarding the company’s procedures 

judgments and uncertainties determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment indefinitelived tradenames are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method significant assumptions include 

royalty rate annual projected revenue discount rate and estimated long term growth rate estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows revenues earnings discount rates long term growth rates and other factors 

sensitivity of estimate to change the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends macroeconomic conditions and projections consistent with the company’s operating strategy changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the company elected to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill no goodwill impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing and the estimated fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value by more than 50 percent a 10 percent decline in projected cash flows or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in an impairment 

the company also elected to perform quantitative impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of each indefinitelived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value by more than 10 percent as such no impairment charges were recorded a 10 percent decline in forecasted revenue or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in a material impairment 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

description the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans and recognizes the associated expenses assets and liabilities

benefit plan assets are stated at fair value due to the lack of readily available market prices private equity investments are valued by models using a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples discounted cash flows and other qualitative and quantitative factors other benefit plan investments are measured at net asset value nav per share of the funds underlying investments as a practical expedient 

sensitivity of estimate to change the assumed discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increase and health care cost trend rate have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the benefit plans for the year ended october 31 2021 the company had 17120 million and 2747 million in pension benefit obligation and postretirement benefit obligation respectively for fiscal 2022 the company expects a credit of 66 million in pension benefit costs and an expense of 105 million in postretirement benefit costs a onepercentagepoint change in these rates would have the following effects

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

hog markets the company’s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the live hog market to minimize the impact on earnings and ensure a steady supply of quality hogs the company has entered into contracts with producers for the purchase of hogs at formulabased prices over periods of up to 10 years hogs purchased under contract accounted for 96 percent and 95 percent of the total hogs purchased by the company during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the majority of these contracts use marketbased formulas based on hog futures hog primal values or industry reported hog markets other contracts use a formula based on the cost of production which can fluctuate independently from hog markets the company’s valueadded branded portfolio helps mitigate changes in hog and pork market prices therefore a hypothetical 10 percent change in the cash hog market would have had an immaterial effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company utilizes a hedge program to reduce exposure and offset the fluctuations in the company’s future direct hog purchases this program utilizes lean hog futures which are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts in this program as of october 31 2021 was 02 million compared to 31 million as of october 25 2020 the company measures its market risk exposure on its lean hog futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for lean hogs a 10 percent decrease in the market price for lean hogs would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 31 2021 open lean hog contracts by 79 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased hogs by a similar amount 

  

turkey production costs the company raises or contracts for live turkeys to meet the majority of its raw material supply requirements production costs in raising turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs under normal longterm market conditions changes in the cost to produce turkeys are offset by proportional changes in the turkey market

other input costs the costs of raw materials packaging materials freight fuel and energy may cause the companys results to fluctuate significantly to manage input cost volatility the company pursues cost saving measures forward pricing derivatives and pricing actions when necessary 

investments the company has corporateowned life insurance policies classified as trading securities as part of a rabbi trust to fund certain supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans as of october 31 2021 the balance of these securities totaled 2030 million compared to 1731 million as of october 25 2020 the rabbi trust is invested primarily in fixed income funds the company is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the value of the remaining investments as unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are included in the company’s net earnings on a marktomarket basis a 10 percent decline in the value of the investments not held in fixed income funds would have a negative impact to the company’s pretax earnings of approximately 100 million while a 10 percent increase in value would have a positive impact of the same amount 

  

international assets the fair values of certain company assets are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies the company’s net asset position in foreign currencies as of october 31 2021 was 6572 million compared to 5412 million as of october 25 2020 with most of the exposure existing in chinese yuan and brazilian real changes in currency exchange rates impact the fair values of the company assets either currently through the consolidated statements of operations within interest and investment income or through the consolidated statements of financial position within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

the company measures its foreign currency exchange risk by using a 10 percent sensitivity analysis on the company’s primary foreign net asset position the chinese yuan and the brazilian real as of october 31 2021 a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 433 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 354 million pretax a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 117 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 96 million pretax

industry risks 

the company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry the food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by 

▪ food spoilage 

▪ food contamination caused by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella  and pathogenic e coli  

▪ food allergens 

▪ nutritional and healthrelated concerns 

▪ federal state and local food processing controls 

▪ consumer product liability claims 

▪ product tampering and 

▪ the possible unavailability andor expense of liability insurance 

the pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products these pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers we do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution if one or more of these risks were to materialize the company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted in addition revenues could decrease costs of doing business could increase and the company’s operating results could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the company’s revenues and operating margins 

the company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock and poultry flocks including african swine fever asf bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse pneumovirus porcine circovirus 2 pcv2 porcine reproduction  respiratory syndrome prrs footandmouth disease fmd porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai the outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the company’s supply of raw materials increase the cost of production reduce utilization of the company’s harvest facilities and reduce operating margins additionally the outbreak of disease may hinder the company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally 

in recent years the outbreak of asf has impacted hog herds in china asia and europe if an outbreak of asf were to occur in the united states the companys supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted 

the company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary there can be no assurance given however that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the company’s operating results 

fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork poultry beef feed grains avocados peanuts and energy could harm the company’s earnings the company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork poultry beef feed grains avocados and peanuts as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand 

the live hog industry has evolved to large verticallyintegrated operations using longterm supply agreements typically this results in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market consequently the company uses longterm supply contracts priced on marketbased formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in the shortterm in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices marketbased pricing on certain product lines and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered and these higher costs could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

jennieo turkey store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains which fluctuates due to climate conditions production forecasts and supply and demand conditions at local regional national and worldwide 

markets the company attempts to manage some of its shortterm exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying using futures contracts and pursuing pricing advances however these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions 

the supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products to mitigate this risk the company partners with multiple longterm suppliers 

international trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins thereby potentially lowering prices the company occasionally utilizes incountry production to limit this exposure 

market demand for the company’s products may fluctuate the company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources including pork beef turkey chicken fish nut butters whey and plantbased proteins the factors on which the company competes include 

▪ price 

▪ product quality and attributes 

▪ brand identification 

▪ breadth of product line and 

▪ customer service 

demand for the company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of the company’s advertising and marketing programs and consumer perceptions failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to among other things reduced demand for the company’s brands and products the company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future

grocery products segment profit for the full year increased as improved center store retail sales and favorable product mix more than overcame the divestiture of cytosport and the benefit from a legal settlement in fiscal 2019 international  other segment results increased significantly for the full year of fiscal 2020 due to higher income from the companys partners in the philippines south korea and europe branded export growth and improved results in china earnings for the jennieo turkey store segment deceased primarily due to lower foodservice earnings and increased supply chain costs related to the covid19 impacts on manufacturing and live production refrigerated foods segment results declined for the full year as lower foodservice sales and incremental supply chain costs related to covid19 more than offset excellent performances from the retail businesses 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the company committed to making investments necessary to keep its team members safe these investments included enhanced safety procedures across the companys facilities providing personal protective equipment for all production team members frequent disinfecting of hightouch areas reconfiguration of common areas and workstations temperature and wellness screenings revised shift scheduling reduced production line speeds new guidelines on carpooling more extensive social distancing measures throughout each facility and where possible providing remote work opportunities and facilitating access to rapid testing for employees the company also paid over 11 million in bonuses to full and parttime plant production team members during the year

in march the company acquired sadlers smokehouse for 2708 million in june the company issued 10 billion tenyear notes at an annual interest rate of 18 percent the proceeds from the offering is expected to provide liquidity and allow the business to take advantage of strategic opportunities 

fiscal 2021 outlook we are optimistic about our ability to grow sales and earnings in fiscal 2021 sales for our retail products is expected to remain strong but not to the level of growth seen in fiscal 2020 sales momentum for products such as skippy ® peanut butter herdez ® salsas and sauces hormel ® black label ® bacon applegate ® brands and jennieo ® lean ground turkey is expected to continue key product lines are expected to benefit from structurally higher capacity compared to last year we anticipate a modest recovery in the foodservice industry but likely not back to 2019 levels brands like hormel ® bacon 1 tm  hormel ® fire braised tm  sadler’s ®  and café h ® are wellpositioned to grow as the industry recovers additional restrictions related to onpremise dining and regional lockdowns could impact the recovery of the foodservice industry we expect the covid19 related higher cost structure in our domestic operations to continue through the first half of fiscal 2021 and for the majority of covid19 costs to subside as the pandemic comes under control the availability of labor to staff our domestic production facilities and higher input costs present risk to our sales and profitability barring any unforeseen trade issues the international  other segment expects continued growth from the china business and the spam ® and skippy ® brands

grocery products 



demand for center store brands remained strong in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 led by growth from brands such as s kippy ®  herdez ®  and hormel ® compleats ®  sales for the quarter were impacted by lower inventory levels and production limitations related to the covid19 pandemic on certain center store products and lower sales for megamex foodservice items for the full year net sales increased as growth from many center store brands more than offset the impact from the cytosport divestiture last year 

segment profit for the fourth quarter increased as improved results across the nut butters portfolio more than offset increased freight expense and lower earnings from our megamex foodservice business segment profit for the full year increased as improved sales and favorable product mix more than overcame the divestiture of cytosport and the benefit from a legal settlement in fiscal 2019 

looking ahead to fiscal 2021 grocery products expects strong demand for its branded retail items to continue the business will benefit from structural capacity improvements on key categories such as canned meats and chili higher input costs could negatively pressure profitability 

refrigerated foods   



for the fourth quarter retail and deli sales growth from brands such as applegate ®  hormel ® black label ®  and columbus ®  in addition to the impact from the sadler’s smokehouse acquisition did not offset a significant decline in foodservice sales sales were impacted by production limitations due to the covid19 pandemic and lower inventory levels full year sales increased due to strong demand for branded retail products higher commodity sales and the benefit from the sadlers smokehouse acquisition 

for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020 the decline in segment profit was due to lower foodservice sales and incremental supply chain costs related to covid19 fourth quarter segment profit was also negatively impacted by a decrease in commodity profits

jennieo turkey store 



  

fourth quarter volume and sales growth of jennieo ® lean ground products and whole birds were exceptionally strong reduced demand for foodservice and commodity products led to the overall decline in sales sales increased for fiscal 2020 as improvements in retail whole bird and commodity sales more than offset a dramatic decline in foodservice sales 

lower foodservice earnings and increased supply chain costs related to the covid19 pandemic drove the decline in segment profit for the fourth quarter and full year 

jennieo turkey store expects growth from jennieo branded retail products a recovery in the foodservice business and an improvement in the vertically integrated supply chain incremental covid19 related costs are expected to persist through the first half of fiscal 2021 as the pandemic comes under control the majority of these costs should subside limited labor availability and higher feed costs for 2021 pose a risk to sales and profitability

critical accounting policies 

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates judgments and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements see note a  summary of significant accounting policies additional information 

  

critical accounting policies are defined as those reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions as conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic evolve the company expects these judgments and estimates may be subject to change which could materially impact future periods  the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition the company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer obligations for the company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts returns and allowances 

  

the company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers incentives offered offinvoice include prompt pay allowances will call allowances spoilage allowances and temporary price reductions these incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time control is transferred coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products the coupons reduce revenues at the time they are offered based on estimated redemption rates promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the company’s products to consumers these incentives reduce revenues at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year promotional contractual accruals are based on agreements with customers for defined performance the liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year the level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities 

  

inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value for pork inventories when the carcasses are disassembled and transferred from primal processing to various manufacturing departments the primal values as adjusted by the company for product specifications and further processing become the basis for calculating inventory values turkey raw materials are represented by the deboned meat quantities the company values these raw materials using a concept referred to as the “meat cost pool” the meat cost pool is determined by combining the cost to grow turkeys with processing costs less any net sales revenue from byproducts created from the processing and not used in producing company products the company has developed a series of ratios using historical data and current market conditions which themselves involve estimates and judgment determinations by the company to allocate the meat cost pool to each meat component substantially all inventoriable expenses meat packaging and supplies are valued by the average cost method 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles estimating the fair value of the company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgment upon initial valuation determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the company’s intent to continue to support and build the brands other acquired assets such as customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and the residual of the purchase price is recorded to goodwill goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are allocated to the reporting units that will receive the related sales and income goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 

  

goodwill 

in conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if a qualitative assessment determines an impairment is more likely than not the company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required alternatively the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales gross margin and segment profit for each reporting unit as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses factors that may impact its business including macroeconomic conditions and the related impact marketrelated exposures plans to market for sale all or a portion of the business competitive changes new or discontinued product lines changes in key personnel and any potential risks to their projected financial results 

  

if performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level first the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value including goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations level 3 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates terminal values and discount rates the estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit which are approved by the company’s board of directors if the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit then the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment as a result of the qualitative testing during 2020 2019 and 2018 no goodwill impairment charges were recorded 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinitelived intangible assets the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company concludes this is the case a quantitative test for impairment must be performed otherwise the company does not need to perform a quantitative test 

  

in conducting the qualitative assessment the company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses critical areas that may impact the value of its intangible assets or the applicable royalty rates to determine if impairment may be indicated 

  

if performed the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value to the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value using the relief from royalty method level 3 this method incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections discount rates and royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the indefinitelived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded even if not required the company may elect to perform the quantitative test in order to gain further assurance in the qualitative assessment 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company completed its annual indefinitelive impairment tests by performing a qualitative assessment during 2019 the company elected to quantitatively test two indefinitelived intangible assets and to perform a qualitative assessment for the remaining assets no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the qualitative and quantitative testing during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 during fiscal 2018 a 173 million intangible asset impairment charge was recorded for the cytosport trademark no other material impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2018 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits in accounting for these employment costs and the associated liabilities management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates discount rates compensation increases expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation 

  

benefit plan assets are stated at fair value due to the lack of readily available market prices private equity investments are valued by models using a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples discounted cash flows and other qualitative and quantitative factors other benefit plan investments are measured at net asset value nav per share of the funds underlying investments as a practical expedient these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness the company also holds quarterly meetings with the investment adviser to review fund performance which include comparisons to the relevant indices on an annual basis the company performs pricing tests on certain underlying investments to gain additional assurance of the reliability of values received from the fund manager see note f  pension and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

income taxes the company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur 

  

the company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision while the company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable the company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due the company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position this position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 

  

contingent liabilities at any time the company may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against the company such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability contract disputes wage and hour laws employment practices antitrust regulations or other actions brought by employees consumers competitors or suppliers the company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees the company establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against the company when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where the company is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses the company records the amount within that range which constitutes the company’s best estimate the company also discloses the nature and range of loss for claims against the company when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or factors beyond our control 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

hog markets the company’s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the live hog market to minimize the impact on earnings and ensure a steady supply of quality hogs the company has entered into contracts with producers for the purchase of hogs at formulabased prices over periods of up to 10 years hogs purchased under contract accounted for 95 percent and 93 percent of the total hogs purchased by the company during fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively the majority of these contracts use marketbased formulas based on hog futures hog primal values or industry reported hog markets other contracts use a formula based on the cost of production which can fluctuate independently from hog markets the company’s valueadded branded portfolio helps mitigate changes in hog and pork market prices therefore a hypothetical 10 percent change in the cash hog market would have had an immaterial effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company utilizes a hedge program to reduce exposure and offset the fluctuations in the company’s future direct hog purchases this program utilizes lean hog futures which are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts in this program as of october 25 2020 was 31 million compared to 58 million as of october 27 2019 the company measures its market risk exposure on its lean hog futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for lean hogs a 10 percent decrease in the market price for lean hogs would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 25 2020 open lean hog contracts by 93 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased hogs by a similar amount 

  

turkey production costs the company raises or contracts for live turkeys to meet the majority of its raw material supply requirements production costs in raising turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs under normal longterm market conditions changes in the cost to produce turkeys are offset by proportional changes in the turkey market 

  

the company utilizes a hedge program to reduce exposure and offset the fluctuation in the company’s future direct grain purchases this program utilizes corn futures for jennieo turkey store and these contracts are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts as of october 25 2020 was 01 million compared to 22 million as of october 27 2019 the company measures its market risk exposure on its grain futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for grain a 10 percent decrease in the market price for grain would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 25 2020 open grain contracts by 72 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased grain by a similar amount 

  

other input costs the costs of raw materials packaging materials freight fuel and energy may cause the companys results to fluctuate significantly to manage input cost volatility the company pursues cost saving measures forward pricing derivatives and pricing actions when necessary 

investments the company has corporateowned life insurance policies classified as trading securities as part of a rabbi trust to fund certain supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans as of october 25 2020 the balance of these securities totaled 1731 million compared to 1575 million as of october 27 2019 a majority of these securities represent fixed income funds the company is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the value of the remaining investments as unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are included in the company’s net earnings on a marktomarket basis a 10 percent decline in the value of the investments not held in fixed income funds would have a negative impact to the company’s pretax earnings of approximately 84 million while a 10 percent increase in value would have a positive impact of the same amount 

  

international assets the fair values of certain company assets are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies the company’s net asset position in foreign currencies as of october 25 2020 was 5412 million compared to 5438 million as of october 27 2019 with most of the exposure existing in chinese yuan and brazilian real changes in currency exchange rates impact the fair values of the company assets either currently through the consolidated statements of operations within interest and investment income or through the consolidated statements of financial position within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

the company measures its foreign currency exchange risk by using a 10 percent sensitivity analysis on the company’s primary foreign net asset position the chinese yuan and the brazilian real as of october 25 2020 a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 407 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 333 million pretax a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 104 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 85 million pretax

deterioration of economic conditions could harm the company’s business the companys business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the company 

volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the company’s operations as follows 

 

the company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various commodity market risks which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the company’s earnings each period these instruments may limit the company’s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices become more favorable than those secured under the company’s hedging programs 

additionally if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the united states it may negatively impact the national economy demand for company products andor the company’s workforce availability and the company’s financial results could suffer the company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations and will continue to update these plans as necessary there can be no assurance given however these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the company’s operating results 

outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the company’s revenues and operating margins 

the company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock and poultry flocks including african swine fever asf bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse pneumovirus porcine circovirus 2 pcv2 porcine reproduction  respiratory syndrome prrs footandmouth disease fmd porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai the outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the company’s supply of raw materials increase the cost of production reduce utilization of the company’s harvest facilities and reduce operating margins additionally the outbreak of disease may hinder the company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally 

most recently the outbreak of asf in china has eliminated over 30 percent of that countrys hog herd compared to last year according to the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the peoples republic of china the disease has also spread to additional countries in asia and europe if an outbreak of asf were to occur in the united states the companys supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted 

the company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary there can be no assurance given however that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the company’s operating results 

fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork poultry beef feed grains avocados peanuts energy and whey could harm the company’s earnings the company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork poultry beef feed grains avocados peanuts and whey as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand 

the live hog industry has evolved to large verticallyintegrated operations using longterm supply agreements this has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market consequently the company uses longterm supply contracts based on marketbased formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in the shortterm in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices marketbased pricing on certain product lines and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered and these higher costs could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

jennieo turkey store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains which fluctuate due to climate conditions production forecasts and supply and demand conditions at local regional national and worldwide markets the company attempts to manage some of its shortterm exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying using futures contracts and pursuing pricing advances however these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions 

the supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products to mitigate this risk the company partners with multiple longterm suppliers 

international trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins thereby potentially lowering prices the company occasionally utilizes incountry production to limit this exposure 

market demand for the company’s products may fluctuate the company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources including pork beef turkey chicken fish nut butters whey and plantbased proteins the factors on which the company competes include 

 

demand for the company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of the company’s advertising and marketing programs and consumer perceptions failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to among other things reduced demand for the company’s brands and products the company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future

the company is subject to disruption of operations at copackers or other suppliers disruption of operations at co‑packers or other suppliers may impact the company’s product or raw material supply which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results additionally actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the company’s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation the company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees consumers competitors suppliers shareholders or injured persons and claims relating to product liability contract disputes intellectual property advertising labeling wage and hour laws employment practices or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the company’s financial results 

the company is subject to the loss of a material contract the company is a party to several supply distribution contract packaging and other material contracts the loss of a material contract could adversely affect the company’s financial results 

government regulation present and future exposes the company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the company’s business the company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the us department of homeland security the us department of agriculture the us food and drug administration federal and state taxing authorities and other federal state and local authorities who oversee workforce immigration laws tax regulations animal welfare food safety standards and the processing packaging storage distribution advertising and labeling of the company’s products the company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by federal state and local authorities claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the company in the future the availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the company’s manufacturing facilities additionally the company is subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards the company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the company to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions

the company may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to protect information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks or security breaches information technology systems are an important part of the company’s business operations attempted cyberattack and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise

net sales 

  

the decrease in net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was related primarily to the divestiture of cytosport organic net sales increased 2 percent as increased sales of wholebird and commodity business at jennieo turkey store h ormel ® black label ® bacon the spam ® family of products and hormel ® bacon 1 tm cooked bacon more than offset lower retail sales at jennieo turkey store and lower sales of skippy ®   peanut butter 

for fiscal 2019 the decrease in net sales was related primarily to the divestiture of cytosport organic net sales grew 1 percent over last year driven by strong valueadded sales in refrigerated foods led by hormel ® bacon 1 tm cooked bacon hormel ® fire braised tm products and hormel ® natural choice ® items despite weak retail sales of jennieo turkey store products and declines in international pork exports 

in fiscal 2020 the company expects net sales growth with contributions from valueadded products and innovation momentum in refrigerated foods across the foodservice and retail channels is expected to continue with meaningful growth coming from brands such as hormel ® natural choice ®  applegate ®  hormel ® bacon 1 tm  and hormel ® fire braised tm  the deli division is expected to continue to grow the columbus ® brand the international  other segment plans to show growth in china brazil and through increased branded export sales of spam ® luncheon meat and skippy ® peanut butter jennieo turkey store is expecting sales growth due to increases in turkey commodity markets and regained distribution of jennieo ® branded products growth from products such as wholly ® guacamole dips herdez ® salsas and sauces the spam ® family of products and skippy ® pb and jelly minis in the grocery products segment should offset the impact of the cytosport divestiture

cost of products sold for the fourth quarter and full year increased as higher raw material and operational costs more than offset the impact from the divestiture of cytosport and supply chain cost savings 

  

gross profit 



consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined in the fourth quarter due to reduced commodity profitability in refrigerated foods and weaker margins for the international  other segment for the full year reduced commodity profitability in refrigerated foods weaker sales mix at jennieo turkey store and lower skippy ® peanut butter pricing in grocery products drove the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 

in fiscal 2020 protein input costs are expected to be higher and demonstrate volatility this could negatively impact the refrigerated foods grocery products and international  other segments until pricing can be passed through positive mix shift and higher pricing if necessary are expected to mitigate higher input costs jennieo turkey store should benefit from improvements to operations higher commodity markets and improved sales mix the global trade environment potential impact of african swine fever and market volatility pose the largest threats to the companys profitability 

selling general and administrative sga 



  

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 sga expenses decreased primarily due to the cytosport divestiture for fiscal 2019 sga expenses declined due to the impacts from the cytosport divestiture and a legal settlement selling expenses were also favorable compared to fiscal 2018 

due to the cytosport divestiture advertising investments in the fourth quarter and full year declined

grocery products 



  

net sales increases in the fourth quarter of megamex items including don miguel ® branded items and herdez ® salsas and sauces and from the spam ® family of products were unable to offset the impact of the cytosport divestiture and lower skippy ® peanut butter sales for fiscal 2019 net sales declined due to the cytosport divestiture 

segment profit for the fourth quarter improved due to positive performances from the center store portfolio and megamex joint venture which offset lower pricing on skippy ® peanut butter spreads and the divestiture of cytosport the segment incurred a 173 million noncash impairment in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the cytosport business for fiscal year 2019 segment profit decreased as a result of lower skippy ® peanut butter pricing and declines in megamex earnings 

looking ahead to fiscal 2020 the company anticipates continued positive momentum from megamex including herdez ® salsas and sauces and wholly ® guacamole dips the center store portfolio including the spam ® family of products and improvement from skippy ® peanut butter these positive catalysts should help to partially offset the impact of the cytosport divestiture 

refrigerated foods   



volume and sales increased for the fourth quarter on strong demand for foodservice items such as hormel ® bacon 1 tm cooked bacon pizza toppings and hormel ® fire braised tm products retail sales of hormel ® black label ® bacon applegate ® products hormel ® natural choice ® products hormel gatherings ® party trays and columbus ® branded deli items also contributed to the increase for fiscal 2019 the valueadded businesses drove growth including foodservice brands such as hormel ® firebraised tm and hormel ® natural choice ®  hormel ® black label ® retail convenience bacon and columbus ® branded deli items 

segment profit declined for the fourth quarter as record valueadded profits did not offset a 46 percent decline in commodity profits and higher operational expenses for the full year segment profit increased as valueadded profit growth more than offset a significant decline in commodity profits 

  

in fiscal 2020 the company anticipates valueadded sales and profit growth in the foodservice retail and deli channels pork markets are expected to be volatile and pork input costs are expected to be higher due to the impact of african swine fever this could lead to shortterm periods of margin expansion or compression 

jennieo turkey store 



  

for the fourth quarter volume and sales increased as growth from the wholebird and commodity businesses more than offset lower retail sales jennieo ® lean ground turkey results improved during the fourth quarter due to the successful execution of advertising and promotional activities in select markets net sales for fiscal 2019 declined as improved commodity and wholebird sales did not offset a decline in retail sales 

segment profit for the fourth quarter increased driven by operational improvements and lower freight expense for fiscal 2019 lower retail sales higherthanexpected plant startup expenses and higher feed costs negatively impacted profitability 

jennieo turkey store expects operational improvements continued industry recovery and regained lean ground turkey distribution to return the segment to growth in 2020 

  

international  other 



  

volume sales and profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 declined significantly driven by weakness in branded and fresh pork exports and the companys multinational business in brazil higher pork prices due to african swine fever led to higher input costs in china and brazil 

for fiscal 2019 volume sales and segment profit declined due to weak fresh pork exports which were impact by tariffs and global trade uncertainty this more than offset strong results from the china business 

looking ahead to 2020 the international  other segment anticipates volume sales and earnings growth driven by branded exports cost inflation in china and brazil as well as global trade uncertainty remain a risk

critical accounting policies 

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates judgments and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements see note a for a discussion of significant accounting policies 

  

critical accounting policies are defined as those reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition the company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer obligations for the company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts returns and allowances 

  

the company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers incentives offered offinvoice include prompt pay allowances will call allowances spoilage allowances and temporary price reductions these incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time title passes coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products the coupons reduce revenues at the time they are offered based on estimated redemption rates promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the company’s products to consumers these incentives reduce revenues at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year promotional contractual accruals are based on agreements with customers for defined performance the liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year the level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities 

  

inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value for pork inventories when the carcasses are disassembled and transferred from primal processing to various manufacturing departments the primal values as adjusted by the company for product specifications and further processing become the basis for calculating inventory values turkey raw materials are represented by the deboned meat quantities the company values these raw materials using a concept referred to as the “meat cost pool” the meat cost pool is determined by combining the cost to grow turkeys with processing costs less any net sales revenue from byproducts created from the processing and not used in producing company products the company has developed a series of ratios using historical data and current market conditions which themselves involve estimates and judgment determinations by the company to allocate the meat cost pool to each meat component substantially all inventoriable expenses meat packaging and supplies are valued by the average cost method 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles estimating the fair value of the company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgment upon initial valuation determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the company’s plans to continue to support and build the brands other acquired assets such as customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and the residual of the purchase price is recorded to goodwill goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are allocated to reporting units that will receive the related sales and income goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 

  

in conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if a qualitative assessment determines an impairment is more likely than not the company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required alternatively the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales gross margin and segment profit for each reporting unit as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses critical areas that may impact its business including macroeconomic conditions and the related impact marketrelated exposures any plans to market for sale all or a portion of their business competitive changes new or discontinued product lines changes in key personnel or any potential risks to their projected financial results 

  

if performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level first the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value including goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations level 3 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates terminal values and discount rates the estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit which are approved by the company’s board of directors if the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit then the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment as a result of the qualitative testing no goodwill impairment charges were recorded no goodwill impairment charges were recorded during fiscal years 2018 and 2017  

  

in conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinitelived intangible assets the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company concludes this is the case then a quantitative test for impairment must be performed otherwise the company does not need to perform a quantitative test 

  

in conducting the initial qualitative assessment the company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses critical areas that may impact its intangible assets or the applicable royalty rates to determine if there are factors that could indicate impairment of the asset 

  

if performed the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value to the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value using the relief from royalty method level 3 this method incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections discount rates and royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the indefinitelived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded even if not required the company periodically elects to perform the quantitative test in order to confirm the qualitative assessment 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 the company completed its annual indefinitelive impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the qualitative review it was revealed that further assessment in the form of a quantitative test was necessary for certain indefinitelived intangible assets with a combined carrying value less than 100 million no impairment charges were recorded for 2019 however these assets were determined to have fair values exceeding their carrying value by less than a 10 percent margin management has implemented strategies to address the nominal excess value however adverse events in the future could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger a future impairment charge for a portion of these indefinitelived intangible assets a 10 percent decline in sales or a 10 percent increase in the discount rate would result in an immaterial impairment 

during fiscal 2018 a 173 million intangible asset impairment charge was recorded for the cytosport trademark see additional discussion regarding the company’s goodwill and intangible assets in note e  goodwill and intangible assets during fiscal years 2018 and 2017  there were no other material impairment charges recorded 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits in accounting for these employment costs and the associated liabilities management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates discount rates compensation increases expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation 

  

benefit plan assets are stated at fair value due to the lack of readily available market prices private equity investments are valued by models using a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples discounted cash flows and other qualitative and quantitative factors other benefit plan investments are measured at net asset value nav per share of the funds underlying investments as a practical expedient these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness the company also holds quarterly meetings with the investment adviser to review fund performance which include comparisons to the relevant indices on an annual basis the company performs pricing tests on certain underlying investments to gain additional assurance of the reliability of values 

received from the fund manager see note g  pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes the company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur 

  

the company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision while the company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable the company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due the company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position this position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 

  

contingent liabilities at any time the company may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against the company such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability contract disputes wage and hour laws employment practices or other actions brought by employees consumers competitors or suppliers the company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees the company establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against the company when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where the company is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses the company records the amount within that range which constitutes the company’s best estimate the company also discloses the nature and range of loss for claims against the company when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or factors beyond our control

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

hog markets the company’s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the live hog market to minimize the impact on earnings and ensure a steady supply of quality hogs the company has entered into contracts with producers for the purchase of hogs at formulabased prices over periods of up to 10 years hogs purchased under contract accounted for 93 percent and 96 percent of the total hogs purchased by the company during fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the majority of these contracts use marketbased formulas based on hog futures hog primal values or industry reported hog markets other contracts use a formula based on the cost of production which can fluctuate independently from hog markets the company’s valueadded branded portfolio helps mitigate changes in hog and pork market prices therefore a hypothetical 10 percent change in the cash hog market would have had an immaterial effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company utilizes a hedge program to reduce exposure and offset the fluctuations in the company’s future direct hog purchases this program utilizes lean hog futures which are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts in this program as of october 27 2019  was 58 million before tax compared to 07 million before tax as of october 28 2018 the company measures its market risk exposure on its lean hog futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for lean hogs a 10 percent decrease in the market price for lean hogs would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 27 2019  open lean hog contracts by 195 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased hogs by a similar amount 

  

turkey production costs the company raises or contracts for live turkeys to meet the majority of its raw material supply requirements production costs in raising turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs under normal longterm market conditions changes in the cost to produce turkeys are offset by proportional changes in the turkey market

other input costs the costs of raw materials packaging materials freight fuel and energy may cause the companys results to fluctuate significantly to manage input cost volatility the company pursues cost saving measures forward pricing derivatives and pricing actions when necessary

international assets the fair values of certain company assets are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies the company’s net asset position in foreign currencies as of october 27 2019  was 5438 million compared to 6877 million as of october 28 2018  with most of the exposure existing in chinese yuan and brazilian real changes in currency exchange rates impact the fair values of the company assets either currently through the consolidated statements of operations within interest and investment income or through the consolidated statements of financial position within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

the company measures its foreign currency exchange risk by using a 10 percent sensitivity analysis on the company’s primary foreign net asset position the chinese yuan and the brazilian real as of october 27 2019  a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 337 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 276 million pretax a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 130 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 107 million pretax

the live hog industry has evolved to large verticallyintegrated operations using longterm supply agreements this has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market consequently the company uses longterm supply contracts based on marketbased formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in the shortterm in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices marketbased pricing on certain product lines and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered and these higher costs could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

jots raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains which fluctuate due to climate conditions production forecasts and supply and demand conditions at local regional national and worldwide levels the company attempts to manage some of its shortterm exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying using futures contracts and pursuing pricing advances however these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions 

the supply of natural and organic proteins may impact the company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products to mitigate this risk the company partners with multiple longterm suppliers

demand for the company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of the company’s advertising and marketing programs and consumer perceptions failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to among other things reduced demand for the company’s brands and products the company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these bases in the future

refrigerated foods segment results exceeded last year with contributions from the columbus and fontanini acquisitions strength in valueadded products such as hormel ®  natural choice ®  and hormel ® firebraised tm  meats  overcame lower commodity profits and higher freight expense international  other segment results surpassed last year due to strong growth from the china business which benefited from lower input costs and the addition of the ceratti acquisition the jots segment continued to be negatively impacted by industry oversupply leading to low commodity prices in addition to increased freight at the beginning of fiscal 2018 the specialty foods segment was merged into the grocery products segment despite sales growth of wholly guacamole ® dips and herdez ® salsas grocery products segment financial performance was down from fiscal 2017 as profits were impacted by weakness in the companys contract manufacturing business an impairment of the cytosport trademark and increased freight 

  

our company continued to generate record operating cash flows which were reinvested into the business through acquisitions and capital expenditures while returning cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases we completed the acquisition of columbus an authentic premium deli meat and salami company for 8574 million this strategic acquisition positions us as a total deli solutions provider and enhances our other strong deli brands such as hormel ®  jennieo ®  applegate ®  and dilusso ®  in connection with the acquisition the company borrowed 3750 million under a term loan facility and 3750 million under a revolving credit facility as of the close of the year we repaid the shortterm debt the annual dividend for 2019 will be 084 per share and marks the 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases representing an increase of 12 percent after a 10 percent increase in fiscal 2018 we repurchased 14 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2018 spending 469 million

critical accounting policies 

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company evaluates on an ongoing basis its estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in its business environment the company bases its estimates on experience the use of independent thirdparty specialists and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

critical accounting policies are defined as those reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition  the company recognizes sales when title passes upon delivery of its products to customers net of applicable provisions for discounts returns and allowances products are delivered upon receipt of customer purchase orders with acceptable terms including price and reasonably assured collectability 

  

the company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers incentives offered offinvoice include prompt pay allowances will call allowances spoilage allowances and temporary price reductions these incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time title passes coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products the coupons reduce revenues at the time they are offered based on estimated redemption rates promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the company’s products to consumers these incentives reduce revenues at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year promotional contractual accruals are based on agreements with customers for defined performance the liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year the level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are significant estimates used to determine these liabilities 

  

inventory valuation  the company values inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value for pork inventories when the carcasses are disassembled and transferred from primal processing to various manufacturing departments the primal values as adjusted by the company for product specifications and further processing become the basis for calculating inventory values turkey raw materials are represented by the deboned meat quantities the company values these raw materials using a concept referred to as the “meat cost pool” the meat cost pool is determined by combining the cost to grow turkeys with processing costs less any net sales revenue from byproducts created from the processing and not used in producing company products the company has developed a series of ratios using historical data and current market conditions which themselves involve estimates and judgment determinations by the company to allocate the meat cost pool to each meat component substantially all inventoriable expenses meat packaging and supplies are valued by the average cost method 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles  estimating the fair value of the company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgement accordingly the company obtains the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists who utilize available historical information along with future expectations to value the assets determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgement certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the company’s plans to continue to support and build the brands other acquired assets such as customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and the residual of the purchase price is recorded to goodwill goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are allocated to reporting units that will receive the related sales and income goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 

  

in conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines an impairment is more likely than not the company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required alternatively the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

  

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value the company completed the second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss if any to be recognized in the second step the company estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  as a result the company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 

  

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales gross margin and segment profit for each reporting unit as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses critical areas that may impact its business including macroeconomic conditions and the related impact marketrelated exposures any plans to market for sale all or a portion of their business competitive changes new or discontinued product lines changes in key personnel or any potential risks to their projected financial results 

  

if performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level first the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value including goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations level 3 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates 

terminal values and discount rates the estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit which are approved by the company’s board of directors if the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit then the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment as a result of the qualitative testing during fiscal 2018 and 2016 and quantitative testing during fiscal 2017 no material goodwill impairment charges were recorded an immaterial impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the companys diamond crystal brands dcb business based on the agreedupon sales price for the business 

  

in conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinitelived intangible assets the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not  50 likelihood that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company concludes this is the case then a quantitative test for impairment must be performed otherwise the company does not need to perform a quantitative test 

  

in conducting the initial qualitative assessment the company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests performed additionally the company assesses critical areas that may impact its intangible assets or the applicable royalty rates to determine if there are factors that could indicate impairment of the asset 

  

if performed the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value to the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value using the relief from royalty method level 3 this method incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections and discount rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the indefinitelived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded even if not required the company periodically elects to perform the quantitative test in order to confirm the qualitative assessment 

  

during the 2017 annual impairment review the company completed a quantitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets as a result of the review no material impairment charges were recorded however four trademarks were determined to have fair values exceeding their carrying values by less than a 10 percent margin due to the lack of excess value of these assets the company elected to test these assets using a quantitative analysis during fiscal 2018 for all other indefinitelived intangible assets the company tested the assets using a qualitative analysis during the qualitative review it was determined that further assessment in the form of a quantitative test was necessary for two additional indefinitelived intangible assets in total the company performed a quantitative test for six trademarks in fiscal 2018 one of which was determined to be impaired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 a 173 million  intangible asset impairment charge was recorded for the cytosport trademark as a result of the 2018 quantitative test one trademark was determined to have fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately a 10 percent margin see additional discussion regarding the company’s goodwill and intangible assets in note d during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  there were no other material remeasurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition 

  

employee benefit plans  the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits in accounting for these employment costs management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates discount rates overall compensation increases expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation 

  

income taxes  the company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur due to passage of the tax act the tax provision at the end of fiscal 2018 was provisional the company will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period allowed which will be completed no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

  

the company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision while the company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable the company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due the company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position this position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 

  

contingent liabilities  at any time the company may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against the company such proceedings typically involve claims 

related to product liability contract disputes wage and hour laws employment practices or other actions brought by employees consumers competitors or suppliers the company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees the company establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against the company when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where the company is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses the company records the amount within that range which constitutes the company’s best estimate the company also discloses the nature and range of loss for claims against the company when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or factors beyond our control

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

hog markets   the company’s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the live hog market to minimize the impact on earnings and to ensure a steady supply of quality hogs the company has entered into contracts with producers for the purchase of hogs at formulabased prices over periods of up to 10 years purchased hogs under contract accounted for 96 percent of the total hogs purchased by the company during fiscal 2018 and 2017 the majority of these contracts use marketbased formulas based on hog futures hog primal values or industry reported hog markets other contracts use a formula based on the cost of production which can fluctuate independently from hog markets the company’s valueadded branded portfolio helps mitigate changes in hog and pork market prices therefore a hypothetical 10 percent change in the cash hog market would have had an immaterial effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

in the second quarter of 2017 the company initiated a hedge program to offset the fluctuation in the company’s future direct hog purchases this program utilizes lean hog futures and these contracts are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts in this program as of october 28 2018  was 07 million before tax compared to 17 million before tax as of october 29 2017 the company measures its market risk exposure on its lean hog futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for lean hogs a 10 percent decrease in the market price for lean hogs would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 28 2018  open lean hog contracts by 25 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased hogs by a similar amount 

  

turkey production costs  the company raises or contracts for live turkeys to meet the majority of its raw material supply requirements production costs in raising turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs under normal longterm market conditions changes in the cost to produce turkeys are offset by proportional changes in the turkey market 

  

to reduce the company’s exposure to changes in grain prices the company utilizes a hedge program to offset the fluctuation in the company’s future direct grain purchases this program utilizes corn futures for jots and these contracts are accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting the fair value of the company’s open futures contracts as of october 28 2018  was 13 million compared to 22 million before tax as of october 29 2017 the company measures its market risk exposure on its grain futures contracts using a sensitivity analysis which considers a hypothetical 10 percent change in the market prices for grain a 10 percent decrease in the market price for grain would have negatively impacted the fair value of the company’s october 28 2018  open grain contracts by 67 million which in turn would lower the company’s future cost on purchased grain by a similar amount 

  

other input costs   the costs of raw materials packaging materials freight fuel and energy may cause the companys results to fluctuate significantly to manage input cost volatility the company pursues cost saving measures forward pricing derivatives and pricing actions when necessary 

  

longterm debt  a principal market risk affecting the company is the exposure to changes in interest rates on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 19 million the fair value of the company’s longterm debt was estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the company’s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 

  

investments  the company has corporateowned life insurance policies classified as trading securities as part of a rabbi trust to fund certain supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans as of october 28 2018  the balance of these securities totaled 1373 million compared to 1285 million as of october 29 2017 a majority of these securities represent fixed income funds the company is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the value of the remaining investments as unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are included in the company’s net earnings on a marktomarket basis a 10 percent decline in the value of the investments not held in fixed income funds would have a direct negative impact to the company’s pretax earnings of approximately 43 million while a 10 percent increase in value would have a positive impact of the same amount 

  

international assets  the fair values of certain company assets are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies the company’s net asset position in foreign currencies as of october 28 2018  was 6877 million compared to 7813 million as of october 29 2017  with most of the exposure existing in chinese yuan and brazilian real changes in currency exchange rates impact the fair values of company assets either currently through the consolidated statements of operations as currency gains losses or by affecting other comprehensive loss 

  

the company measures its foreign currency exchange risk by using a 10 percent sensitivity analysis on the company’s primary foreign net asset position the chinese yuan and the brazilian real as of october 28 2018  a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 510 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 417 million pretax a 10 percent strengthening in the value of the real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive income of approximately 131 million pretax a 10 percent weakening in the value of the real relative to the us dollar would result in other comprehensive loss of approximately 107 million pretax during fiscal 2018 the value of the brazilian real declined 219 percent see note j for additional details

raw materials

the majority of the hogs harvested by the company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in minnesota iowa nebraska and kansas the cost of hogs and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the company uses supply contracts to ensure a stable supply of raw materials the company’s contracts are based on marketbased formulas andor markets of certain swine production inputs 

  

  

to better balance input costs with customer pricing and all contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial statements in fiscal 2017 the company purchased 96 percent of its hogs under supply contracts the company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms it either owns or operates in colorado

the perishable category includes fresh meats frozen items refrigerated meal solutions sausages hams wieners and bacon excluding jots products shelfstable includes canned luncheon meats shelfstable microwaveable meals stews chilies hash meat spreads flour and corn tortillas salsas tortilla chips peanut butter and other items that do not require refrigeration the poultry category is composed primarily of jots products the other category primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements sugar and sugar substitutes dessert and drink mixes and industrial gelatin products

raw materials 

  

the company has for the past several years been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with yearround demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commoditytype products pork continues to be the primary raw material for company products although the live pork industry has evolved to large vertically integrated yearround operations and supply contracts have become prevalent in the industry there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials the company’s expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations 

  

the majority of the hogs harvested by the company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in california colorado illinois iowa kansas minnesota nebraska north dakota oklahoma south dakota texas utah and wisconsin the cost of hogs and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the movement toward larger operations which operate under supply agreements with processors has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market the company like others in the industry uses supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and to ensure a stable supply of raw materials the company’s contracts are based on marketbased formulas andor the cost of production to better balance input costs with customer pricing and all contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial statements in fiscal 2014 the company purchased 94 percent of its hogs under supply contracts the company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms that it either owns or operates in arizona california colorado kansas and wyoming 

  

in fiscal 2014 jots raised turkeys representing approximately 78 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products turkeys not sourced within the company are contracted with 

  

  

independent turkey growers jots’ turkeyraising farms are located throughout minnesota and wisconsin 

  

production costs in raising hogs and turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed grain prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs to manage this risk the company hedges a portion of its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts 

  

manufacturing 

  

the company has three plants that harvest hogs for processing quality pork processors inc of dallas texas operates the harvesting facility at austin minnesota under a custom harvesting arrangement the company currently has seven turkey harvest and processing operations and 37 facilities that produce and distribute other manufactured items albert lea select foods inc operates the processing facility at albert lea minnesota under a custom manufacturing agreement company products are also custom manufactured by several other companies the following are the company’s larger custom manufacturers abbyland foods inc abbotsford wisconsin agropur division natrel usa maplewood minnesota algood food company louisville kentucky cloverleaf cold storage sioux city iowa lakeside packing company manitowoc wisconsin mrs clark’s foods ankeny iowa osi industries llc chicago illinois power packaging st charles illinois reichel foods inc rochester minnesota reser’s fine foods topeka kansas and steuben foods jamaica new york exel inc based in westerville ohio operates distribution centers for the company in dayton ohio and osceola iowa

customers and backlog orders 

  

during fiscal year 2014 sales to walmart stores inc walmart represented approximately 141 percent of the company’s revenues measured as gross sales less returns and allowances compared to 139 percent in fiscal 2013 walmart is a customer for all five segments of the company the five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of segment sales 45 percent of grocery products 35 percent of refrigerated foods 39 percent of jots 42 percent of specialty foods and 26 percent of international  other the loss of one or more of the top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on the results of such segment backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis 

  

competition 

  

the production and sale of meat and food products in the united states and internationally are highly competitive the company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources such as beef chicken fish and peanut butter the company believes that its largest domestic competitors for its refrigerated foods segment in 2014 were tyson foods inc and smithfield foods inc for its grocery products segment conagra foods inc general mills inc campbell soup co and j m smucker co and for jots cargill inc and butterball llc 

  

all segments compete on the basis of price product quality and attributes brand identification breadth of product line and customer service through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs the company’s strategy is to provide 

  

  

higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition which would then support higher value perceptions from customers

raw materials 

  

the company has for the past several years been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with yearround demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commoditytype products pork continues to be the primary raw material for company products although the live pork industry has evolved to large vertically integrated yearround operations and supply contracts have become prevalent in the industry there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials the company’s expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations 

  

the majority of the hogs harvested by the company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in colorado idaho illinois iowa kansas minnesota nebraska north dakota oklahoma south dakota texas utah and wisconsin the cost of hogs and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the movement toward yearround operations which operate under supply agreements with processors has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market the company like others in the industry uses supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and to ensure a stable supply of raw materials the company has converted the majority of its contracts to marketbased formulas to better match input costs with customer pricing and all contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial statements in fiscal 2011 the company purchased 95 percent of its hogs under supply contracts the company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms that it either owns or operates in arizona california colorado kansas and wyoming 

  

in fiscal 2011 jots raised turkeys representing approximately 72 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products turkeys not sourced within the company are contracted with independent turkey growers jots’ turkeyraising farms are located throughout minnesota and wisconsin 

  

production costs in raising hogs and turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed grain prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs to manage this risk the company hedges a portion of its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts

c description of business 

  

products and distribution   the company’s products primarily consist of meat and other food products the meat products are sold fresh frozen cured smoked cooked and canned the percentages of total revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the company are as follows 

  

   

reporting of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail foodservice or international revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the company’s generalpurpose financial statements 

  

  

perishable meat includes fresh meats sausages hams wieners and bacon excluding jots products the poultry category is composed primarily of jots products shelfstable includes canned luncheon meats shelfstable microwaveable entrees stews chilies hash meat spreads flour and corn tortillas salsas tortilla chips and other items that do not require refrigeration the other category primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements sugar and sugar substitutes creamers salt and pepper products sauces and salad dressings dessert and drink mixes and industrial gelatin products 

  

construction of the new production facility in dubuque iowa continues which will provide additional capacity for canned and microwave tray items beginning in january 2010 no other new products in fiscal 2009 required a material investment of the company’s assets 

  

domestically the company sells its products in all 50 states the company’s products are sold through its sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated from sales offices located in most of the larger us cities as well as independent brokers and distributors dedicated sales teams also serve major retail customers and coordinate sales of both grocery products and refrigerated foods products as of october 25 2009 the company had approximately 662 sales personnel engaged in selling its products distribution of products to customers is primarily by common carrier

raw materials   the company has for the past several years been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with yearround demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commoditytype products pork continues to be the primary raw material for company products although the live pork industry has evolved to large vertically integrated yearround confinement operations and supply contracts have become prevalent in the industry there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials the company’s expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations 

  

the majority of the hogs harvested by the company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in colorado idaho illinois iowa kansas minnesota nebraska oklahoma south dakota texas utah wisconsin and canada the cost of hogs and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the movement toward yearround confinement operations which operate under supply agreements with processors has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market the company along with others in the industry uses supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and to ensure a stable supply of raw materials the company has converted the majority of its contracts to marketbased formulas to better match input costs with customer pricing and all contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial statements in fiscal 2009 the company purchased 93 percent of its hogs under supply contracts the company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms that it either owns or operates in arizona california colorado kansas and wyoming 

  

in fiscal 2009 jots raised turkeys representing approximately 69 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products turkeys not sourced within the company are contracted with independent turkey growers jots’ turkeyraising farms are located throughout minnesota and wisconsin

c   description of business 

products and distribution 

the company’s products primarily consist of meat and other food products the meat products are sold fresh frozen cured smoked cooked and canned the percentages of total revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the company are as follows 

 

  

reporting of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail foodservice or international revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the company’s generalpurpose financial statements 

perishable meat includes fresh meats sausages hams wieners and bacon excluding jots products the perishable meat category increased in fiscal 2005 mainly due to the acquisition of farmer john in december 2004 shelfstable includes canned luncheon meats shelfstable microwaveable entrees stews chilies hash meat spreads flour and corn tortillas salsas tortilla chips and other items that do not require refrigeration as well as frozen processed products the poultry category is composed primarily of jots products the other category primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements sugar

in fiscal 2005 the company introduced deli luncheon meats with no preservatives for retail and foodservice customers using true taste technology high pressure processing this initiative is proceeding on target with company expectations no other new product in fiscal 2005 required a material investment of the company assets 

domestically the company sells its products in all 50 states hormel products are sold through company sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated from sales offices located in most of the larger us cities as well as independent brokers and distributors during fiscal 2004 dedicated sales teams were also developed to serve major retail customers and coordinate sales of both grocery products and refrigerated foods products as of october 30 2005 the company had approximately 610 sales personnel engaged in selling its products distribution of products to customers is primarily by common carrier

raw materials 

the company has for the past several years been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with yearround demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity type products pork continues to be the primary raw material for company products although the live pork industry has recently evolved to large vertically integrated yearround confinement operations and supply contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials the company’s expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations 

the majority of the hogs harvested by the company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in minnesota illinois iowa nebraska south dakota texas oklahoma colorado california and utah the cost of hogs and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the movement toward yearround confinement operations which operate under supply agreements with processors has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market which decreases the supply of hogs on the open market the company along with others in the industry uses supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and to ensure a stable supply of raw materials contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial results in fiscal 2005 the company purchased 69 percent of its hogs under supply contracts the farmer john operation also procures a portion of its hogs through farms which the company either owns or operates in arizona california and wyoming 

in fiscal 2005 jots raised approximately 55 percent of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products turkeys not sourced within the company are contracted with independent turkey growers jots’ turkeyraising farms are located throughout minnesota and wisconsin production costs in raising turkeys are primarily subject to fluctuations in feed grain prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs to manage this risk the company periodically hedges its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts 

manufacturing 

the company has plants in austin minnesota fremont nebraska vernon california and beijing china that harvest hogs for processing quality pork processors inc of dallas texas operates the harvesting facility at austin under a custom harvesting arrangement 

facilities that produce manufactured items are located in albert lea minnesota algona iowa alma kansas aurora illinois austin minnesota beloit wisconsin bondurant iowa bremen georgia browerville minnesota ft dodge iowa fremont nebraska houston texas knoxville iowa long prairie minnesota mitchellville iowa new berlin wisconsin osceola iowa perrysburg ohio quakertown pennsylvania rochelle illinois savannah georgia sparta wisconsin st paul minnesota stockton california tucker georgia vernon california visalia california wichita kansas beijing china and shanghai china albert lea select foods inc of dallas texas operates the processing facility at albert lea under a custom manufacturing agreement company products are also custom manufactured by several other companies the following are the company’s larger custom manufacturers lakeside packing company manitowoc wisconsin schroeder milk maplewood minnesota steuben foods jamaica new york power packaging st charles illinois criders stilmore georgia and tony downs st james minnesota power logistics inc based in st charles illinois operates distribution centers for the company in dayton ohio and osceola iowa 

the company’s turkey harvest and processing operations are located in barron wisconsin faribault minnesota melrose minnesota montevideo minnesota pelican rapids minnesota and willmar minnesota 

patents and trademarks 

there are numerous patents and trademarks that are important to the company’s business the company holds seven foreign and 47 us issued patents some of the trademarks are registered and some are not in recognition of the importance of these assets the company created a subsidiary hormel foods llc in 1998 to create own maintain and protect most of the company’s trademarks and patents some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used in the company’s segments are 

hormel always tender american classics austin blues black label bread ready cafÉ h california natural carapelli chichi’s cure 81 curemaster dan’s prize di lusso dinty moore dodger dogs dubuque el torito farmer john gringo pete’s fast ‘n easy herbox herdez homeland house of tsang jennieo turkey store kid’s kitchen layout little sizzlers lloyd’s manny’s marrakesh express mary kitchen mexican accent old smokehouse patak’s peloponnese pillow pack range brand rosa sandwich maker spam stagg sweet thing thick  easy and wranglers 

the company’s patents expire after a term that is typically 20 years from the date of filing with earlier expiration possible based on the company’s decision to pay required maintenance fees as long as the company intends to continue using its trademarks they are renewed indefinitely 

customers and backlog orders 

during fiscal year 2005 no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total company sales the five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of segment sales 47 percent of grocery products 35 percent of refrigerated foods 32 percent of jots 35 percent of specialty foods and 19 percent of all other the loss of one or more of the top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on the results of such segment backlog orders are not 

significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis 

competition 

the production and sale of meat and food products in the united states and internationally are highly competitive the company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources such as beef chicken and fish the company believes that its largest domestic competitors for its refrigerated foods segment in 2005 were tyson foods smithfield foods and conagra foods for its grocery products segment conagra foods dial corp and campbell soup co and for jots conagra foods and cargill inc 

all segments compete on the basis of price product quality brand identification and customer service through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs the company’s strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition which would then support higher value perceptions from customers 

the company competes using this same strategy in international markets around the world

livestock slaughtered by the company is purchased by company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns and terminal markets or under longterm supply contracts at locations principally in minnesota illinois iowa nebraska and south dakota the cost of livestock and the utilization of the company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the united states the hog production industry has been rapidly moving to very large vertically integrated yearround confinement operations operating under longterm supply agreements this has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market which decreases the supply of hogs on the open market and can severely diminish the utilization of slaughter facilities and increase the cost of the raw materials they produce the company along with others in the industry uses longterm supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and to assure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the longterm this may result in costs for live hogs that are either higher or lower than the spot cash market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices contract costs are fully reflected in the company’s reported financial results in fiscal 2004 the company purchased 67 percent of its hogs under longterm supply contracts 

in fiscal 2004 jots raised approximately 54 percent of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products turkeys not sourced within the company are contracted with independent turkey growers jots’ turkeyraising farms are located throughout minnesota and wisconsin production costs in raising turkeys are primarily subject to fluctuations in feed grain prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs as part of the company’s risk management program the company periodically hedges its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts the company measures the effectiveness of these hedges on a regular basis and has determined all such hedges to be highly effective in reducing the company’s exposure to price fluctuations in the cash grain market
